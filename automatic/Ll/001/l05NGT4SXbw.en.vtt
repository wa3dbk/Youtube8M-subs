00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.170
 hi friends how many times when you go to 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.140
 doctor with back pain we have 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.050
 listened to you should do swimming for 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.750
 relieve your back pain this vision 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.599
 so unsuccessful way more part of the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.660
 medicine of the 50s that of the current 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.029
 and in this video we explain why the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.010
 swimming is not the best choice if 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 we have back pain 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.609
 back ailments are at 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.980
 agenda 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.980
 lumbalgia if cervicalgias copan the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.680
 medical consultations normally when 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.050
 we go to the doctor he recommends us 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.390
 that we do swimming many years ago 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.149
 that is extended that swimming will go 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.549
 well for the back an affirmation so 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.199
 rooted in our society that results 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.869
 risky to put it in doubt 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.600
 the first thing is to clarify what we want 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.119
 say with swimming the doctor simply 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.509
 tells us to go to the pool 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.659
 swim 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:12.770
 nothing else and anyone understands 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.500
 swim how to do crawl stroke and back is 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.710
 say we swim as we know or rather 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.350
 as we can and that is exactly that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.630
 problem swimming any of these 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.509
 styles in the wrong way can 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.700
 even aggravate our ailment just a 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.280
 the first physical problem that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.610
 present professional swimmers 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.959
 It is usually back pain 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.729
 unfortunately swimming styles 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.230
 and even well narrated are 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.290
 counterproductive to 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.570
 back let's see one by one the effects 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.960
 that the crawl the breaststroke and the back 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.420
 produces in our spine in 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.120
 the style of crawl you have to keep the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.940
 horizontality thing difficult if I do not have 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.490
 a lot of lumbar muscles should do 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 an extra effort in the lumbar area to 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.160
 maintain a horizontal position and that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.550
 overloading the bottom of my 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.830
 back and careful breathing 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.380
 every 2-3 strokes we will have to take the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.020
 head to catch air if not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.610
 we have a technique refined at the time 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.120
 of breathing our neck will suffer 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.970
 breaststroke style this style requires us 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.580
 a non-horizontal position but a medium in 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.980
 diagonal within the water this style already 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.040
 it entails a pressure on the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.450
 lumbar and cervical when maintaining a 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.450
 hyperextension position 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.799
 Back style also forces us to 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.200
 maintain horizontality within the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.260
 water so the lumbar ones will be 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.599
 punished but also if we do not swim 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.540
 relaxed and we do not know how to maintain 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.390
 head in an optimal position our 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.290
 cervicals will contract easily and 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.689
 we will have risk of injury 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.849
 then swimming is bad for 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.579
 our back if we understand from 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.829
 swimming like swimming styles and we have 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.719
 some back problem the first 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.569
 recommendation of a good professional 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.549
 It would be not to swim styles 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.849
 now well the water so can we 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.569
 relieve back problems then the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.510
 response is aquatic activities that 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.879
 is the key to being in the water 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.099
 our body floats what relieves 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.859
 joint pressure suffered by the back 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.799
 hip and knees by the force of the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.379
 seriousness if we combine this effect of 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.019
 decompression with analytical movements 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.200
 we will get a huge benefit in 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.810
 comparison with swimming throw yourself to 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.909
 look for aquagym classes within very 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.370
 little we will publish a protocol of 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.980
 exercises in water that will help you with 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.440
 your back problems 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.319
 Water is good but watch what 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.180
 we do inside of it I hope that a 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.040
 from now on you have the value of 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.349
 correct all those who
