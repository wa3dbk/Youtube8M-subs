00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.720 

now<00:00:14.110> we're<00:00:14.259> going<00:00:14.349> to<00:00:14.410> remove<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.889> cast<00:00:15.130> and

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
now we're going to remove the cast and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.410 
now we're going to remove the cast and
so<00:00:16.660> we'll<00:00:16.840> start<00:00:17.080> out<00:00:17.260> by<00:00:17.760> obviously<00:00:18.760> taking

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
so we'll start out by obviously taking

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.090 
so we'll start out by obviously taking
out<00:00:19.510> to<00:00:19.630> that<00:00:19.780> wrap<00:00:19.990> I'll<00:00:20.470> just<00:00:20.650> remove<00:00:20.950> the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
out to that wrap I'll just remove the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.900 
out to that wrap I'll just remove the
Vet<00:00:21.250> Wrap

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.030 

roll<00:00:27.910> up<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.090> stockinette<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:29.050> now<00:00:29.380> to

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
roll up the stockinette and now to

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.069 
roll up the stockinette and now to
remove<00:00:30.250> this<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:30.730> cast<00:00:31.000> cutter<00:00:31.330> we're

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
remove this to the cast cutter we're

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.960 
remove this to the cast cutter we're
gonna<00:00:32.169> cut<00:00:32.500> on<00:00:32.739> this<00:00:33.100> side<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:33.730> then<00:00:33.850> the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
gonna cut on this side and then the

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.080 
gonna cut on this side and then the
opposite<00:00:34.390> side<00:00:34.630> and<00:00:34.930> then<00:00:35.050> just<00:00:35.080> pry<00:00:35.470> this<00:00:35.530> off

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
opposite side and then just pry this off

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:53.200 
opposite side and then just pry this off
so<00:00:37.090> we'll<00:00:37.360> start<00:00:37.630> this

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.940 

so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> typically<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.680> just

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
so I typically start out that way just

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.680 
so I typically start out that way just
itching<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> line<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.970> know<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.630> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
itching a line so I know where I want to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:18.200 
itching a line so I know where I want to
go<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.170> I'll<00:00:58.320> turn<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> high<00:00:58.920> speed

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:31.289 

now<00:01:19.210> we'll<00:01:19.420> switch<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.900> other<00:01:19.960> side

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.899 

okay<00:01:32.299> now<00:01:32.540> we've<00:01:32.719> cut<00:01:32.960> both<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.950> lateral<00:01:34.189> and

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
okay now we've cut both the lateral and

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.389 
okay now we've cut both the lateral and
medial<00:01:34.939> outside<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.020> inside<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.159> split

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
medial outside and inside and we split

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.550 
medial outside and inside and we split
the<00:01:37.490> caste<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:38.930> we're<00:01:39.049> going<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> use<00:01:39.350> this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the caste and so we're going to use this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:48.730 
the caste and so we're going to use this
instrument<00:01:39.979> now<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.369> pry<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.119> open

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.410 

so<00:01:49.740> some<00:01:49.980> people<00:01:50.130> call<00:01:50.370> us<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.550> bivalve<00:01:50.880> when

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so some people call us a bivalve when

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
so some people call us a bivalve when
you<00:01:51.510> cut<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.900> off<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.440> fashion<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
you cut this off in this fashion and you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.300 
you cut this off in this fashion and you
can<00:01:53.790> use<00:01:54.150> this<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> save<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.190> as

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
can use this and save this and use it as

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
can use this and save this and use it as
splint<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.910> tape<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.690> back<00:01:57.900> and<00:01:58.230> put<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:58.830> back

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
splint and tape it back and put it back

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.890 
splint and tape it back and put it back
on<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.490> tape<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> back<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> horse's<00:02:00.720> leg

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
on and tape it back on the horse's leg

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.810 
on and tape it back on the horse's leg
if<00:02:01.080> you'd<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.400> future<00:02:02.730> if

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
if you'd like to in the in the future if

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.290 
if you'd like to in the in the future if
there's<00:02:03.030> some<00:02:03.210> reason<00:02:03.510> for<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.220> then<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:06.150> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
there's some reason for that then as you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.670 
there's some reason for that then as you
can<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.660> cast<00:02:06.900> cutter<00:02:07.140> did<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.500> go

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
can see the cast cutter did not go

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520 
can see the cast cutter did not go
through<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> cast<00:02:08.220> padding<00:02:09.200> remove<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.320> cast

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
through the cast padding remove the cast

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.870 
through the cast padding remove the cast
padding

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.800 

so<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.720> provides<00:02:19.080> plenty<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.590> padding

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
so this provides plenty of padding

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.470 
so this provides plenty of padding
underneath<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.080> cast<00:02:22.350> material<00:02:26.210> now<00:02:27.210> we'll

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
underneath that cast material now we'll

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
underneath that cast material now we'll
just<00:02:27.660> cut<00:02:28.320> off<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.710> stock<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.220> that's<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
just cut off the stock and that's the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.720 
just cut off the stock and that's the
easiest<00:02:29.790> way<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.450> off
