00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.490
 it went against teams like swollen lex 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.140
 last season you are wrong now 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.260
 feeling that it will now be better against it 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.670
 these kind of smaller opponents 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.990
 well or the last season I went wrong 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.939
 think it's a start to season right 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.189
 went well and I think the start of it 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.019
 season went wrong against larger teams 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.060
 at the end of the season we got again 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.509
 trouble or got some more trouble with 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.939
 need small shifts and soggy 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.619
 yes how they play i think i don't find any 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.159
 small team that play just fine 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.470
 play football 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.840
 yes I think it will be different this year 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.800
 we must have fewer points away 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.359
 in such competitions 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.710
 yes, back to that game 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.120
 then his just played well in one 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.219
 offensive and a lot of pressure on you 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.600
 they could sit naturally make up for 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.739
 it was that match that we the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.539
 first twenty minutes just not with 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.239
 the lesson was that we in and poop and 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.090
 shit that we were there and that 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.129
 we had to give yes heaped more like 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.960
 had to give a full bowl to yes there 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.879
 finally equal again 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.449
 informed and in the second half 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.920
 We get a nice chance to get two 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.089
 three to come and finally the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.070
 take control of it but it 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.119
 does not happen yes we come out of something 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.079
 back behind 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.000
 and then we are no longer beyond 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.079
 first came in several respects though 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.640
 important to be right there anyway 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.020
 show results that show 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 you indeed count and count 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 can do to those upper spots 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.850
 again 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 you definitely have to start the competition 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.909
 anyway good start to get 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 then twente home and ajax out that is 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.200
 they are also not the easiest matches 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.790
 its all not easy but if you 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.799
 watch a program then we are 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.060
 actually mandatory if you want to come 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.810
 turn around to be the first anyway 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.820
 to win a competition 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.320
 now i have a long preparation like 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.270
 the bridge and so a question where you 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770
 you can be the only indication of this 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.420
 give or is that difficult 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.649
 well i find it difficult i find it 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.390
 very hard to say 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.460
 so another team is going to look the only one 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.990
 the one has greatly strengthened the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.789
 the other has remained the same at edges 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 There are very many players leaving and those 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.820
 have become weaker with 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 so yes i i i dont know where you what you 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.560
 must say 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.330
 where we stand I think that's after 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.010
 four games as the transfer period 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.479
 close I think you can say 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.190
 where you stand 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.050
 Now there is a second too late and 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.750
 third she can draw on form 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.289
 for a similar classification 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.750
 but yes or I was at home signing that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.310
 must also be the beginning of the competition that 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.350
 also from we are final 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.430
 and see where I stand in the winter break 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.130
 think that's a very important thing 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.980
 measurement point and I think if you just then 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.170
 like last season also at a point or 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.239
 that is three points behind the leader 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.120
 Then you can say that you do 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.489
 ajax is also playing with you I your 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.980
 favorite again this season 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.810
 yes how you say well i am not there either 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.459
 left a lot 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.520
 they want another player recovered from 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.700
 barcelona farmer jan 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.280
 is just very good player and fm like me 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.800
 say that's very hard to say 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 it can afresh work that and that the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.850
 plow like ajax there in three years 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.190
 have performed a three year me with him 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 and play with each other but it is also possible 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.810
 They are fantastic when the weather 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.540
 go do it i'm talking to az i got you 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.620
 seen so start so with also 208 there 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 ajax is too 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.650
 you have one for yourself 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.019
 objective for the coming competition 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.040
 previous will be fairly easy here 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.269
 adjusted 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.230
 Do you now have one for yourself? 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.510
 other higher consent 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.709
 well how well do statement if you like 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.630
 football player are the 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.100
 you enter it in the tub and it is 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.390
 it is not easy for many players 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.640
 been here to enter the cockpit 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.989
 come in their first year one and you then 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.430
 own you to profile yourself on 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.620
 the way I did last year 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.420
 done i start it was a bit difficult 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 and then it went better 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.920
 yes and in the end i got it right 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.989
 closed and your goal as a player 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.830
 now you always want better, but 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.230
 is not always possible 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.569
 and then you go ahead and I work on the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.209
 training worked extremely hard for it and it 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.830
 trust is therefore buying with that 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.750
 coming year to take more steps 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.310
 you still done very well is one of 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.690
 points for improvement says by come to it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.160
 You can take advantage of opportunities there 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.650
 At all to work on frame or need 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.180
 We also just see in you the playback 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.220
 well it you can work on that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.430
 also has to do with a bit of rest 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.340
 for the goal and I often have enough 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.380
 talked about with roy makaay you too 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.600
 at the training sessions last season 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.010
 their were present and talent that is one 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.680
 matter of practicing a lot or can you 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.600
 learn to rest here 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 no you can go and learn it yourself 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.630
 basically the rest I have yes it is 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.810
 now maybe a little more too 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.310
 concentration for the goal and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.770
 just strike at the right time and 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.820
 if that happens this year then 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.350
 think it will be a very nice year 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.160
 be you see in again a new one 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.410
 season 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.850
 yes always preparation never tick this way 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.500
 as a player, there are hardly ever so many 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.919
 warmer yes that you have of course 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.360
 time required to yes to get fit and 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.039
 all together again good team spirit 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.510
 get together and we have it 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.060
 also done in those in those five six weeks 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.060
 time and 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.870
 now it looks good I am curious 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.870
 to next Sunday
