using one friend code for each handheld
which<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.120> better<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.800> improved<00:02:26.220> on

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
which is better but if they improved on

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.830 
which is better but if they improved on
it<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.640> made<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.880> something<00:02:27.030> similar<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> the
