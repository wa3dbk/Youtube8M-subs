I<00:00:12.389> wondered<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.080> point<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.559> went

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
reason you thought that you could maybe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
shots well you know with this team when

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.199 
shots well you know with this team when
we<00:02:13.900> don't<00:02:14.080> shoot<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.410> ball<00:02:14.560> well<00:02:14.739> were<00:02:15.209> not

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
we don't shoot the ball well were not

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.809 
we don't shoot the ball well were not
real<00:02:16.810> productive<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.890> know<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.489> felt

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
real productive but you know we felt

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.250 
real productive but you know we felt
like<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> game<00:02:19.599> if<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.140> could

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
like going in the game if we could

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.110 
like going in the game if we could
rebound<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.800> ball<00:02:20.950> effectively<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
rebound the ball effectively on the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
rebound the ball effectively on the
defensive<00:02:22.569> end<00:02:22.750> because<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:23.380> they<00:02:23.560> send<00:02:23.860> a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
defensive end because they they send a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.360 
defensive end because they they send a
lot<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.100> guys<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:25.350> which<00:02:26.350> they're<00:02:26.950> great<00:02:27.190> at

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
lot of guys and which they're great at

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
lot of guys and which they're great at
it<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:27.730> if<00:02:28.450> we<00:02:28.660> could<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:28.810> give<00:02:29.080> some<00:02:29.290> clean

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it but if we could just give some clean

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.530 
it but if we could just give some clean
ones<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:30.430> felt<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.940> could<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.239> out<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
ones we felt like we could get out and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.870
