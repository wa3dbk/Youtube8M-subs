stator<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.969> can<00:01:11.240> get<00:01:11.450> revived<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.079> there's<00:01:12.679> a

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
stator you can get revived and there's a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.340 
stator you can get revived and there's a
possibility<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:13.459> getting<00:01:13.639> more<00:01:13.999> kills<00:01:14.539> that's

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350

why I play search and rescue because you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.029 
why I play search and rescue because you

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
opportunities to give more kills so we

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.179
