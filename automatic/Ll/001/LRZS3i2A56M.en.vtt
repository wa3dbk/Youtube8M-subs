00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that method so it's safe um other than

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
that method so it's safe um other than
that<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.200> Tegra<00:01:43.710> overclock<00:01:45.890> load

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that you can use Tegra overclock load

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.630 
that you can use Tegra overclock load
overclock<00:01:47.460> module<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.130> overclock

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
overclock module and you can overclock

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.230 
overclock module and you can overclock
it<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.979> 1.6<00:01:53.899> mm-hmm<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.880> now

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it to 1.6 mm-hmm so that's good and now

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260 
it to 1.6 mm-hmm so that's good and now
let<00:01:57.420> me<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.049> else<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.619> show<00:01:58.649> you
