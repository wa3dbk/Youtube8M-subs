00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.179
 If an island like Haiti, 

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.469
 had several thousand million dollars 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.966
 property; but then take it 

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:10.409
 and they print more money than they cover the property or their gold. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.049
 In this case, that money is worthless. If a small island, say like 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.195
 Santa Cruz, printed a lot of money and came to the United States 

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.059
 to buy - day and night have printed money - 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 this money is uncoated, and they actually have nothing. 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.229
 The whole banking system is corrupt. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.739
 Credit institutions have ruined the system. 

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.229
 But there is no one to tell you what is wrong, 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.014
 So, everything looks good to you. 

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.339
 National debt is already too big 

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.242
 for the diagram showing it. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 Failed systems 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.300
 None of the economic systems manages to eliminate our most significant problems 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.245
 To this day, wars exist in all social systems 

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:55.067
 poverty, crime, racism, elitism, and above all: 

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.691
 poverty. 

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.338
 Today's system can not be fair. 

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.041
 We need to build a human rights system. 

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.981
 When everyone has free access to goods and services 

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.819
 there is no struggle for human rights because 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.145
 human rights are automatically secured in a system set up for that purpose 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.754
 Today, technology is high, but social 

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:21.945
 and our economic system lags behind technological capabilities 

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.516
 which can easily create abundance in the world enough for all people 

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.666
 a world without bondage and duty. 

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.802
 This system will continue to introduce more and more automation 

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:34.118
 reducing the purchasing power of the majority of people. 

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:38.046
 India and China are not to blame for unemployment 

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.234
 the machines prevailed over the man 

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.659
 There will be a moment in the society called Gaussian curve 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.945
 when labor falls. Production will jump up 

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.277
 , and the purchasing power will fly down, then the system will stop. 

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.249
 Social alternative 

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:58.048
 Our problems and their decisions are technical, not political. 

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:02.042
 Most problems are solved when technology and the scientific method 

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:06.328
 be used for the well-being of man and nature 

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:08.321
 rather than the selected group. 

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:13.112
 Everything will be in a dynamic equilibrium. 

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.722
 This means functioning of the limit of possibilities 

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:21.272
 without neglecting the environment. 

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:27.179
 When we apply science and technology directly to the social system 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.961
 without any financial constraints 

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.822
 or patents, we can achieve a high standard of living 

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.472
 for a very short period of time. 

00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:43.699
 We have the mental and technical abilities 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.672
 to create a completely new civilization. 

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:50.078
 Paradise or oblivion 

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:54.615
