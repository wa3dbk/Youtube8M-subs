exception<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.100> need<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
exception so this is what you need a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
exception so this is what you need a
little<00:00:40.290> spray<00:00:40.620> bottle<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.700> just

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
little spray bottle which I just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
little spray bottle which I just
recycled<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.620> sure<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
recycled this and make sure it's a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
recycled this and make sure it's a
darker<00:00:44.700> colored<00:00:45.390> spray<00:00:45.809> bottle<00:00:46.200> because

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
darker colored spray bottle because

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
darker colored spray bottle because
we're<00:00:46.649> using<00:00:46.770> essential<00:00:47.430> oils<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we're using essential oils in this and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
we're using essential oils in this and
you<00:00:48.719> don't<00:00:48.930> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.680> clear<00:00:50.100> bottle

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you don't want to use a clear bottle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.420 
you don't want to use a clear bottle
because<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.210> oils<00:00:51.629> absorb<00:00:52.559> light<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.129> they

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
because the oils absorb light and they

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
because the oils absorb light and they
need<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.000> darker<00:00:54.360> bottle<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
need to be in a darker bottle so it is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.130 
need to be in a darker bottle so it is
plastic<00:00:56.010> most<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.180> better<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> use
