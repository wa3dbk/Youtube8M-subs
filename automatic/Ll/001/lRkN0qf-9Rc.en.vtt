big this is an 18 inch fan

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
big this is an 18 inch fan
it<00:00:52.770> sings<00:00:52.980> put<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.309> over<00:00:53.460> 4000<00:00:54.239> CFM<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.840> high

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050

we've got a bunch if you guys are
interested<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:02.730> buying<00:02:03.730> them<00:02:03.910> off<00:02:04.030> me<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.270> test

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
interested in buying them off me I test

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.100 
interested in buying them off me I test
them<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.020> clean<00:02:05.350> them<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:06.270> sell<00:02:07.270> them<00:02:07.390> anywhere

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
condition and once in a blue moon I run

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.610 
condition and once in a blue moon I run
into<00:02:14.670> situation<00:02:15.670> where<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:17.140> low<00:02:17.260> speeds

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
into situation where the low speeds

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.310 
into situation where the low speeds
burned<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:19.270> usually<00:02:19.450> something<00:02:19.960> simple

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
burned out it's usually something simple

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.080 
burned out it's usually something simple
there's<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> resistor<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.070> there<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.700> don't

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
there's a resistor in there but I don't

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.400 
there's a resistor in there but I don't
mess<00:02:22.210> with<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.630> just<00:02:22.690> use<00:02:22.960> them<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> high

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
mess with it I just use them as a high

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350 
mess with it I just use them as a high
speed<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.430> everyone<00:02:24.700> prefers<00:02:24.970> them<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
speed but everyone prefers them for the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.790 
speed but everyone prefers them for the
low<00:02:25.480> speed<00:02:25.780> especially<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.320> rock<00:02:26.470> crawler

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
low speed especially the rock crawler

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.480 
low speed especially the rock crawler
guys<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.640> they're<00:02:27.760> not<00:02:27.880> sitting<00:02:28.180> there<00:02:28.270> just

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
guys so they're not sitting there just

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.710 
guys so they're not sitting there just
get<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> thing<00:02:30.640> running<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.150> running<00:02:31.300> around

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720
