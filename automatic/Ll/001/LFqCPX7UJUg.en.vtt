00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the controller and it just slightly

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
the controller and it just slightly
wraps<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.660> bottom<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.530> the

rebellion logo right there on the right
of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> controller<00:00:56.120> which<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.609> oddly

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
of the controller which is kind of oddly

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.250 
of the controller which is kind of oddly
shaped<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.149> mean<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.480> looks<00:01:00.660> cool<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.230> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
shaped I mean it looks cool and all but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
shaped I mean it looks cool and all but
I<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.879> something<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
I don't know something about it just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.500 
I don't know something about it just
kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.199> throws<00:01:04.470> me<00:01:04.500> off<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.060> bet<00:01:06.330> there

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
kind of throws me off but I bet there

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.710 
kind of throws me off but I bet there
are<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.260> other<00:01:08.070> Star<00:01:09.000> Wars<00:01:09.210> controllers

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
are gonna be other Star Wars controllers

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.760 
are gonna be other Star Wars controllers
coming<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:11.150> it<00:01:12.150> has<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> nice<00:01:12.780> white<00:01:13.170> smooth

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
coming out it has a nice white smooth

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.609 
coming out it has a nice white smooth
finish<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> nice<00:01:14.729> gloss<00:01:15.350> which<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.560> don't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
finish it's a nice gloss which I don't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.850 
finish it's a nice gloss which I don't
mind<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:19.380> gameplay

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
mind but if you're really into gameplay

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
mind but if you're really into gameplay
and<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.000> into<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.450> may<00:01:21.600> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and you get really into it may your

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
and you get really into it may your
hands<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.409> sweaty<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
hands get a little sweaty I can see that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
hands get a little sweaty I can see that
maybe<00:01:24.090> being<00:01:24.479> an<00:01:24.630> issue<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.170> other<00:01:25.350> than<00:01:25.470> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
maybe being an issue but other than that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
maybe being an issue but other than that
the<00:01:26.549> grip<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.570> too<00:01:28.290> bad<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> for

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the grip on this is not too bad and for

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.289 
the grip on this is not too bad and for
a<00:01:30.720> cosmetic<00:01:31.409> thing<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.890> could<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.729> these<00:01:32.970> thumb

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a cosmetic thing I could see these thumb

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.260 
a cosmetic thing I could see these thumb
sticks<00:01:33.979> yellowing<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.340> quick<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.000> from

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
sticks yellowing pretty quick just from

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780 
sticks yellowing pretty quick just from
overuse<00:01:36.810> from<00:01:37.680> rubbing<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.070> skin<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.490> all

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
overuse from rubbing on skin and all

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
overuse from rubbing on skin and all
that<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> could<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.689> those<00:01:39.840> dirtying<00:01:40.500> up

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that so I could see those dirtying up

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.810 
that so I could see those dirtying up
pretty<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:42.770> has<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.950> your<00:01:44.100> basic<00:01:44.490> features

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
of an Xbox one controller there's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
of an Xbox one controller there's
nothing<00:01:47.159> you're<00:01:47.310> missing<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.840> does

gonna have with these third-party

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.889 
gonna have with these third-party
controllers<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.270> they<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.750> be

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
controllers that they might not be

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
controllers that they might not be
capable<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> things<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.340> are

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
have not had any d-pad problems but yet

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.360 
have not had any d-pad problems but yet
again<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.600> haven't<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.260> done<00:04:34.040> anything

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
again I haven't really done anything

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.550 
again I haven't really done anything
with<00:04:34.639> this<00:04:35.060> controller<00:04:35.480> that<00:04:35.750> involves<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
with this controller that involves the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.840 
with this controller that involves the
d-pad<00:04:37.210> it's<00:04:38.210> mostly<00:04:38.540> been<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> lot<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.050> joystick

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
d-pad it's mostly been a lot of joystick

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.580 
d-pad it's mostly been a lot of joystick
and<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.030> does<00:04:41.240> have<00:04:41.450> the<00:04:41.630> nice<00:04:41.810> ribbed<00:04:42.169> texture

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
and it does have the nice ribbed texture

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.550 
and it does have the nice ribbed texture
along<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.250> edge<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:44.030> joysticks<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.470> you

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
along the edge of the joysticks so you

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.740 
along the edge of the joysticks so you
do<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.310> nice<00:04:46.580> grip<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.150> them<00:04:47.330> when<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.720> are

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
do have a nice grip on them when you are

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.180 
do have a nice grip on them when you are
playing<00:04:49.990> but<00:04:50.990> overall<00:04:51.350> this<00:04:51.710> is<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.950> pretty

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
playing but overall this is a pretty

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.680 
playing but overall this is a pretty
good<00:04:52.370> controller<00:04:52.820> especially<00:04:53.390> if<00:04:53.510> you're<00:04:53.660> a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
good controller especially if you're a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.470 
good controller especially if you're a
star<00:04:53.930> Wars<00:04:53.960> fan<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.880> just<00:04:56.120> want<00:04:56.300> to<00:04:56.330> get

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
star Wars fan and you just want to get

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.540 
star Wars fan and you just want to get
another<00:04:57.169> controller<00:04:57.590> for<00:04:57.800> your<00:04:57.950> Xbox

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
another controller for your Xbox

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.409 
another controller for your Xbox
the<00:04:59.480> price<00:04:59.990> point<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.560> $49.99<00:05:01.480> and<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:04.419> believe

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
the price point is $49.99 and I believe

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.060 
the price point is $49.99 and I believe
that's<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.870> little<00:05:06.080> steep

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
that's a little steep

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.330 
that's a little steep
I<00:05:07.100> believe<00:05:08.410> thirty<00:05:09.410> would<00:05:09.770> probably<00:05:10.070> been<00:05:10.190> the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
I believe thirty would probably been the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.630 
I believe thirty would probably been the
best<00:05:10.550> bet<00:05:10.820> for<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:13.190> ten<00:05:13.490> bucks

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
best bet for this but it's ten bucks

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.790 
best bet for this but it's ten bucks
less<00:05:13.940> than<00:05:14.120> an<00:05:14.180> Xbox<00:05:14.540> one<00:05:14.630> controller<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:15.440> in

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
less than an Xbox one controller so in

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.480 
less than an Xbox one controller so in
the<00:05:16.310> end<00:05:16.460> that's<00:05:16.610> truly<00:05:17.120> up<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.270> you<00:05:17.600> if<00:05:17.840> you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
the end that's truly up to you if you

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.250 
the end that's truly up to you if you
really<00:05:19.510> want<00:05:20.510> to<00:05:20.630> get<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.750> wired<00:05:20.990> controller

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
really want to get a wired controller

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.920 
really want to get a wired controller
for<00:05:21.740> fifty<00:05:22.040> bucks<00:05:22.250> but<00:05:23.030> for<00:05:23.270> me<00:05:23.360> being<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.690> Star

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
for fifty bucks but for me being a Star

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.630 
for fifty bucks but for me being a Star
Wars<00:05:24.110> fan<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.590> everything<00:05:24.979> else<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.310> enjoy

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
with collecting astromechs this was a

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.760 
with collecting astromechs this was a
given<00:05:29.360> for<00:05:29.570> me<00:05:29.690> plus<00:05:30.169> I<00:05:30.320> needed<00:05:30.530> another

given for me plus I needed another

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.130 
given for me plus I needed another
controller<00:05:31.370> for<00:05:31.550> my<00:05:31.669> Xbox<00:05:32.120> one<00:05:32.710> but<00:05:33.710> overall

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
controller for my Xbox one but overall

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.440 
controller for my Xbox one but overall
pretty<00:05:36.140> cool<00:05:36.320> controller<00:05:36.820> love<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:38.030> design

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
pretty cool controller love the design

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.920 
pretty cool controller love the design
of<00:05:38.600> it<00:05:38.720> I<00:05:38.780> love<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.080> feel<00:05:39.289> that<00:05:40.720> buttons<00:05:41.720> work

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
of it I love the feel that buttons work

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.900 
of it I love the feel that buttons work
very<00:05:42.620> well<00:05:42.710> very<00:05:43.220> responsive<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:45.910> will

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
very well very responsive and I will

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.390 
very well very responsive and I will
pull<00:05:47.120> out<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.419> Xbox<00:05:47.990> original<00:05:48.800> one<00:05:48.979> so<00:05:49.340> you

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
pull out the Xbox original one so you

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.700 
pull out the Xbox original one so you
can<00:05:49.640> kind<00:05:49.910> of<00:05:49.970> see<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.210> difference<00:05:50.780> it<00:05:51.680> is

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
can kind of see a difference it is

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.730 
can kind of see a difference it is
slightly<00:05:52.220> taller<00:05:54.130> and<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:56.030> little<00:05:56.210> wider

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
slightly taller and it's a little wider

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.400 
slightly taller and it's a little wider
so<00:05:58.720> again<00:05:59.720> the<00:06:00.289> Xbox<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.950> is<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.130> little<00:06:01.280> fatter

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
so again the Xbox one is a little fatter

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.190 
so again the Xbox one is a little fatter
so<00:06:03.410> you're<00:06:03.740> not<00:06:03.860> really<00:06:04.789> sacrificing<00:06:05.479> much<00:06:05.900> on

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
so you're not really sacrificing much on

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.190 
so you're not really sacrificing much on
the<00:06:07.100> overall<00:06:07.700> design<00:06:08.090> of<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.419> except<00:06:08.990> for

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
the overall design of this except for

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.190 
the overall design of this except for
you<00:06:09.710> know<00:06:09.830> a<00:06:09.860> few<00:06:10.100> main<00:06:10.370> features<00:06:10.960> but<00:06:11.960> other
