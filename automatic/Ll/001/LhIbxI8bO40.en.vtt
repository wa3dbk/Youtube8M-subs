00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 on the rollover 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.390
 to connect your two bags in the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.390
 Office Tucker and put a needle in the middle 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.810
 so you do not touch the edge 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.740
 hurt grab the tongs and how the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.740
 ducks good one 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.960
 the special feature of a wallet 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.180
 tetrapacks she is so bright in total 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.830

 it's pretty nice to the rollover 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.740

 Here you are free round corners as well 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.100
 had to be possible is important to 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.760
 just an entry point, then 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.760
 a lax 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.930
 so that closes the wallet clean 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.159
 I recommend you the tabs as possible 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.530
 to center 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.950
 so the purse looks very pretty too 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.299

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.829
 even in an ash calls on loch 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.319
 fold the tab and draw the 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.760
 the place 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.680
 so you do not damage the inside 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.769

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.879
 in your wallet and then sat down with 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.879
