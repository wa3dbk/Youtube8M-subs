flash<00:00:48.899> vs.<00:00:49.440> Nightcrawler<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
flash vs. Nightcrawler I know in the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
flash vs. Nightcrawler I know in the
comics<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.510> flash<00:00:51.780> vs<00:00:52.260> Quicksilver<00:00:52.800> but

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
comics they did flash vs Quicksilver but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
comics they did flash vs Quicksilver but
flash<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> obviously<00:00:54.090> faster<00:00:54.300> than

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
flash is obviously faster than

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.189 
flash is obviously faster than
Quicksilver

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
Quicksilver

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.569 
Quicksilver
I<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.469> Nightcrawler<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> better

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I think Nightcrawler would be a better

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
I think Nightcrawler would be a better
match<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.300> instantaneous

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
match up because it's instantaneous

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
match up because it's instantaneous
anyway<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.500> game<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.859> incredibly<00:00:59.370> fun

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
anyway this game would be incredibly fun

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.389 
anyway this game would be incredibly fun

companies go against each other but no

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690 
companies go against each other but no
one<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.439> gets<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.920> chance<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
one really gets the chance to all the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
one really gets the chance to all the
way<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.420> quick<00:01:09.750> run<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.500> haven't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
way them at one quick run they haven't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
way them at one quick run they haven't
done<00:01:10.890> any<00:01:11.130> crossovers<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.150> while<00:01:12.360> between

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
done any crossovers in a while between

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
done any crossovers in a while between
the<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:12.960> universes<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.670> time

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the two universes and I think it's time

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
the two universes and I think it's time
for<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.570> Lego<00:01:15.930> Marvel<00:01:16.500> vs.<00:01:16.860> DC<00:01:16.890> game<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.770> don't
