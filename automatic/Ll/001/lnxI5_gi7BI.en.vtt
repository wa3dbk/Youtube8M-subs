00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.490 

almost<00:02:05.710> done

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650 

then<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.460> either<00:02:12.580> leave<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.270> horn<00:02:13.450> but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660

on<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:15.310> kind<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.790> cap<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.240> with<00:02:16.420> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
on and just kind of cap it with a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.430 
on and just kind of cap it with a
sideways<00:02:18.280> pressure<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.080> or<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.290> can

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
sideways pressure like this or you can

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.550 
sideways pressure like this or you can
remove<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.070> cap<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.880> we've<00:02:22.660> been<00:02:22.900> removing

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
the cap lately it seems to work a little

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.890 
the cap lately it seems to work a little
better<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.580> apply<00:02:27.940> put<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
better so apply put it over the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.070 
better so apply put it over the
remaining<00:02:29.560> horn<00:02:29.830> bud<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.510> apply<00:02:31.510> sideways

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
remaining horn bud and apply sideways

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:56.750 
remaining horn bud and apply sideways
pressure<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:54.489> wasn't<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:54.880> bad<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.390> yes

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
pressure that wasn't so bad was it yes

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:11.360 
pressure that wasn't so bad was it yes
my<00:02:57.760> teacher<00:02:58.150> will<00:02:58.450> help<00:02:58.840> her<00:02:58.989> heal<00:02:59.200> faster

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.830
