00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good people good today I bring you a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
 minecraft tutorial voucher that is going to be 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 the installation of a mod in mini craft 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.320
 force and good that this month in 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 what it does is to manage the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799
 different modes are valid so that they do not have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.120
 problems between them 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.130
 what it does is that they have better 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 compatibility when it is installed either 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.210
 different mods can already be the optimum or 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.250
 different plus several what it does is 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.529
 especially the forge is to administer 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.800
 the mods for the game to work well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 of minecraft and do not marry apart from that 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.780
 you can install many easily 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 thanks forge installing all the mods 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 in a folder that would be an installation 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360
 very easy then well let's see how it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.649
 install this to install this what 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 first thing you have to do is 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750
 download the mini craft force in this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.539
 link that I will leave in the description of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 video and well you download it and what 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 put in a folder as I have done 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.260
 here that I created a folder called 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.469
 minecraft fons 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 I would not go after the file, I'll go 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.479
 to do the forge for version 18 but 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100
 this tutorial also serves the method of 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.979
 installation for future under pressure and 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.940
 appears therefore future to pressures of the 18 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.130
 the 19 or those that are coming since the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.070
 installation method is the same as 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.159
 good is going to have it to install this is 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 double click or secondary button open with 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.950
 and the bonus with in java the program this one 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.920
 we get this we have here install 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 client this by the default route that 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 You have to install the minecraft and you give it 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 to accept the voucher, we are dropped 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.920
 some bookstores so that the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.920
 forging 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.240
 once you download the libraries 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.700
 we give here accept and would already install 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.160
 the forge so that it works perfectly 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.360
 ok we started it for the first time 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.300
 Minecraft 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.050
 and here it's worth then we select edit 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.619
 profile and we selected version 18 with 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.869
 Forge that would be this version 18 x with 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.550
 forge and we created the mod folder for 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.940
 to be able to install the different modes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.220
 we have here save profile puts here that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.120
 will start version 18 with forge and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.120
 we give to play 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.769
 here we see that we are unloaded 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.180
 forge files verify that everything is 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.180
 downloaded perfectly 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.690
 and it's like here we have the base 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.980
 183 motorcycles that are the three by default 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.660
 of forge with the here the three of forge 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.420
 and well, it would already be working 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.980
 perfectly we go to a player to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.910
 check that it works perfectly 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.910
