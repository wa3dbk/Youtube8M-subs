spinning flower onto the clouds and that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
spinning flower onto the clouds and that
might<00:00:42.570> take<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.200> time<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.710> practice

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
might take a little bit time to practice

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
might take a little bit time to practice
and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:44.879> line<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.440> way

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and then line up but that's the only way

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
and then line up but that's the only way
I<00:00:46.739> found<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.489> far<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I found to do it so far so we need to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
I found to do it so far so we need to
push<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.680> block<00:00:50.329> up<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> jump<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
push this block up so we can jump up the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.889 
push this block up so we can jump up the
little<00:00:54.000> tree<00:00:54.949> hopefully<00:00:55.949> without<00:00:56.070> falling

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
little tree hopefully without falling

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.990 
little tree hopefully without falling
now<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.620> fun<00:00:58.829> thing<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.640> chakra

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
now the fun thing about the chakra

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.639 
now the fun thing about the chakra
vehicle<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.750> actually<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.230> minigame

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
vehicle is that it's actually a minigame

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.009 
vehicle is that it's actually a minigame
now<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> achievement<00:01:03.510> you'll

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
now to get the achievement you'll

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
now to get the achievement you'll
actually<00:01:04.199> need<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> go<00:01:04.830> through<00:01:05.189> any<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually need to go through any of the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070 
actually need to go through any of the
minigame<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> talk<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
minigame you just need to talk to it and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.399 
minigame you just need to talk to it and
start<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.270> minigame<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.260> you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
start it but the minigame can take you

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.109 
start it but the minigame can take you
all<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.409> end<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> level<00:01:14.310> now

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
all the way to the end of the level now

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.789 
all the way to the end of the level now
what<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> need<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.960> avoid<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
what you need to do is avoid all the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
what you need to do is avoid all the
beat<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> need<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> avoid<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.259> them

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
beat and you need to avoid all of them

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
beat and you need to avoid all of them
coming<00:01:19.680> from<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.640> side<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.299> well<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
coming from the other side as well and

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.890 
coming from the other side as well and
so<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.729> hit<00:01:23.970> yet<00:01:24.270> knocked<00:01:24.479> off<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so if you get hit yet knocked off and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
so if you get hit yet knocked off and
depending<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.250> far<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> make<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> through

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
depending on how far you make it through

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
depending on how far you make it through
the<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.900> mini<00:01:28.080> game<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the little mini game you will get to a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
the little mini game you will get to a
different<00:01:30.030> checkpoint<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.960> because

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
different checkpoint you can see because

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.580 
different checkpoint you can see because
we<00:01:31.380> didn't<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.220> far<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:34.049> didn't<00:01:34.409> get

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
we didn't make it very far we didn't get

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.810 
we didn't make it very far we didn't get
very<00:01:35.400> far

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
very far

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.020 
very far
we<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.630> fact<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.640> nowhere<00:01:38.640> which<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we in fact when nowhere which is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
we in fact when nowhere which is
actually<00:01:39.600> beneficial<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.759> what's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
actually beneficial because what's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
actually beneficial because what's
really<00:01:42.240> annoying<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.560> far

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
really annoying is that if you get far

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
really annoying is that if you get far
enough<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> new<00:01:44.850> checkpoint<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.540> don't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
enough to get a new checkpoint but don't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
enough to get a new checkpoint but don't
get<00:01:45.990> towards<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> end<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> level<00:01:47.329> you'll

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
get towards the end of the level you'll

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
get towards the end of the level you'll
be<00:01:48.450> saved<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.960> checkpoint<00:01:49.229> meaning<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
be saved at that checkpoint meaning that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859

place let's be honest I mean if you get
the<00:01:58.860> checkpoint<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.670> before<00:02:00.090> the

the checkpoint just before the

the checkpoint just before the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
the whole deal with the arrow traps and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.240 
the whole deal with the arrow traps and
the<00:02:03.390> gone<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:04.260> gonna<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.800> bit<00:02:05.010> painful

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the gone that's gonna be a bit painful

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.990 
the gone that's gonna be a bit painful
but<00:02:06.080> if<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.230> die<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.770> quickly<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.430> can<00:02:08.610> go

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
but if you die really quickly you can go

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.450 
but if you die really quickly you can go
ahead<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.420> retry<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.770> best<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
ahead and retry it now the best way that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.520 
ahead and retry it now the best way that
I've<00:02:11.670> found<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> try<00:02:12.780> scram<00:02:13.200> as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I've found to do this is to try scram as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
I've found to do this is to try scram as
much<00:02:13.770> as<00:02:13.920> possible<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.820> obviously<00:02:15.420> try<00:02:15.960> see

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
much as possible and obviously try see

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.250 
much as possible and obviously try see
them<00:02:16.440> incoming<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.970> I'd<00:02:18.450> recommend<00:02:18.780> looking

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
them incoming now I'd recommend looking

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.610 
them incoming now I'd recommend looking
at<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.740> way<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:21.560> coming<00:02:22.560> from

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
at it this way because coming from

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.030 
at it this way because coming from
behind<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.870> view<00:02:25.320> all<00:02:25.740> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
behind in this this kind of view all of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
behind in this this kind of view all of
them<00:02:26.190> seem<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.520> group<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.940> which<00:02:27.300> means<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
them seem to group up which means if you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.810 
them seem to group up which means if you
constantly<00:02:28.380> move<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:29.340> chances<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> getting

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
constantly move the chances of getting

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.390 
constantly move the chances of getting
here<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.360> relatively<00:02:31.260> slim<00:02:31.500> whereas<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
here are relatively slim whereas the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.430 
here are relatively slim whereas the
ones<00:02:32.550> coming<00:02:32.760> from<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> front<00:02:33.390> are<00:02:34.260> all

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
ones coming from the front are all

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
ones coming from the front are all
spread<00:02:34.830> out<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> need<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.450> lot<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:37.220> kind<00:02:38.220> of

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
spread out and need a lot more kind of

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.250 
spread out and need a lot more kind of
coordination<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.600> where<00:02:39.750> they're<00:02:39.960> going

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
coordination for where they're going

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.020 
coordination for where they're going
compared<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.010> where<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> ones<00:02:41.550> from<00:02:41.730> behind

are<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> come<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.410> see<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.770> lot

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
are going to come from you can see a lot

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.660 
are going to come from you can see a lot
of<00:02:47.040> bubbles<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:47.580> well<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:49.250> hope<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.280> those

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
of bubbles as well now I hope that those

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.600 
of bubbles as well now I hope that those
bubbles<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.390> included<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
bubbles are not included in the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.310 
bubbles are not included in the
requirement<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.110> bubbles

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
requirement to get all the bubbles

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.590 
requirement to get all the bubbles
because<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.190> those<00:02:56.400> seem<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.390> really

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
because some of those seem really really

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.270 
because some of those seem really really
difficult<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.260> get<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.710> seriously<00:02:59.040> doubt

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
difficult to get and I seriously doubt

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.710 
difficult to get and I seriously doubt
you<00:02:59.430> could<00:02:59.580> get<00:02:59.730> all<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.150> these<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.630> are

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
you could get all of these that are

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.080 
you could get all of these that are
being<00:03:00.870> sane<00:03:04.550> also<00:03:05.550> looks<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.880> need<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
being sane also looks like you need to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.840 
being sane also looks like you need to
jump<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:06.600> I'm<00:03:06.750> scared<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> jumping<00:03:07.709> what<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:08.730> I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
jump but I'm scared of jumping what if I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
jump but I'm scared of jumping what if I
fall<00:03:08.910> off<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.260> can<00:03:10.380> see<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.830> it'll<00:03:11.100> drop

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
fall off so you can see that it'll drop

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.460 
fall off so you can see that it'll drop
you<00:03:11.430> right<00:03:11.550> next<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.420> boss<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:13.320> what's

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you right next to the boss now what's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.040 
you right next to the boss now what's
interesting<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.390> while<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.600> bring

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
interesting is that while you can bring

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.770 
interesting is that while you can bring
people<00:03:16.110> who<00:03:16.680> don't<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> push<00:03:17.780> ability

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
people who don't have the push ability

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
people who don't have the push ability
to<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.500> point<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.580> actually<00:03:20.730> continue

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to this point you can actually continue

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.430 
to this point you can actually continue
further<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.720> you're<00:03:21.840> still<00:03:22.080> in<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> group

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
because each one I each member will

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.210 
because each one I each member will
spawn<00:03:25.800> one<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:26.480> which<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:28.410> require<00:03:28.709> to

drop the bridge to actually get to the
