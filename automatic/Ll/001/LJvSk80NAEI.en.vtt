00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
one now this method will work with two

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
one now this method will work with two
schools<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.290> magic<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.189> basically<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.240> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
schools of magic so basically you have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
schools of magic so basically you have
unlimited<00:01:27.750> magical<00:01:28.560> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> two<00:01:29.220> schools<00:01:29.640> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
unlimited magical for the two schools of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
unlimited magical for the two schools of
your<00:01:30.119> choice<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:31.079> example<00:01:31.590> I'll<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.950> using

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
your choice for example I'll be using

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490 
your choice for example I'll be using
destruction<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.150> restoration<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> can

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
destruction and restoration so I can

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
destruction and restoration so I can
deal<00:01:34.740> damage<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.400> heal<00:01:35.700> myself<00:01:35.909> infinitely

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
deal damage and heal myself infinitely

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
deal damage and heal myself infinitely
but<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.740> another<00:01:37.950> school<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
but if you want to use another school of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
but if you want to use another school of
magic<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.060> choice<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
magic the choice is up to you I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
magic the choice is up to you I
recommend<00:01:40.950> doing<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.670> destruction<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
recommend doing it for destruction and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
recommend doing it for destruction and
restoration<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:43.649> probably<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> most

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
restoration as these probably the most

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
restoration as these probably the most
commonly<00:01:44.820> used<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.659> need<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> find<00:01:46.200> some

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
