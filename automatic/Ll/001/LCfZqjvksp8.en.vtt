00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.100
 the picture quality 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.539
 as a picture sensor comes in the pentax mx 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.060
 1 1 to 17 inches big c mos sensor with 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.789
 12 megapixel resolution for use 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.919
 This size has to be in combination with 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.960
 a moderate resolution as a guarantee for 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.480
 a good picture quality in a compact camera 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.180
 segment exposed at the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.700
 image quality belongs to the pentax mx1 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.309
 the best models at 1 to 17 inches 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.610
 large sensor at low iso values 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.989
 So iso 100 iso 200 is almost knows 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.150
 image noise present the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.340
 Detail rendering is very good too 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.110
 iso 400 there is nothing to complain about 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 details will continue to be very good 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.030
 iso 800 is then a first 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.590
 easy waste recognizable being 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.170
 this absolutely limits 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.970
 with iso 1600 the image noise increases 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.189
 then visible to the detail rendering 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.280
 falls significantly with restrictions 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.189
 but are also iso 1600 still usable 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.810
 about iso 1600 details only 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.149
 Badly given back the textures 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.510
 work muddy only in case of emergency can 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.450
 iso value of 3200 still to be used 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.310
 the good result of the pentax mx1 has 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.230
 even with less light ago existed here 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.260
 the detail playback moves to iso 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.430
 400 on a good and up to 800 iso 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.440
 at an acceptable level 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060
 Details about this become clear 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.680
 worse resolved and that too 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.680
 Image noise is no longer to be overlooked 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.810
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.620
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 the camera point de 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
 was in this way 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.840
 equal they have the possibility to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.619
 shown image sections interactively too 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.659
 to compare 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.760
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.619
 specify if available an objective 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.530
 choose and the pictures in different 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.780
 compare situations 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.940
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.400
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.860
 or if fronts pipe as well as the iso 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.690
 sensitivity 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.610
 in addition to different camera models 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 You can also do a certain 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.240
 model with different 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.680
 compare settings 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.310
 In this example we show the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 6400 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.980
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.980
 Recordings by day and night
