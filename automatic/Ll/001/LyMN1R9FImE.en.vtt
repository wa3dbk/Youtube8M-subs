now normally if the cross fader is that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
now normally if the cross fader is that
way<00:00:44.070> you're<00:00:44.370> gonna<00:00:44.460> hear<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.910> Dec<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.420> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
when you reverse it that would mean that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
when you reverse it that would mean that
if<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> cross<00:00:50.129> fader<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.969> side<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
if the cross fader is on this side you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
if the cross fader is on this side you
hear<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.840> Dec<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> side

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you hear this deck now that might be a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
you hear this deck now that might be a
bit<00:00:57.090> confusing<00:00:57.539> why<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> do

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
bit confusing why would you want to do

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
bit confusing why would you want to do
that<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.520> scratching<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> not

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that but this is for scratching it's not

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
that but this is for scratching it's not
really<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.960> mixing<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.590> mean<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:01.859> know

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
really for mixing I mean I even know

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
really for mixing I mean I even know
some<00:01:02.399> DJ's<00:01:02.699> who<00:01:02.879> mix<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.920> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
some DJ's who mix like that but that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
some DJ's who mix like that but that
makes<00:01:05.129> no<00:01:05.339> sense<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:07.200> scratching

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
makes no sense to me but for scratching

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
makes no sense to me but for scratching
I<00:01:07.830> understand<00:01:08.369> where<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.580> comes<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.939> because

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I understand where it comes from because

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.539 
I understand where it comes from because
if<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> basic<00:01:10.890> scratches<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> lot

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
if you look at the basic scratches a lot

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
if you look at the basic scratches a lot
of<00:01:11.790> basic<00:01:12.090> scratches<00:01:12.360> start<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.040> cross

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
of basic scratches start with your cross

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.060 
of basic scratches start with your cross
fader<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> closed<00:01:15.030> position<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.920> then<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
fader in a closed position and then you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.999 
fader in a closed position and then you
open<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> begin<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.380> scratch<00:01:19.680> when

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
open it when you begin your scratch when

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
open it when you begin your scratch when
you<00:01:20.130> do<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.430> scratch<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you do your scratch with some of the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
you do your scratch with some of the
more<00:01:21.990> advanced<00:01:22.320> scratches<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> flare

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
more advanced scratches like a flare

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
more advanced scratches like a flare
scratch<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.880> instance<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> start<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.750> your

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
scratch for instance you start with your

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
scratch for instance you start with your
cross<00:01:25.020> fader<00:01:25.259> open<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.640> about

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
cross fader open and it's all about

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
cross fader open and it's all about
closing<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> start<00:01:28.890> your<00:01:29.070> scratch

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
closing it when you start your scratch

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.289 
closing it when you start your scratch
so<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.689> different<00:01:31.140> feeling<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.970> some

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so it's a different feeling and for some

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.050 
so it's a different feeling and for some
DJ's<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.409> feels<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:35.009> natural<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
DJ's that feels more natural when the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
DJ's that feels more natural when the
cross<00:01:36.270> fader<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.750> reversed<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.579> definitely

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
cross fader is reversed and I definitely

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.219 
cross fader is reversed and I definitely
understand<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.479> comes<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.780> because

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
understand where that comes from because

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
understand where that comes from because
with<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> scratch<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.729> feel<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
with that scratch I could feel it that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.380 
with that scratch I could feel it that
it<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.810> beginning<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.320> felt<00:01:43.770> easier<00:01:44.390> when

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it in the beginning if felt easier when

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
it in the beginning if felt easier when
it<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.750> Reverse<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.829> decided<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.430> stick

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it was in Reverse but I decided to stick

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
it was in Reverse but I decided to stick
with<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> normal<00:01:48.270> style<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> did<00:01:49.649> not

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
with the normal style because I did not

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
with the normal style because I did not
want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.670> other<00:01:50.880> scratches<00:01:51.450> with

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
want to do all my other scratches with

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.510 
want to do all my other scratches with
the<00:01:51.960> reverse<00:01:52.290> cross<00:01:52.590> fader<00:01:52.829> setting<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the reverse cross fader setting I just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.980 
the reverse cross fader setting I just
didn't<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> feeling<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> didn't<00:01:54.840> feel

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
didn't like the feeling it didn't feel

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.340 
didn't like the feeling it didn't feel
natural<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.560> me<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.270> why<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
natural to me but that's why they do it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
natural to me but that's why they do it
so<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> decide<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.880> yourself<00:02:00.240> by

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so you have to decide for yourself by

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
so you have to decide for yourself by
trying<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:00.990> especially<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> more

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
trying it out especially with the more

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.510 
trying it out especially with the more
advanced<00:02:02.549> scratches<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.710> feels<00:02:04.979> better

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
advanced scratches if it feels better

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.700 
advanced scratches if it feels better
for<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> lot<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.469> these<00:02:07.560> guys

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
for you because what a lot of these guys

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
for you because what a lot of these guys
do<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.190> will<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.550> their<00:02:08.759> cross<00:02:09.179> fader

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
do they will have their cross fader

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080 
do they will have their cross fader
normal<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:11.039> they're<00:02:11.190> mixing<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.790> when<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
normal when they're mixing and when it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.880 
normal when they're mixing and when it's
time<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.480> some

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
time to do some

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.220 
time to do some
they<00:02:13.280> will<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.640> switch<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.180> hamster<00:02:14.990> style

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
they will just switch to hamster style

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.010 
they will just switch to hamster style
and<00:02:15.550> do<00:02:16.550> their<00:02:16.700> scratches<00:02:17.240> because<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:17.990> in

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
and do their scratches because back in

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.660 
and do their scratches because back in
the<00:02:18.170> days<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.350> didn't<00:02:18.800> have<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:18.980> setting<00:02:19.520> on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the days you didn't have that setting on

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.580 
the days you didn't have that setting on
mixers<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> now<00:02:20.420> most<00:02:20.720> mixers<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.380> just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
mixers and now most mixers will just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.050 
mixers and now most mixers will just
have<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> little<00:02:22.069> button<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.340> says<00:02:22.700> reverse

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
have a little button that says reverse

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.630 
have a little button that says reverse
so<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.690> switch<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:23.990> or<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> pioneer

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
so you can switch it or on the pioneer

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.640 
so you can switch it or on the pioneer
mixes<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.030> club<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.600> dedicate<00:02:27.410> each

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
mixes in the club you can dedicate each

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
mixes in the club you can dedicate each
channel<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> side<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.510> crossfader<00:02:30.050> so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
channel to a side of the crossfader so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
channel to a side of the crossfader so
it's<00:02:30.410> very<00:02:30.500> easy<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:31.070> pick<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.850> do<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.600> in

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
it's very easy to pick it do it in

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.380 
it's very easy to pick it do it in
normal<00:02:32.930> or<00:02:33.290> set<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.680> as<00:02:33.800> reverse<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.459> back<00:02:35.240> in

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
normal or set it as reverse and back in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.730 
normal or set it as reverse and back in
the<00:02:35.450> days<00:02:35.600> before<00:02:35.780> they<00:02:36.110> had<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.440> they<00:02:36.590> had

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
the days before they had that they had

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.500 
the days before they had that they had
to<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.040> switch<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.459> turntables<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.180> Reverse

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to just switch the turntables in Reverse

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.240 
to just switch the turntables in Reverse
put<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:38.989> back<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> left<00:02:39.650> side<00:02:39.860> left

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
put the right back in the left side left

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
put the right back in the left side left
deck<00:02:40.489> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> right<00:02:40.880> side<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.780> reach<00:02:42.050> that

alright guys so here's my mixer and
right<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.700> normal<00:02:50.150> setting<00:02:50.390> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
right now it's in a normal setting that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.680 
right now it's in a normal setting that
I<00:02:50.630> always<00:02:50.959> use<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.530> with<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.769> Pioneer<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.340> can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
I always use so with the Pioneer you can

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
I always use so with the Pioneer you can
assign<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:53.989> channels<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.709> certain<00:02:55.070> side

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
assign your channels to a certain side

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.680 
assign your channels to a certain side
of<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.459> fader<00:02:55.700> or<00:02:55.940> don't<00:02:56.180> assign<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.570> the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
of the fader or don't assign it to the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.660 
of the fader or don't assign it to the
crossfader<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.290> all<00:02:57.500> I'm<00:02:57.890> using<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.340> 2<00:02:58.489> middle

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
crossfader at all I'm using the 2 middle

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.729 
crossfader at all I'm using the 2 middle
channels<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.300> now<00:02:59.510> so<00:02:59.840> my<00:03:00.019> right<00:03:00.320> channel

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
channels right now so my right channel

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.440 
channels right now so my right channel
goes<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> right<00:03:01.880> side<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.239> cross

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
goes to the right side of the cross

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
goes to the right side of the cross
fader<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.959> my<00:03:03.140> left<00:03:03.410> channel<00:03:03.620> goes<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.100> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
fader and my left channel goes to the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.460 
fader and my left channel goes to the
left<00:03:04.430> side<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.760> cross<00:03:04.940> fader<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
left side of the cross fader so to the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.790 
left side of the cross fader so to the
right<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:07.269> can<00:03:08.269> hear<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.600> one<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.050> now<00:03:09.769> I

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the left I can hear my left turntable

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.900 
the left I can hear my left turntable
and<00:03:14.840> now<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.110> can<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.920> with<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.550> lot<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
and now I can and with a lot of the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.670 
and now I can and with a lot of the
normal<00:03:17.269> scratches<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.840> start<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.470> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
normal scratches you start in that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.250 
normal scratches you start in that
closed<00:03:18.980> position<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.329> open<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.019> hear

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
closed position and you open it to hear

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:33.340 
closed position and you open it to hear
this<00:03:21.380> sound<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.970> side<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:32.450> was<00:03:32.870> used<00:03:33.170> to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
this sound on that side so I was used to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.920 
this sound on that side so I was used to
that<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:34.190> then<00:03:34.730> came<00:03:35.090> for<00:03:35.540> instance<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
that but then came for instance the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.600 
that but then came for instance the
flare<00:03:36.170> scratch<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.769> like<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.040> explained<00:03:37.430> with

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
flare scratch and like I explained with

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.009 
flare scratch and like I explained with
the<00:03:37.640> flare<00:03:37.850> scratch<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.299> don't<00:03:38.570> start<00:03:38.959> with

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
the flare scratch you don't start with

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.990 
the flare scratch you don't start with
the<00:03:39.200> fate<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.380> clothes<00:03:39.769> so<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.430> have<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:40.760> start

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
the fate of clothes so you have to start

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.870 
the fate of clothes so you have to start
with<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.209> fader<00:03:41.390> open<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.340> move<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.549> record

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
with the fader open and move the record

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.449 
with the fader open and move the record
and<00:03:44.060> then<00:03:44.329> close<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.750> open<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.560> close<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.100> open

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
and then close it open it close it open

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.569 
and then close it open it close it open
it<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.079> different<00:03:48.680> movement<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.549> you

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
it so it's a different movement if you

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.539 
it so it's a different movement if you
used<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.090> starting<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.870> position<00:03:51.220> now<00:03:52.220> it

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
used to starting in that position now it

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.060 
used to starting in that position now it
worked<00:03:53.120> ok<00:03:53.510> for<00:03:53.690> me<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.079> on<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.650> right<00:03:54.829> side

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
worked ok for me on on the right side

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:04.690 
worked ok for me on on the right side
with<00:03:55.250> my<00:03:55.370> left<00:03:55.579> hand<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> faded<00:03:56.180> I<00:04:03.610> can<00:04:04.610> do

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
with my left hand on the faded I can do

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.759 
with my left hand on the faded I can do
that<00:04:04.820> one<00:04:05.030> click<00:04:05.239> flare<00:04:05.480> or<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.930> two<00:04:06.140> click<00:04:06.350> it

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
that one click flare or the two click it

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.490 
that one click flare or the two click it
will<00:04:06.920> work<00:04:07.160> but<00:04:07.970> I'm<00:04:08.239> not<00:04:08.510> ambidextrous<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.320> I

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
will work but I'm not ambidextrous and I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.710 
will work but I'm not ambidextrous and I
can<00:04:09.709> do<00:04:09.859> every<00:04:10.100> scratch<00:04:10.370> on<00:04:10.579> both<00:04:10.910> sides<00:04:11.390> I

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
can do every scratch on both sides I

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.360 
can do every scratch on both sides I
don't<00:04:12.260> have<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> same<00:04:12.680> feeling<00:04:13.100> in<00:04:13.220> both

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
don't have the same feeling in both

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.150 
don't have the same feeling in both
hands<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.209> when<00:04:14.870> my<00:04:14.989> right<00:04:15.290> hand<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.799> actually

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
hands so when my right hand is actually

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
to the fader hand that hand is not good

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.250 
to the fader hand that hand is not good
for<00:04:19.039> every<00:04:19.280> scratch<00:04:19.609> because<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.690> works<00:04:20.959> fine

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
for every scratch because it works fine

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.529 
for every scratch because it works fine
for<00:04:21.320> transform<00:04:22.310> scratches<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:22.970> normal<00:04:23.300> cuts

now<00:04:47.660> now<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.870> can't<00:04:48.410> get<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.770> work<00:04:48.920> if<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:49.220> do

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
now now I can't get it to work if I do

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.920 
now now I can't get it to work if I do
this<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:49.790> three<00:04:50.120> four<00:04:50.360> or<00:04:50.420> five<00:04:50.480> minutes

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
this for like three four or five minutes

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.260 
this for like three four or five minutes
in<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.080> row<00:04:51.260> then<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.250> feeling<00:04:52.640> starts<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:53.090> come

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
in a row then the feeling starts to come

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.930 
in a row then the feeling starts to come
back<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.690> can<00:04:53.870> do<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.080> for<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.710> while<00:04:55.190> but

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
back and I can do it for a while but

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.340 
back and I can do it for a while but
that's<00:04:56.120> not<00:04:56.300> gonna<00:04:56.450> help<00:04:56.600> me<00:04:56.720> out<00:04:56.840> when<00:04:57.230> I'm

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
that's not gonna help me out when I'm

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.770 
that's not gonna help me out when I'm
doing<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:57.770> scratch<00:04:58.160> session<00:04:58.730> so<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.270> still<00:04:59.630> have

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
doing a scratch session so I still have

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.120 
doing a scratch session so I still have
to<00:04:59.810> practice<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.350> like<00:05:00.650> crazy

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
to practice that like crazy

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.450 
to practice that like crazy
but<00:05:01.669> because<00:05:02.060> my<00:05:02.210> hand<00:05:02.480> is<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.810> used<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.460> moving

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
but because my hand is so used to moving

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.770 
but because my hand is so used to moving
in<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:05.060> position<00:05:05.360> if<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.950> reverse<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.640> now

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
in that position if I reverse it now

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.200 
in that position if I reverse it now
right<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:08.960> reversed<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:09.830> now<00:05:10.040> this<00:05:11.030> is

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
right now I reversed it so now this is

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.320 
right now I reversed it so now this is
closed<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.680> side<00:05:12.919> is<00:05:12.950> open<00:05:13.310> now<00:05:14.090> it

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
Reverse could actually help me out but

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.409 
Reverse could actually help me out but
if<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.460> want<00:05:40.640> to<00:05:40.700> go<00:05:40.790> back<00:05:41.000> to<00:05:41.150> your<00:05:41.270> normal

if you want to go back to your normal

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.409 
if you want to go back to your normal
transform<00:05:42.640> that's<00:05:43.640> not<00:05:43.850> gonna<00:05:44.030> work<00:05:44.270> in

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
transform that's not gonna work in

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.570 
transform that's not gonna work in
Reverse<00:05:44.720> because<00:05:45.140> now<00:05:45.440> it's<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.130> opposite

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
Reverse because now it's in the opposite

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.219 
Reverse because now it's in the opposite
direction<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:47.150> I'd<00:05:47.270> have<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.630> switch<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.900> back

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
direction and I'd have to switch it back

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.020 
direction and I'd have to switch it back
I<00:05:48.410> don't<00:05:48.440> want<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:48.830> go<00:05:48.919> to<00:05:48.979> that<00:05:49.220> trouble<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:50.000> I

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
I don't want to go to that trouble so I

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.730 
I don't want to go to that trouble so I
just<00:05:50.270> keep<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:50.750> normal<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.229> I'll<00:05:51.410> have<00:05:51.590> to

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
just keep it and normal and I'll have to

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.950 
just keep it and normal and I'll have to
practice<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.460> Flair<00:05:52.729> scratch<00:05:53.090> until<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.750> get

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
practice that Flair scratch until I get

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.740 
practice that Flair scratch until I get
it<00:05:54.050> right<00:05:54.260> in<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.650> normal<00:05:55.040> setting<00:05:55.460> so<00:05:56.150> I<00:05:56.479> hope

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.600
