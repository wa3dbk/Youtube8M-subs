this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.070> decided<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> build<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.300> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this is what I've decided to build so as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
this is what I've decided to build so as
you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> screen<00:00:37.020> we've<00:00:37.710> got<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you can see on the screen we've got a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.310 
you can see on the screen we've got a
pretty<00:00:38.280> decent<00:00:38.430> team<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> may<00:00:39.300> notice<00:00:39.329> as

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pretty decent team now you may notice as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
pretty decent team now you may notice as
well<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.890> Tiote<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.969> 8<00:00:42.180> chemistry

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
well that Tiote here is on 8 chemistry

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.590 
well that Tiote here is on 8 chemistry
but<00:00:42.960> his<00:00:43.110> natural<00:00:43.440> position<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.190> CDM<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
but his natural position is a CDM and I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
but his natural position is a CDM and I
decided<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> use<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.129> position<00:00:47.879> card<00:00:48.120> on

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
decided not to use a position card on

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
decided not to use a position card on
him<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> also<00:00:49.920> play<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.280> team

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
him and but you can also play this team

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
him and but you can also play this team
in<00:00:50.899> 442<00:00:51.899> number<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.010> Rome<00:00:53.280> Eric

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
in 442 number two and then Rome Eric

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.450 
in 442 number two and then Rome Eric
here<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.629> loses<00:00:55.230> his<00:00:55.469> 9<00:00:55.739> chemistry<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.340> it's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
here also loses his 9 chemistry so it's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
here also loses his 9 chemistry so it's
really<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
really down to you what you want to do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
really down to you what you want to do
with<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> loyalty<00:00:59.039> trade<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.640> players

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
with the loyalty trade these two players

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
with the loyalty trade these two players
will<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> online<00:01:00.329> chemistry<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.219> far<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
will be online chemistry but so far this

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
will be online chemistry but so far this
thing's<00:01:02.789> pretty<00:01:02.969> good<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.420> bias<00:01:04.170> drop<00:01:04.439> over

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
thing's pretty good also bias drop over

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
thing's pretty good also bias drop over
here<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> normally<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:06.150> wing<00:01:06.450> he's<00:01:06.659> been

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
here is normally a right wing he's been

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.179 
here is normally a right wing he's been
moved<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.380> mid<00:01:07.590> position<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
moved to the right mid position so that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
moved to the right mid position so that
does<00:01:08.490> increase<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> price<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.049> team<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
does increase the price of this team a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.219 
does increase the price of this team a
little<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.610> yes<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
little bit so I'm it's yes it's the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
little bit so I'm it's yes it's the
overall<00:01:13.500> cost<00:01:13.680> I've<00:01:13.950> paid<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> these

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
overall cost I've paid for all of these

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120 
overall cost I've paid for all of these
players<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.270> together<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.799> 7900<00:01:16.799> Cuenco

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
players put together is 7900 Cuenco

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
players put together is 7900 Cuenco
let's<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.460> round<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> place<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:18.810> we've

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
let's go round all of the place so we've

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679 
let's go round all of the place so we've
got<00:01:19.140> goalkeeper<00:01:19.799> got<00:01:19.979> ruddy<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.700> he's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
got goalkeeper got ruddy here and he's

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
got goalkeeper got ruddy here and he's
from<00:01:21.810> Norwich<00:01:22.170> he's<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> strong

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
from Norwich he's gonna get the strong

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
from Norwich he's gonna get the strong
link<00:01:23.310> with<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.000> song<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:24.930> it's

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
that's how you played his team ready but

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.980 
that's how you played his team ready but
here<00:05:18.970> going<00:05:19.970> through<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.330> so<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:20.660> good<00:05:20.810> plays

over the top born for some reason his

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.580 
over the top born for some reason his
goalkeeper<00:05:23.660> comes<00:05:23.870> out<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.110> think<00:05:24.230> he<00:05:24.320> kind<00:05:24.530> of

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.100 
in 82nd minute don't think it really
cared<00:05:28.100> but<00:05:28.850> that's<00:05:29.030> gonna<00:05:29.210> get<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.720> goal<00:05:29.930> for
