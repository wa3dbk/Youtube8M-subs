00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.279
 we are at a crossroads 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.300
 yes vali you really have nothing to do here he 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.810
 will accelerate 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.169
 and at the traffic lights a red light line 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:36.520
 to brake and go only when 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:40.359
 Uncle Kuzi ’s green light stops and 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.420
 people go out and near all the cars too 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:47.469
 stopped want him green light 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.949
 why is it burning drivers 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.510
 obey the rules of the road 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.420
 which are created to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.960
 car and public transport and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.199
 pedestrians did not interfere with each other 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.290
 no knowledge of these rules 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.479
 the driver behind the wheel does not sit sorry only 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.130
 that these exams are not invented for 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.740
 pedestrians easily passed such an exam 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.170
 pedestrians can cross the street only 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.009
 green light 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.450
 that's when red lights on the road 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.619
 can not go 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 true yes even remember even if it burns 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 green light first look to the left 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.070
 then to the right is there any going 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.100
 the driver slobs and only then 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.140
 start crossing the road yourself 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.719
 ever get behind the wheel remember 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.880
 normal driver should always 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.049
 give way to pedestrians and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.960
 public transport by tram 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.439
 bus trolley ok i'm all this 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.100
 I'll remember it will be useful just 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.100
 for sure 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.340
 Uncle Kuzi and why the tram goes on 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.640
 rails 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 they are on the road remember our first 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.640
 travel i talked about conga 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.050
 then it was a very comfortable look 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 urban transport 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.140
 Over time, people abandoned the horses and 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.319
 on the already laid rails allowed 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.200
 tram transport with electric motor 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.350
 that is, the engine that runs on 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.110
 electricity is true for supplying this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.760
 electricity to the engine had to be over 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.860
 rails stretch wires than a tram 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.590
 from above such a thing outside is hooked 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.600
 correct to call her rod similar 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.290
 rod connects with wires and 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 trolley bus though he doesn't need rails 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.630
 equally uncomfortable cars and buses there 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.730
 go by trolleybus only where about bob 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.790
 chevostik electric transport is good 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.180
 those that do not harm the environment 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.010
 does not pollute it like cars 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.920
 car that pollute before the car 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.930
 poison the air with exhaust fumes 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 remember i explained how it works 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.790
 internal combustion engine and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.500
 formed which moves the wheels 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.620
 correctly remembered but after 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.840
 Gaspra does his job in the engine 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.280
 need to serve a new batch of fuel 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.950
 so that the motor continues to work which 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.530
 this exhaust gas has already turned out 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.859
 removed from the engine through the exhaust 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.579
 the pipe which is located at the car 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.950
 behind here it turns out why of the cars 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:02.030
 there is no smoke behind it 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.390
 and exhaust gases unfortunately these gases 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.120
 dangerous to our health are people who 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.340
 breathe polluted air more often sick 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.610
 then the inventor is right chevostik 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.450
 it's time to topic 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.050
 I do that gasoline from oil oh ё on 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.030
 our planet is getting smaller 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:29.440
 because of this, gasoline is becoming more expensive 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.490
 and grow more expensive 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.120
 I would have thought of such a car without 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.050
 gari 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.920
 without dust without noise without electricity 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.800
 could drive was fast and useful 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.700
 it was think baby people you for it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.000
 thanks will say and now it's time for you and me 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.000
 home turn off time skok
