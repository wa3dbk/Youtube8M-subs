 unboxing of ipad 4 ipad number 4 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.699
 and teach you here of 16 gigabytes the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.610
 The only difference is that you can not 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:02.379
 appreciate here it comes with lighting 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.159
 connector for usb and good your elders 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.110
 changes are in as the processor and 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.830
 supposedly the retina display that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.770
 comes now in this is very much improved 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.560
 with respect to ipad 3 and good if not 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.930
 talk a lot we are going to open it here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.130
 in this product of the ipad I do not like 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.130
 damage the meat a lot 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 but here carefully 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.690
 It really is not 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.610
 a product that many people did not expect 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.010
 but 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.190
 see when you do the review its 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.460
 processor improvements 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.610
 and to see how well let's see 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.610
 bring this ipad 4 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 as you can see is the blank purchase 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.720
 and if it feels a little bit heavier than 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.670
 the ipad 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.810
 you feel a little bit the difference to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.120
 put him aside here 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.580
 well here you can see the connector as 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.500
 everyone 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.500
 you know for the current 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.820
 and its usb connector here 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.590
 this little box 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.600
 of what it is like a quick explanation 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.600
 where does he turn it on 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.460
 we explain a month where he extracts the camera 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.190
 cast 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.140
 and his decals as I always do and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.650
 information 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.230
 the user enters from nothing 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.230
 and the new connector 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.680
 in lighting calling the line he does not 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.380
 You can connect in any way to 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.440
 forward usb and 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.430
 I do not work the fons I thought I was going to bring 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:20.140
 one etc a few headphones but I do not work 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.140
 with this here to the side 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.570
 direct 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.560
 4 with its improvements all the exterior 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.780
 and everything you can see equal to ipad 3 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.380
 the only improvement they say is in the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.380
 processor 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.470
 to 6 if I'm not wrong 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.840
 the same after your front camera records 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.840
 1080 videos 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.650
 and anyway in his in his 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.290
 review I will explain 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.660
 what is the difference between ipad 3 and 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.020
 this ipad 4 we are going to learn 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.240
 a moment to see 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.550
 you see I do not know if you could appreciate 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:17.049
 a little bit the retina display 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.870
 and good as everything you have to configure the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.010
 but hey this is the unboxing of the ipad 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.400
 number 4 if it feels a bit heavy 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.890
 and here I am going to show you the connector 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.390
 line as you can see that on your part 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.920
 exterior is the newest 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.140
 what he brings 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.880
 and the outside has been very 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.710
 totally the same could I say with 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.129
 regarding ipad 3 only in its part 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.709
 outside would change the line connector 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.259
 and well in your review I 'm going to talk 

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:55.649
 about the processor that is so fast the 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.149
 seat as you can see its volume for 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:00.380
 lock the screen on the button 

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:06.860
 lit camera without 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:08.630
 flash and good I'll make a better video 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.790

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.910

 hit phone I thought it came with a few 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.290
 hearing aids but good 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.639
