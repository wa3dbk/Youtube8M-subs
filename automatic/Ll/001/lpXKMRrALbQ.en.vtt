00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
going to talk about loudspeakers as

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.040 
going to talk about loudspeakers as
bandpass<00:00:17.630> devices<00:00:18.439> we'll<00:00:19.340> start<00:00:19.610> with<00:00:19.730> just

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
bandpass devices we'll start with just

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.900 
bandpass devices we'll start with just
drawing<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.170> line<00:00:21.350> graph<00:00:21.619> on<00:00:21.890> our<00:00:22.010> whiteboard

drawing a line graph on our whiteboard

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.909 
drawing a line graph on our whiteboard
here<00:00:23.320> that<00:00:24.320> represents<00:00:24.890> frequency<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:27.800> we

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
here that represents frequency that we

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.900 
here that represents frequency that we
measured<00:00:28.279> in<00:00:28.869> hertz<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.759> loudspeakers<00:00:31.759> we

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
measured in hertz so loudspeakers we

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.930 
measured in hertz so loudspeakers we
know<00:00:32.060> can<00:00:32.599> produce<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.930> range<00:00:33.200> of<00:00:33.440> route<00:00:33.650> of

describe loudspeakers or systems and try

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.110 
describe loudspeakers or systems and try
to<00:00:59.690> put<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.649> on<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.829> board<00:01:01.010> what<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:01.940> when

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
to put it on the board what is it when

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.439 
to put it on the board what is it when
we<00:01:02.870> talk<00:01:03.079> about<00:01:03.109> a<00:01:03.589> subwoofer<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.820> start<00:01:05.089> a

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
we talk about a subwoofer to start a

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.130 
we talk about a subwoofer to start a
subwoofer<00:01:06.400> well<00:01:07.400> produce<00:01:07.990> range<00:01:08.990> of

subwoofer well produce range of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.440 
subwoofer well produce range of
frequencies<00:01:09.620> in<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.070> zone<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.490> 30<00:01:11.180> Hertz

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
frequencies in the zone of 30 Hertz

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.100 
frequencies in the zone of 30 Hertz
through<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.080> 80<00:01:12.470> Hertz<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.010> very<00:01:13.520> typical

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
through to 80 Hertz is a very typical

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.290 
through to 80 Hertz is a very typical
expectation<00:01:15.110> for<00:01:15.290> subwoofers<00:01:16.030> then<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.120> have

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
expectation for subwoofers then we have

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.140 
expectation for subwoofers then we have
our<00:01:17.570> woofers<00:01:18.520> usually<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.670> 50<00:01:19.970> Hertz

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150

even<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.440> bit<00:01:45.620> lower<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.190> they'll<00:01:46.670> play<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.910> 16

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
even a bit lower and they'll play to 16

or 18 or 20 kilohertz depending on so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.020 
or 18 or 20 kilohertz depending on so
let's<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.100> look<00:01:52.340> at<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.550> units<00:01:52.880> on

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
let's just have a look at the units on

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.240 
let's just have a look at the units on
the<00:01:53.180> table<00:01:53.540> here<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.250> representation

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
the table here this is a representation

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.160 
the table here this is a representation
of<00:01:55.370> some<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.880> models<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.300> 18<00:01:56.930> sound

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
of some of the models that 18 sound

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.440 
of some of the models that 18 sound
manufacturer<00:01:57.940> starting<00:01:58.940> down<00:01:59.060> here<00:01:59.270> at<00:01:59.360> the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
manufacturer starting down here at the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.070 
manufacturer starting down here at the
big<00:01:59.600> guys<00:01:59.810> we've<00:02:00.770> got<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.980> 21<00:02:01.490> inch<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.970> an<00:02:02.690> 18

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
big guys we've got a 21 inch and an 18

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.580 
big guys we've got a 21 inch and an 18
inch<00:02:03.610> sub<00:02:04.610> woofer<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.120> are<00:02:05.930> typically<00:02:06.380> used

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
inch sub woofer that are typically used

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.740 
inch sub woofer that are typically used
in<00:02:06.770> systems<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.280> play<00:02:07.550> from<00:02:07.790> 30<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.239> 80<00:02:08.420> Hertz

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
in systems to play from 30 to 80 Hertz

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.990 
in systems to play from 30 to 80 Hertz
then<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> woofer<00:02:10.250> range<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:11.239> got<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> 15<00:02:11.900> 12

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
then for a woofer range you got a 15 12

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.119 
then for a woofer range you got a 15 12
you<00:02:14.000> might<00:02:14.180> even<00:02:14.360> use<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.140> 10<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> woofer

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
you might even use the 10 in the woofer

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.670 
you might even use the 10 in the woofer
range<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.150> we're<00:02:17.269> going<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.480> play<00:02:17.660> from<00:02:17.960> 50<00:02:18.590> or

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
range so we're going to play from 50 or

1,200<00:02:23.090> Hertz<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.930> therefore<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> mid-range

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
1,200 Hertz and therefore a mid-range

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.540 
1,200 Hertz and therefore a mid-range
here's<00:02:25.580> an<00:02:25.790> example<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.480> an<00:02:26.570> 8<00:02:26.720> inch<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:28.310> 6

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
here's an example of an 8 inch and a 6

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450 
here's an example of an 8 inch and a 6
inch<00:02:28.810> that's<00:02:29.810> playing<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.350> 100<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.340> 200

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
inch that's playing in the 100 and 200

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.330 
inch that's playing in the 100 and 200
Hertz<00:02:31.880> range<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.390> out<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.080> 2<00:02:33.740> or<00:02:33.920> 3<00:02:34.130> K

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
Hertz range and out to 2 or 3 K

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.940 
Hertz range and out to 2 or 3 K
sometimes<00:02:35.120> even<00:02:35.450> higher<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.960> then<00:02:36.560> finally

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
sometimes even higher and then finally

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190 
sometimes even higher and then finally
for<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.220> compression<00:02:37.760> driver<00:02:37.880> range<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:39.050> have<00:02:39.080> a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
for a compression driver range we have a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
for a compression driver range we have a
series<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:39.830> different<00:02:40.100> compression<00:02:40.550> drivers

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
series of different compression drivers

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.160 
series of different compression drivers
that<00:02:41.240> are<00:02:41.300> always<00:02:41.570> attached<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.260> horns<00:02:43.030> so

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that are always attached to horns so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.190 
that are always attached to horns so
there<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.320> bandwidth<00:02:46.180> devices<00:02:47.200> various

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
there it is bandwidth devices various

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.530 
there it is bandwidth devices various
sizes<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.130> when<00:02:49.400> we<00:02:49.490> come<00:02:49.670> back<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.030> our<00:02:50.180> next

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.780 
sizes and when we come back in our next
videos<00:02:50.840> we'll<00:02:51.500> talk<00:02:51.680> about<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.640> it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790

that's on the spec sheet what do these

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's on the spec sheet what do these
numbers<00:02:55.520> mean<00:02:56.020> how<00:02:57.020> do<00:02:57.080> they<00:02:57.290> relate<00:02:57.590> to

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
numbers mean how do they relate to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.220 
numbers mean how do they relate to
bandwidth<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.520> we'll<00:02:59.360> get<00:02:59.480> inside<00:02:59.660> that<00:03:00.050> some

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
bandwidth and we'll get inside that some

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.750 
bandwidth and we'll get inside that some
of<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> parameters<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> mechanics<00:03:01.700> that
