00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
you know the the next season but from

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.779 
you know the the next season but from
what<00:00:53.539> i'm<00:00:53.660> hearing<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:54.260> couple<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:55.129> things<00:00:55.340> were

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
what i'm hearing a couple of things were

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.819 
what i'm hearing a couple of things were
changed<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.420> apparently<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.170> was<00:00:57.289> an<00:00:57.410> anime

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
changed and apparently it was an anime

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.770 
changed and apparently it was an anime
original<00:00:58.430> ending<00:00:58.670> that's<00:00:59.090> gonna<00:00:59.210> be<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.449> big

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
original ending that's gonna be a big

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.479 
original ending that's gonna be a big
problem<00:01:00.140> because<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.980> know<00:01:01.010> i<00:01:01.129> believe

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
problem because you know i believe

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.500 
problem because you know i believe
there's<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.820> manga

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
there's a manga

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.450 
there's a manga
we're<00:01:02.809> not<00:01:02.989> sanitized<00:01:03.440> i<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.949> i<00:01:04.039> believe

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
we're not sanitized i and i believe

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.300 
we're not sanitized i and i believe
there<00:01:04.910> is<00:01:05.149> still<00:01:05.420> gone<00:01:05.720> going<00:01:06.020> right<00:01:06.350> i'm<00:01:07.280> not

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
there is still gone going right i'm not

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.820 
there is still gone going right i'm not
right<00:01:08.270> correct<00:01:08.539> me<00:01:08.690> on<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.289> apparently

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
right correct me on that and apparently

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.279 
right correct me on that and apparently
it's<00:01:09.979> really<00:01:10.250> close<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.360> means<00:01:12.050> that

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's really close so that means that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.300 
it's really close so that means that
we're<00:01:12.410> probably<00:01:12.619> not<00:01:12.830> gonna<00:01:12.979> see<00:01:13.160> another

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
we're probably not gonna see another

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.249 
we're probably not gonna see another

head<00:01:49.849> back<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.560> after<00:01:51.560> getting<00:01:51.800> it<00:01:51.890> chopped

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
head back on after getting it chopped

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.040 
head back on after getting it chopped
off<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.520> oppa<00:01:52.849> pick<00:01:53.149> up<00:01:53.270> my<00:01:53.390> head<00:01:53.599> and<00:01:53.840> put<00:01:54.020> it

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
off and oppa pick up my head and put it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.279 
off and oppa pick up my head and put it
back<00:01:54.229> on<00:01:54.500> I'll<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:55.750> what<00:01:56.750> Goucher<00:01:57.170> is

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
back on I'll just like what Goucher is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.930 
back on I'll just like what Goucher is
doing<00:01:57.560> right<00:01:57.739> now<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:58.009> doesn't<00:01:58.220> seem<00:01:58.459> like<00:01:58.729> God

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
doing right now it doesn't seem like God

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.609 
doing right now it doesn't seem like God
is<00:01:59.149> type<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.509> Billy's<00:01:59.899> maybe<00:02:00.170> I'm<00:02:00.349> wrong<00:02:00.560> maybe

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
is type of Billy's maybe I'm wrong maybe

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.010 
is type of Billy's maybe I'm wrong maybe
I'm<00:02:01.160> right<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.580> do<00:02:01.819> not<00:02:02.209> know<00:02:02.479> it<00:02:02.720> seems<00:02:02.959> like

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
I'm right I do not know it seems like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.719 
I'm right I do not know it seems like
you<00:02:03.229> something<00:02:03.649> else<00:02:03.890> entirely<00:02:04.399> and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
you something else entirely and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.999 
you something else entirely and
hopefully<00:02:05.629> they<00:02:05.810> cover<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.229> in<00:02:06.379> season<00:02:06.770> two

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
hopefully they cover that in season two

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.650 
hopefully they cover that in season two
but<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.610> know<00:02:07.729> I'm<00:02:08.090> gonna<00:02:08.239> have<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.479> wait

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
but you know I'm gonna have to wait

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.150 
but you know I'm gonna have to wait
until<00:02:08.810> then<00:02:09.170> what<00:02:09.470> did<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.679> guys<00:02:09.860> think<00:02:09.920> about

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
until then what did you guys think about

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.250 
until then what did you guys think about
the<00:02:10.429> ending<00:02:10.819> in<00:02:10.940> its<00:02:11.300> entirety<00:02:11.660> because<00:02:11.900> I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the ending in its entirety because I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.839 
the ending in its entirety because I
thought<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:12.920> know<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.160> everything<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.700> was

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
thought you know of everything that was

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.640 
thought you know of everything that was
covered<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.239> until<00:02:14.599> you<00:02:14.810> know<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.170> end<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
covered up until you know the end of the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.710 
covered up until you know the end of the
Hendriks<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.099> sent<00:02:16.310> by<00:02:16.489> feast<00:02:17.120> fight<00:02:17.450> by<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
Hendriks you sent by feast fight by the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.660 
Hendriks you sent by feast fight by the
way<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.200> was<00:02:18.290> some<00:02:18.440> very<00:02:18.470> good<00:02:18.980> animation

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
way that was some very good animation

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.790 
way that was some very good animation
and<00:02:19.849> oh<00:02:20.239> there<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.870> was<00:02:20.959> really<00:02:21.379> really<00:02:21.560> well

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and oh there that was really really well

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.250 
and oh there that was really really well
animated<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.730> revenge<00:02:23.120> counter<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:24.080> was<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
animated the revenge counter that was a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.559 
animated the revenge counter that was a
really<00:02:24.680> nice

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
really nice

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.149 
really nice
scene<00:02:25.870> right<00:02:26.109> there<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.620> allowing

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
scene right there just allowing

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.890 
scene right there just allowing
everybody<00:02:27.579> to<00:02:27.790> attack<00:02:28.269> him<00:02:28.450> attack<00:02:28.719> him

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
everybody to attack him attack him

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.420 
everybody to attack him attack him
attack<00:02:29.200> him<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.650> apparently<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.189> is<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
attack him and apparently this is the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
attack him and apparently this is the
type<00:02:30.639> that<00:02:30.670> he's<00:02:30.939> never<00:02:31.180> used<00:02:31.329> around

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
type that he's never used around

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.959 
type that he's never used around
interesting<00:02:32.230> because<00:02:32.499> if<00:02:32.769> Henderson<00:02:33.370> knew<00:02:33.549> he

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
interesting because if Henderson knew he

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.220 
interesting because if Henderson knew he
probably<00:02:34.209> would<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.510> hit<00:02:34.659> his<00:02:34.840> tail<00:02:35.079> in

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
probably would have hit his tail in

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.390 
probably would have hit his tail in
between<00:02:35.530> his<00:02:35.650> legs<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:35.920> getting<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.219> heck

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
between his legs and getting the heck

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.770 
between his legs and getting the heck
out<00:02:36.579> of<00:02:36.609> there<00:02:36.849> man<00:02:37.030> everything<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.689> was

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
out of there man everything that was

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.330 
out of there man everything that was
covered<00:02:38.109> up<00:02:38.200> into<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.530> point<00:02:38.799> was<00:02:38.980> really

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
covered up into that point was really

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.160 
covered up into that point was really
well<00:02:39.489> animated<00:02:39.909> very<00:02:40.269> well<00:02:40.450> adapted<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:40.959> made

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
well animated very well adapted it made

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.869 
well animated very well adapted it made
sense<00:02:41.499> but<00:02:41.920> after<00:02:42.159> a<00:02:42.189> certain<00:02:42.430> point<00:02:42.700> they

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
sense but after a certain point they

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.849 
sense but after a certain point they
started<00:02:43.150> rushing<00:02:43.599> things<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.049> became<00:02:44.650> very

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
started rushing things it became very

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.170 
started rushing things it became very
apparent<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.340> they<00:02:45.489> wanted<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.790> rush<00:02:46.000> this

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
apparent that they wanted to rush this

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.119 
apparent that they wanted to rush this
episode<00:02:46.689> that's<00:02:46.930> in<00:02:47.170> terms<00:02:47.469> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> episode<00:02:48.099> I
