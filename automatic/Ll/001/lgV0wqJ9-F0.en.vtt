00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 and then staff here is welcome to lÃ©o 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.980
 tech news and I believe that most of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.779
 you already know that windows 10 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 was announced today 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 If you too, I'm going to leave one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.250
 link in the description that best explains 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.720
 what happened finally let's go there I want 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.679
 to pass on to you the main 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.000
 news of this new windows called the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 windows 10 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.670
 it will have an interface that fits 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 to the different forms let's say so 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.250
 to control the windows let's see that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.800
 you use a touchscreen can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 be a tablet can be a notebook have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 touch screen 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.239
 this new windows will adapt to this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.730
 way you use it then it 's all going to be 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.430
 adapted for you to use your finger 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.989
 let's see that you use the mouse and the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.359
 normal keyboard 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 then it will adapt to the mouse and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.810
 is a unique system for 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 any kind of screen touch screen or screen 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.760
 normal windows 10 will have a system 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.549
 called desk saw 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.619
 What is the purpose of this system? 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.650
 on the taskbar and will be 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.530
 responsible for the rapid exchange between 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.689
 files and open programs 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.960
 in addition the new windows will have a 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.750
 new file explorer this new 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.750
 explorer will be very useful will be 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.960
 much easier to find a file or 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 the program you want at the moment and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.909
 this is great because even a system 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 windows 8 search is very precarious by 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.079
 least in my opinion I find it horrible 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.869
 You do not think what you want and it's 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.040
 Microsoft has promised a new and 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.840
 much better 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.990
 something that was missing and was in the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.869
 microsoft implement was the system of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.740
 multiple workspaces and on windows 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.930
 10 and this will exist ie you will 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.729
 for example three areas of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 work at the same time in each area of 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.200
 Work, you put what you want. 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.330
 for example at first you put 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 the files there today that are 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.090
 editing on the other you put the tabs is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 the internet you are using and not 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
 Third, I do not know which one you want. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.989
 anyway just for you to understand that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.170
 really will be great and you know those 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.440
 programs that you can use on 128 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.069
 that you click there in the start menu 10 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.930
 like this 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.640
 there you click on the square open a 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.950
 full-screen program now you go 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.230
 able to use this same program in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.930
 window this will really be great 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940
 because if windows 8 despite having 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.830
 enough problem and everything and I give you 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.069
 brought enough interesting programs 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 in the windows shop now this program 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.940
 if you will be able to use it in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.730
 window and really is a very 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.209
 useful and finally Microsoft will 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.160
 put the start menu back on because the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.400
 microsoft made in this new windows is the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.560
 following is a mixture of a windows 7 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.599
 windows 8 it will have a start menu 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.690
 much like the start menu of the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.819
 windows 7 but with some elements of 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.329
 windows 8 them cards is that 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.209
 boxes that exist today in the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.019
 start from windows 8 and finally windows 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.410
 10 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.440
 will be a unified platform or 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.090
 it will work in all 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.010
 platforms 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.329
 for example you will have a tablet that 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.950
 will run windows 10 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.620
 You will have a smartphone that will also 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.829
 will run windows 10 and I realize 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.650
 your house will also run windows 10 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.280
 out other devices that will run a 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.440
 of the ten that microsoft is not commented on 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.690
 still and in a way this is great because 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.700
 you will be my system in all 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.530
 platforms that you use will not 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.299
 need to learn to tinker with a 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.209
 different platform every time you 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:07.079
 purchase a new equipment these were 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.870
 the main news of windows 10 is 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.609
 Did you like this news or did you 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 did not like comment 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.680
 below we will exchange an idea about 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.769
 this is as soon as you leave the trial version 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.720
 there for the general public with certainty 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.360
 will have a video on the channel talking is 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.599
 version and showing the link 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.500
 you download and test this 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.199
 new version 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.180
 I'll hold a big hug and even 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.180
 the next technician
