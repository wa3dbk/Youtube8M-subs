station<00:00:17.190> calm<00:00:17.609> I've<00:00:17.970> seen<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.840> Amazon<00:00:19.320> as

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
station calm I've seen it on Amazon as

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.960 
station calm I've seen it on Amazon as
well<00:00:19.680> that's<00:00:19.890> where<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.160> got<00:00:20.550> mine<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
well that's where I actually got mine it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.269 
well that's where I actually got mine it
comes<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.390> white<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.900> black<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.650> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
comes in white and black and it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.599 
comes in white and black and it's
similar<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> an<00:00:24.210> idea<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:25.260> extender<00:00:26.130> cable

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
similar to an idea of a extender cable

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.009 
similar to an idea of a extender cable
so<00:00:27.180> something<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:28.310> this<00:00:29.310> right<00:00:29.840> except<00:00:30.840> for

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
so something like this right except for

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.299 
so something like this right except for
the<00:00:31.109> differences<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:31.949> they've<00:00:32.279> made

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the differences is that they've made

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.810 
the differences is that they've made
this<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.180> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.719> smaller<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
this a little bit smaller so that it is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.540 
this a little bit smaller so that it is
more<00:00:35.910> likely<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.890> some<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
more likely to work with some of the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
more likely to work with some of the
cases<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.110> wouldn't<00:00:40.110> necessarily<00:00:40.230> fit<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
cases that wouldn't necessarily fit the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.610 
cases that wouldn't necessarily fit the
camera<00:00:41.550> connection<00:00:41.910> kit<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.450> dock<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
camera connection kit or the dock so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.420 
camera connection kit or the dock so
with<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> being<00:00:44.579> said<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.980> here

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
with that being said what you see here

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
with that being said what you see here
is<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.590> main<00:00:49.800> piece

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is what you get you get the main piece

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.799 
is what you get you get the main piece
itself<00:00:50.640> which<00:00:50.879> i'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> try<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
itself which i'm going to try out and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
itself which i'm going to try out and
then<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.800> originally<00:00:53.250> designed<00:00:53.430> for

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
their website you will see that it does

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.720 
their website you will see that it does
indeed<00:01:00.629> work<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> iPad<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.859> well<00:01:01.890> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that's what the back of it looks like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
that's what the back of it looks like
and<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> open<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:10.100> got<00:01:11.100> your

switch easy nude which is one of my
favorite<00:02:02.219> cases<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> flip<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
favorite cases we got to flip this the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
favorite cases we got to flip this the
other<00:02:03.570> way<00:02:03.659> around<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.950> pops<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.369> in

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
other way around and it pops right in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.839 
other way around and it pops right in
there<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.580> fits

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
there as you can see and it fits

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.190 
there as you can see and it fits
perfectly<00:02:09.450> so

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.830 

you<00:02:13.099> take<00:02:13.340> your<00:02:13.370> iPad<00:02:13.879> camera<00:02:14.120> connection<00:02:14.660> kit

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
you take your iPad camera connection kit

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.809 
you take your iPad camera connection kit
I<00:02:20.860> suppose<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.099> doesn't<00:02:22.459> matter<00:02:22.519> which

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
I suppose it really doesn't matter which

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:38.290 
I suppose it really doesn't matter which
one<00:02:22.849> of<00:02:23.060> these<00:02:23.269> we<00:02:23.480> try<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.670> see

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.950 

that<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.660> go<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.500> fits<00:02:40.740> right<00:02:40.980> on

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
that there you go and it fits right on

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.200 
that there you go and it fits right on
so<00:02:42.960> again<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> more<00:02:44.370> popular<00:02:44.520> cases

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
so again one of the more popular cases

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.360 
so again one of the more popular cases
is<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.330> belkin<00:02:45.840> grip<00:02:45.870> view<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.770> we<00:02:47.070> try<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
is the belkin grip view if we try this

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.360 
is the belkin grip view if we try this
with<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.970> send<00:02:48.390> station<00:02:48.900> dock<00:02:49.140> extender<00:02:49.380> with

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
with the send station dock extender with

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.490 
with the send station dock extender with
the<00:02:50.520> camera<00:02:50.910> kit<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.270> does<00:02:51.540> work<00:02:51.840> again<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
the camera kit it does work again I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.710 
the camera kit it does work again I
don't<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.550> keyboard<00:02:54.120> dock<00:02:54.360> I'm<00:02:54.570> not

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
don't have the keyboard dock I'm not

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.510 
don't have the keyboard dock I'm not
sure<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.200> well<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.040> work<00:02:56.250> with

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
sure how well that's going to work with

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.770 
sure how well that's going to work with
something<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.240> because<00:02:57.450> there's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
something like this because there's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.430 
something like this because there's
really<00:02:58.020> no<00:02:58.290> reinforcements<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.730> back<00:03:00.440> but

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
really no reinforcements in the back but

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.060 
really no reinforcements in the back but
I<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:02.040> confirm<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.910> indeed<00:03:03.270> works<00:03:03.570> so

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
I can confirm that this indeed works so

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.890 
I can confirm that this indeed works so
if<00:03:05.070> you're<00:03:05.280> willing<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.700> spend<00:03:05.730> about<00:03:06.209> 25<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
if you're willing to spend about 25 to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.370 
if you're willing to spend about 25 to
28<00:03:07.200> dollars<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.100> I'll<00:03:09.030> confirm<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
28 dollars for this I'll confirm that it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.870 
28 dollars for this I'll confirm that it
works<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.890> i'll<00:03:11.010> show<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:11.820> now

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
works and i'll show you that right now

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.630 
works and i'll show you that right now
so<00:03:12.360> i<00:03:12.390> plugged<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.440> sense<00:03:13.739> station<00:03:14.280> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
so i plugged in the sense station you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.040 
so i plugged in the sense station you
can<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> gives<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.600> bit<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> extra

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
can see it gives a little bit of extra

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.100 
can see it gives a little bit of extra
length<00:03:16.560> there<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.209> what<00:03:18.450> happens<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
length there but then what happens is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.880 
length there but then what happens is
when<00:03:19.380> we<00:03:19.500> plug<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:19.980> thing<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.470> i'm<00:03:22.590> using

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
when we plug this thing in and i'm using

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.370 
when we plug this thing in and i'm using
the<00:03:22.980> USB<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.640> right<00:03:23.850> now<00:03:26.270> it's<00:03:27.270> got<00:03:27.540> power<00:03:28.550> and

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
the USB one right now it's got power and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030 
the USB one right now it's got power and
there<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.470> goes<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.410> starts<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.920> load

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
there it goes and it starts to load

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.470 
there it goes and it starts to load
everything<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.670> so<00:03:36.270> indeed<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.290> does<00:03:37.709> work

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
everything up so indeed it does work

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.240 
everything up so indeed it does work
with<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.600> belkin<00:03:40.020> grip<00:03:40.050> view<00:03:40.500> that's<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
with the belkin grip view that's the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.800 
with the belkin grip view that's the
send<00:03:41.760> station<00:03:42.510> dock<00:03:42.780> extender<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.970> also<00:03:44.970> even

send station dock extender it also even

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.690 
send station dock extender it also even
though<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.049> fits<00:03:46.320> without<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.280> dock<00:03:47.459> extender

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
though it fits without the dock extender

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.000 
though it fits without the dock extender
the<00:03:48.330> camera<00:03:48.630> connection<00:03:48.959> kit<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.500> does<00:03:49.769> work

on<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.310> switch<00:03:50.549> easy<00:03:50.790> nude<00:03:51.090> as<00:03:51.269> well<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:52.170> also

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
on the switch easy nude as well it also

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.190 
on the switch easy nude as well it also
works<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.980> belkin<00:03:53.340> book<00:03:53.580> jacket<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.269> did

not try it with the macaulay I would

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.840 
not try it with the macaulay I would
anticipate<00:03:57.590> that<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.830> should<00:03:59.220> work<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
anticipate that it should work with the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.270 
anticipate that it should work with the
macaulay<00:04:00.230> Metro<00:04:01.230> pad<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.650> winner<00:04:04.860> so
