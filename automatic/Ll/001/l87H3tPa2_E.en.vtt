00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.570
 It is from those Tteyuu we see it is the youtube every time today 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.599
 I have a question 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.740
 I woke up in the morning for a diet, and I was eating breakfast 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:26.440
 It seems that heavy snow has come 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:34.180
 Takes effect What do we have here with in the to thank you the answer 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:46.460
 a First of all, it's better to eat that morning or that day 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:52.910
 First of all there is a hot day 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.489
 And say because other nutrition there is a possibility that can not be absorbed in using that anymore muscle also use 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:01.190
 The meaning of the house I took is completely gone 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:04.009
 So there is a risk that your muscles will be broken down and you will end up dying . 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 Care is a very important point 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.800
 The say that between quarrel Then a whole bunch from morning 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:18.880
 It was a very dangerous thing. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:26.110
 Getting up in the morning and getting that number of proteins right away is a terrible thing, isn't it? 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:31.790
 Things come with a protein often I well digested thought I Tanpakusu gentle there together 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 Kaato protein powder and or take a reason You're Then Well, for example, eggs become 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.410
 Well after something like Tteyuu somehow 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.550
 When the milk is also Iiitsu is also the sugar a little Well, I'd think I grew into one think about the fat content 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.230
 Well 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 It is egg white or naturally the counter is good or not, and I say it's severe there 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:56.320
 The I's, or rather a normal egg Toka milk is a good was part of bytes breakfast if you can 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.850
 The Tteyuu suddenly the raw vegetables wake up in the morning rather than raw vegetables, so still a little digestion water 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.740
 The Toka steamed vegetables 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.810
 Such a Toka thing that pace sandals and if there Datte that often put state things that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.310
 It's good for the body 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.990
 Ya and that as another breakfast 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 There is a feeling that you should really pull it out, but I want protein 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.920
 Because 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:24.680
 Nari drink protein protein carbohydrate'm really good is better to remove if possible two to eat 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.930
 Well that kind of thing you can't wake up without that morning glucose 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.640
 I think that loose or numbers, but it meets old Kana already and comes out well 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.640
 Is it is what Tteyuu ketone bodies 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:44.430
 One addition ketone to the brain speaking body is that if so by going in with that energy source 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 Furthermore, in from generation to generation within the carbohydrate Ozawa is that out because those who do not long, such as the sugar is easier to use ketone bodies 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:57.720
 There is a lot of time that is not created by having you get over the inheritance 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.630

 If you have to discharge that spare tank, a danger signal will appear. 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:00.690
 That danger signal is a desire to eat by all means 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.970
