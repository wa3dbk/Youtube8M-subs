00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
kind of shaking it down a little bit and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
kind of shaking it down a little bit and
I'll<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.149> swatch<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> onto<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.840> hand<00:00:49.050> there

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.729 
I'll just swatch it onto my hand there
and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.489> sort<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> work<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
and then I just sort of work it up and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.580 
and then I just sort of work it up and
down<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.719> don't<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.930> you'll<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.260> able<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
down now don't think you'll be able to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.880 
down now don't think you'll be able to
kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.449> earth<00:00:57.890> gold

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
kind of see all the earth gold

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
kind of see all the earth gold
reflecting<00:00:59.820> off<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
reflecting off there but it's a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410 
reflecting off there but it's a
beautiful<00:01:01.800> sort<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.010> natural<00:01:02.640> golden<00:01:03.149> finish

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
beautiful sort of natural golden finish

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.320 
beautiful sort of natural golden finish
that<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> offers<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> works<00:01:05.430> perfectly<00:01:06.030> as

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that it offers so it works perfectly as

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
that it offers so it works perfectly as
a<00:01:06.869> highlight<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.189> especially

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a highlight I think it's especially

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
a highlight I think it's especially
ideal<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> summer<00:01:09.540> time<00:01:09.750> where<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
ideal for the summer time where it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.300 
ideal for the summer time where it's
nice<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.939> glow<00:01:12.330> finish

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
nice to kind of have that glow finish

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.260 
nice to kind of have that glow finish
especially<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> jury

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
especially if you have a bit of a jury

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
especially if you have a bit of a jury
look<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> quite<00:01:16.860> nice<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
look and it's just quite nice as the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
look and it's just quite nice as the
lights<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.850> reflecting<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> video
