00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.449
 you can be wrong only once and not 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.449
 I want to be the one who was wrong 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.200
 buying sequences on the internet today yes 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.500
 can become a film producer 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 securing a quote in the titles of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.580
 tail is a method used by young people 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 filmmakers to be able to finance the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.740
 their film despite the crisis in Luciana 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.360
 parisi by dammela 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:34.150
 and he spins short and intense ok in 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.220
 fair with inspired the movie you see 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.559
 there is no better still does not exist yet 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.269
 is leaving day by day thanks 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.140
 to the contribution of so many on the internet 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.010
 they buy the frames we have 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.290
 printed frames 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.570
 these are the frames and what 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.129
 we do is look for people 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.129
 interested in financing the film 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.110
 buying a physical piece of the film 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 the era of copper is the first feature film 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.030
 Italian produced in crowdfounding 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.460
 English crowd means crowd fund and a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.510
 financing is indeed hundreds of 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.220
 people are not funding 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.310
 through a site that is found 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.320
 typing was copper on the net 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.570
 in practice they pay the ticket before 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.790
 the film arrives in the hall and they already know that 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.360
 in the credits there will also be theirs 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.430
 first name 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.590
 what we are interested in doing and while 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.659
 we work on the film search already and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 already build an audience that is a 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.830
 public at the same time is 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.100
 producer and future spectator of this 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.100
 movie 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 the reasoning behind it is simple 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.450
 public financing system of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 cinema is winding down from the banquet 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.799
 the younger ones are left out 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.350
 they are waiting for an opportunity 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.090
 we might as well look for other roads 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.909
 in this sense the era of copper is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.399
 a generational work addresses the theme 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.850
 of a generation that is in one 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.249
 situation in radical change 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.020
 so you will probably have to start over 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.299
 from scratch he will have to start from the beginning 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.719
 of a new era for construction one 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.719
 perspective 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.360
 tg3 ends here with the tg3 for le 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.460
 deaf people see you again today at 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.460
