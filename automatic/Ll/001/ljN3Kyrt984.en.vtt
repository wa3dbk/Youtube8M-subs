isn't<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.290> routine<00:00:54.620> by<00:00:54.770> itself<00:00:55.100> but<00:00:55.450> it<00:00:56.450> will

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
isn't a routine by itself but it will

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.740 
isn't a routine by itself but it will
help<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.470> let's<00:00:57.710> say<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.309> what<00:00:58.880> it's<00:00:59.239> it's<00:00:59.630> a
