00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
and it's weird to think about you know
you<00:01:24.750> could<00:01:24.960> argue<00:01:25.409> about<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> practice<00:01:26.520> put

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you could argue about the practice put

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
you could argue about the practice put
in<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.090> strategies<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.860> do

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
in and the strategies but if you do

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
in and the strategies but if you do
consider<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.000> maybe<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.479> people

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
consider you know maybe there are people

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.160 
consider you know maybe there are people
just<00:01:30.990> sweat<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.700> black<00:01:33.119> ops<00:01:33.329> league<00:01:33.570> play<00:01:33.840> or

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the ghost Columbia clan that could

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.810 
the ghost Columbia clan that could
actually<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.259> challenge<00:01:37.740> verse<00:01:38.610> these

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
entirely false but let's get back into

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.780 
entirely false but let's get back into
the<00:01:46.740> game<00:01:46.829> play<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.100> talk<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.610> bit

across from that but it doesn't happen
I'm<00:04:50.500> just<00:04:50.800> I'm<00:04:51.100> comparing<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.290> suppose<00:04:53.680> the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
I'm just I'm comparing so I suppose the

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.060 
I'm just I'm comparing so I suppose the
ak-74<00:04:54.670> you<00:04:55.300> what's<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.170> in<00:04:56.290> black<00:04:56.470> ops<00:04:56.620> 1<00:04:56.740> I

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
ak-74 you what's that in black ops 1 I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.270 
ak-74 you what's that in black ops 1 I
think<00:04:57.400> it<00:04:57.460> was<00:04:57.490> uh<00:04:58.170> took<00:04:59.170> at<00:04:59.860> least<00:05:00.010> have<00:05:00.250> a
