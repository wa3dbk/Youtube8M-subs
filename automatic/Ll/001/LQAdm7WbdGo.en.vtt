far<00:01:23.340> away<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.610> from<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.720> looks<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.200> be

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
far away but from here that looks to be

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.710 
far away but from here that looks to be
an<00:01:25.560> APC<00:01:26.220> tank<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.000> least<00:01:27.180> something<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
an APC tank or at least something of the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
an APC tank or at least something of the
sort<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> days<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
sort if you think back to the days of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
sort if you think back to the days of
GTA<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.119> APC<00:01:30.540> tank<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
GTA for the APC tank that was in that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
GTA for the APC tank that was in that
game<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.070> looks<00:01:32.310> extremely<00:01:32.670> similar<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
game this looks extremely similar same

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620 
game this looks extremely similar same
shape<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> same<00:01:34.619> size<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> don't

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shape about the same size so I don't

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.940 
shape about the same size so I don't
know<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.810> else<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> could<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.500> looks<00:01:37.710> like

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
know what else it could be it looks like

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
know what else it could be it looks like
an<00:01:38.070> APC<00:01:38.640> tank<00:01:38.939> unless<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.659> some<00:01:39.869> sort

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
an APC tank unless it's just some sort

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
an APC tank unless it's just some sort
of<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.409> armored<00:01:40.920> vehicle<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.610> I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of other armored vehicle but I'm

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
of other armored vehicle but I'm
thinking<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.689> APC<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.470> then<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> other

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
thinking it as an APC and then the other

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
thinking it as an APC and then the other
three<00:01:44.310> vehicles<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> shot<00:01:45.119> looked<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.630> be

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
three vehicles in the shot looked to be

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
three vehicles in the shot looked to be
two<00:01:46.170> black<00:01:46.500> Merryweather<00:01:47.009> jeeps<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.549> then

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
two black Merryweather jeeps and then

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
two black Merryweather jeeps and then
that<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.000> army<00:01:48.360> truck<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.560> that's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that one army truck so I think that's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.810 
that one army truck so I think that's
what<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.310> we've<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.790> more

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
what they are but we've got one more

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
what they are but we've got one more
shot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> APC<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.049> take<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> look<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.829> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
shot of the APC here take a look at this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
shot of the APC here take a look at this
I<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> little<00:01:53.820> hard<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I know it's a little hard to see it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.359 
I know it's a little hard to see it's
kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.840> obstructed<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> woman<00:01:56.009> shooting

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
kind of obstructed by the woman shooting

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
kind of obstructed by the woman shooting
the<00:01:56.520> bazooka<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> can't<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.409> right

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the bazooka but you can't see that right

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
the bazooka but you can't see that right
there<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.640> an<00:01:59.850> armored<00:02:00.180> vehicle<00:02:00.210> once

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
there it is an armored vehicle once

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
there it is an armored vehicle once
again<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> mean<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:02.040> looks<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:02.670> has<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
again I mean it looks like it even has a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
again I mean it looks like it even has a
gun<00:02:03.090> mounted<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.600> top<00:02:03.890> looks<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.130> got

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
gun mounted on top looks like it's got

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.920 
gun mounted on top looks like it's got
some<00:02:05.399> roll<00:02:05.610> bars<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> stuff<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
some roll bars and stuff going on but it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.660 
some roll bars and stuff going on but it
doesn't<00:02:07.259> look<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.680> normal<00:02:08.009> armored

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
doesn't look like a normal armored

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.279 
doesn't look like a normal armored
vehicle<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> looks<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.780> something<00:02:09.989> more

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
vehicle it looks like something more

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
vehicle it looks like something more
than<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.800> definitely<00:02:10.979> something<00:02:11.580> new

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
than that and definitely something new

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
than that and definitely something new
to<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> game<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:13.050> guess<00:02:13.110> we'll<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.379> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to the game so I guess we'll have to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.900 
to the game so I guess we'll have to
wait

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
wait

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.820 
wait
I'm<00:02:14.240> definitely<00:02:14.600> excited<00:02:15.020> but<00:02:15.350> let's<00:02:15.530> move<00:02:15.650> on

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I'm definitely excited but let's move on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.740 
I'm definitely excited but let's move on
here<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.580> next<00:02:16.850> scene<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.270> we<00:02:17.540> can

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
here so in this next scene here we can

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.660 
here so in this next scene here we can
see<00:02:17.930> one<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> new<00:02:18.530> masks<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.070> we<00:02:19.280> will<00:02:19.520> be

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
see one of the new masks that we will be

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.490 
see one of the new masks that we will be
getting<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.300> kind<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.660> interesting<00:02:20.930> looking

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
getting it's kind of interesting looking

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.800 
getting it's kind of interesting looking
it's<00:02:21.710> got<00:02:21.950> kind<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.430> makeup<00:02:23.120> like<00:02:23.480> blush

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
it's got kind of like makeup like blush

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.180 
it's got kind of like makeup like blush
on<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.050> cheeks<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.650> kind<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.950> weird

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
on the cheeks and kind of a weird

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.680 
on the cheeks and kind of a weird
expression<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.910> face<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.570> it's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
expression on the face but it's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.270 
expression on the face but it's
definitely<00:02:26.870> really<00:02:27.260> cool<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.740> really<00:02:27.770> unique

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
definitely really cool and really unique

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.040 
definitely really cool and really unique
it<00:02:28.520> looks<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.820> it's<00:02:29.000> kind<00:02:29.210> of<00:02:29.270> more<00:02:29.480> inspired

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
it looks like it's kind of more inspired

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.930 
it looks like it's kind of more inspired
by<00:02:30.260> theatre<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.980> drama<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.520> stuff<00:02:31.700> like<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
by theatre and drama and stuff like that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.210 
by theatre and drama and stuff like that
so<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.630> really<00:02:33.050> like<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.380> one<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.980> then<00:02:34.100> in

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
so I really like that one and then in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.860 
so I really like that one and then in
this<00:02:34.340> shot<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.790> we<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.180> got<00:02:35.390> what<00:02:35.420> looks<00:02:35.750> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
this shot here we have got what looks to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.570 
this shot here we have got what looks to
be<00:02:35.960> like<00:02:36.080> some<00:02:36.560> sort<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.860> super<00:02:37.310> drills

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
be like some sort of super drills

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.460 
be like some sort of super drills
something<00:02:38.120> extremely<00:02:38.540> high<00:02:38.870> powered<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:39.410> a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
something extremely high powered with a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.950 
something extremely high powered with a
giant<00:02:39.860> drill<00:02:40.220> bit<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.760> obviously<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.660> drill

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
giant drill bit on it obviously to drill

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.050 
giant drill bit on it obviously to drill
into<00:02:42.140> those<00:02:42.380> vaults<00:02:42.920> where<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.760> money's

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
into those vaults where the money's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.360 
into those vaults where the money's
probably<00:02:44.360> stashed<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.680> assume<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.130> you're

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
probably stashed so I assume that you're

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.650 
probably stashed so I assume that you're
going<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.520> be<00:02:46.580> controlling<00:02:47.240> that<00:02:47.420> it'll

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
going to be controlling that it'll

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.940 
going to be controlling that it'll
probably<00:02:47.810> put<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.410> first<00:02:48.620> person

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
probably put you in like first person

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.560 
probably put you in like first person
mode<00:02:49.070> where<00:02:49.310> you've<00:02:49.490> got<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.910> line<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.150> up<00:02:50.390> or

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
mode where you've got to line it up or

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.790 
mode where you've got to line it up or
something<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:51.470> do<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
something like that and then do the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.410 
something like that and then do the
drilling<00:02:52.160> yourself<00:02:52.520> that's<00:02:53.000> probably<00:02:53.300> going

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
drilling yourself that's probably going

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.060 
drilling yourself that's probably going
to<00:02:53.480> be<00:02:53.540> pretty<00:02:53.600> cool<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.920> see

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
to be pretty cool and here we get to see

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.220 
to be pretty cool and here we get to see
the<00:02:55.220> logo<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.850> heists<00:02:56.330> oh<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.020> beautiful

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the logo for the heists oh so beautiful

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.960 
the logo for the heists oh so beautiful
but<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.130> next<00:02:58.340> scene<00:02:58.490> take<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> look<00:02:58.880> at

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
but in this next scene take a look at

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.580 
but in this next scene take a look at
this<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.420> appears<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> be<00:03:00.140> one<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.440> new

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
this this appears to be one of the new

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.130 
this this appears to be one of the new
DLC<00:03:01.100> cars<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.580> are<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.150> added<00:03:02.630> with

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
DLC cars that are going to be added with

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.200 
DLC cars that are going to be added with
the<00:03:03.410> heist<00:03:03.620> dlc<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.610> from<00:03:04.790> what<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.970> can<00:03:05.060> see

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
the heist dlc so from what I can see

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.850 
the heist dlc so from what I can see
here<00:03:05.360> this<00:03:05.660> looks<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.990> be<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> sports<00:03:06.320> car<00:03:06.620> it's

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
here this looks to be a sports car it's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.370 
here this looks to be a sports car it's
nothing<00:03:07.130> too<00:03:07.280> exotic<00:03:07.400> too<00:03:07.910> over<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.180> top<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> I

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
nothing too exotic too over the top so I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.960 
nothing too exotic too over the top so I
assume<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.280> be<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.580> middle

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
assume this is going to be like a middle

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.910 
assume this is going to be like a middle
of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.060> line<00:03:11.300> price<00:03:11.690> range<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:12.380> lot<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.650> people

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
of the line price range a lot of people

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
of the line price range a lot of people
are<00:03:13.010> probably<00:03:13.280> going<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.490> be<00:03:13.550> able<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.850> afford

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
are probably going to be able to afford

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.400 
are probably going to be able to afford
this<00:03:14.300> because<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.870> said<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.110> doesn't<00:03:15.200> look

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
this because like I said it doesn't look

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.560 
this because like I said it doesn't look
too<00:03:15.620> crazy<00:03:15.980> but<00:03:16.580> it's<00:03:16.790> got<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> nice<00:03:17.180> matte

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
too crazy but it's got a nice matte

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.090 
too crazy but it's got a nice matte
paint<00:03:17.840> job<00:03:18.050> on<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.500> got<00:03:18.620> those<00:03:18.860> tinted

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
paint job on it it's got those tinted

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.740 
paint job on it it's got those tinted
windows<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.209> looks<00:03:20.330> like<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.540> just

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
windows and it looks like it's just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.930 
windows and it looks like it's just
themed<00:03:21.200> towards<00:03:21.740> heists<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.640> fact<00:03:22.850> that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
themed towards heists in the fact that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.820 
themed towards heists in the fact that
it<00:03:23.060> looks<00:03:23.240> almost<00:03:23.480> like<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:24.050> more<00:03:24.410> armored

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
it looks almost like a a more armored

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
it looks almost like a a more armored
heavy-duty<00:03:25.310> vehicle<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.540> they

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
heavy-duty vehicle in the you know they

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.150 
heavy-duty vehicle in the you know they
didn't<00:03:26.959> give<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> real<00:03:27.290> flashy<00:03:27.560> paint<00:03:27.950> job

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
didn't give it a real flashy paint job

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520 
didn't give it a real flashy paint job
it<00:03:28.310> looks<00:03:28.600> industrial<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.810> heavy-duty<00:03:30.050> so

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
it looks industrial and heavy-duty so

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.140 
it looks industrial and heavy-duty so
that's<00:03:30.800> pretty<00:03:30.950> cool<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.580> in<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.760> shot<00:03:31.970> here

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
that's pretty cool so in this shot here

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.580 
that's pretty cool so in this shot here
we<00:03:32.360> see<00:03:32.600> something<00:03:32.870> that's<00:03:33.200> kind<00:03:33.470> of

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
we see something that's kind of

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.410 
we see something that's kind of
interesting<00:03:33.830> we<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.550> see<00:03:34.730> our<00:03:34.910> regular

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
interesting we can see our regular

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.290 
interesting we can see our regular
cargobob<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.830> time<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.640> carrying<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
cargobob but this time it is carrying a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.480 
cargobob but this time it is carrying a
super<00:03:38.750> heavy-duty<00:03:39.050> magnet<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.800> is<00:03:39.920> able<00:03:40.190> to

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
super heavy-duty magnet that is able to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.340 
super heavy-duty magnet that is able to
lift<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.910> car<00:03:41.120> off<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.540> ground<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.900> carry<00:03:42.230> it

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
lift a car off the ground and carry it

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.350 
lift a car off the ground and carry it
so<00:03:42.920> while<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.310> does<00:03:43.580> look<00:03:43.790> really<00:03:44.000> cool<00:03:44.209> an

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
so while this does look really cool an

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.940 
so while this does look really cool an
epic<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:44.900> actually<00:03:45.320> still<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.709> playing

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
epic it's actually still just playing

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.130 
epic it's actually still just playing
the<00:03:46.010> exact<00:03:46.430> same<00:03:46.640> role<00:03:47.000> as<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.480> regular<00:03:47.900> hook

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
the exact same role as the regular hook

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.479 
the exact same role as the regular hook
I<00:03:48.380> mean<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.830> hook<00:03:48.950> you're<00:03:49.130> picking<00:03:49.400> up

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
I mean with the hook you're picking up

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.610 
I mean with the hook you're picking up
anything<00:03:49.760> from<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.180> small<00:03:50.420> sports<00:03:50.630> car<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.470> the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
anything from a small sports car to the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.320 
anything from a small sports car to the
dump<00:03:51.830> trucks<00:03:52.100> so<00:03:52.400> they're<00:03:52.820> essentially<00:03:53.300> doing

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
dump trucks so they're essentially doing

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330 
dump trucks so they're essentially doing
the<00:03:53.690> same<00:03:53.870> thing<00:03:54.230> unless<00:03:54.770> they're<00:03:54.890> going<00:03:55.280> to

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
the same thing unless they're going to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.320 
the same thing unless they're going to
add<00:03:55.459> some<00:03:55.489> sort<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:55.910> additional

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
add some sort of additional

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.210 
add some sort of additional
functionality<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.200> magnet<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:57.890> for<00:03:58.100> now

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
functionality to the magnet but for now

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.140 
functionality to the magnet but for now
it<00:03:58.310> looks<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.670> does<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.910> exact<00:03:59.120> same

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
it looks like it does the exact same

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.060 
it looks like it does the exact same
thing<00:03:59.480> as<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.690> hook<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.230> for<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.530> reason<00:04:00.590> I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
thing as the hook so for that reason I

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.140 
thing as the hook so for that reason I
don't<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.520> if<00:04:01.580> we<00:04:01.670> were<00:04:01.730> going<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.880> see<00:04:02.030> this

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
don't know if we were going to see this

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.970 
don't know if we were going to see this
in<00:04:02.330> free<00:04:02.510> roam<00:04:02.630> being<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:03.739> pretty<00:04:03.890> much

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
in free roam being that it's pretty much

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.560 
in free roam being that it's pretty much
the<00:04:04.130> same<00:04:04.430> thing<00:04:04.489> with<00:04:04.880> just<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.270> different

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
the same thing with just a different

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.120 
the same thing with just a different
look<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.530> get<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.739> glimpse<00:04:06.980> of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
look to it so here we get a glimpse of

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.220 
look to it so here we get a glimpse of
the<00:04:07.250> planning<00:04:07.640> board<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.180> also<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> nice<00:04:08.930> water

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the planning board and also a nice water

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.870 
the planning board and also a nice water
shot<00:04:09.530> but<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.739> want<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.010> pause<00:04:10.130> here<00:04:10.160> this<00:04:10.640> looks

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
shot but I want to pause here this looks

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.310 
shot but I want to pause here this looks
to<00:04:10.970> be<00:04:11.000> part<00:04:11.270> of<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.420> prison<00:04:11.840> break<00:04:12.050> heist

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
to be part of the prison break heist

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.840 
to be part of the prison break heist
where<00:04:12.590> you've<00:04:12.739> got<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.040> get<00:04:13.160> your<00:04:13.280> friend<00:04:13.670> off

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
where you've got to get your friend off

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.300 
where you've got to get your friend off
the<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.660> prison<00:04:15.020> bus<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.590> save<00:04:15.830> him<00:04:16.100> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
the the prison bus and save him and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.860 
the the prison bus and save him and
basically<00:04:16.609> intercept<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.299> bus<00:04:17.450> before<00:04:17.660> he

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
basically intercept the bus before he

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.810 
basically intercept the bus before he
gets<00:04:18.109> there<00:04:18.200> from<00:04:18.590> what<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.770> understand<00:04:19.370> but

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
gets there from what I understand but

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.760 
gets there from what I understand but
taking<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.209> look<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.510> your<00:04:20.630> left<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.260> think

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
taking a look on your left there I think

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.140 
taking a look on your left there I think
that's<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:21.979> new<00:04:22.130> mask<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.640> looks<00:04:22.820> kind<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.090> like

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
that's a new mask it looks kind of like

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730 
that's a new mask it looks kind of like
I<00:04:23.690> don't<00:04:23.900> know<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:24.200> pretty<00:04:24.289> gnarly-looking

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
I don't know it's pretty gnarly-looking

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.680 
I don't know it's pretty gnarly-looking
it's<00:04:25.250> basically<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.669> face<00:04:25.970> with<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.270> whole<00:04:26.510> bunch

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
it's basically a face with a whole bunch

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.670 
it's basically a face with a whole bunch
of<00:04:26.780> cuts<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.289> stitch

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
of cuts and stitch

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.650 
of cuts and stitch
across<00:04:28.009> it<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.729> looks<00:04:28.850> pretty<00:04:29.090> neat<00:04:29.330> but

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
across it and it looks pretty neat but

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.870 
across it and it looks pretty neat but
moving<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.199> this<00:04:30.350> next<00:04:30.410> shot<00:04:31.009> here<00:04:31.340> this<00:04:31.729> is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
moving on to this next shot here this is

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.390 
moving on to this next shot here this is
even<00:04:32.120> cooler<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:33.139> some<00:04:33.500> dudes<00:04:33.800> from<00:04:34.070> GTA

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
even cooler we have some dudes from GTA

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.939 
even cooler we have some dudes from GTA
online<00:04:34.460> in<00:04:35.030> police<00:04:35.600> uniforms<00:04:36.229> my<00:04:36.590> first<00:04:36.800> time

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
online in police uniforms my first time

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.320 
online in police uniforms my first time
watching<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.400> through<00:04:37.729> I<00:04:37.759> just<00:04:38.180> thought

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
watching this through I just thought

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.969 
watching this through I just thought
that<00:04:38.389> those<00:04:38.600> were<00:04:38.810> regular<00:04:39.229> cops<00:04:39.530> but<00:04:39.770> upon

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
that those were regular cops but upon

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.650 
that those were regular cops but upon
any<00:04:40.130> second<00:04:40.490> watching<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:41.000> mean<00:04:41.150> clearly<00:04:41.270> the

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
any second watching I mean clearly the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.029 
any second watching I mean clearly the
guy<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:41.990> left<00:04:42.110> full<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.740> all<00:04:42.889> those

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
guy on the left full of all those

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.710 
guy on the left full of all those
tattoos<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.639> everything<00:04:43.669> in<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:44.419> haircut

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
tattoos and everything in that haircut

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.740 
tattoos and everything in that haircut
he<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.440> clearly<00:04:45.770> not<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:47.000> regular<00:04:47.270> Cobb

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
he is clearly not just a regular Cobb

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.420 
he is clearly not just a regular Cobb
this<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:48.229> probably<00:04:48.500> for<00:04:48.710> part<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.250> heist

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
this is probably for part of a heist

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.560 
this is probably for part of a heist
where<00:04:49.669> you're<00:04:49.820> going<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.030> have<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.479> know

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
where you're going to have to you know

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.180 
where you're going to have to you know
sneak<00:04:50.840> into<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> police<00:04:51.259> station<00:04:51.320> dressed<00:04:52.009> as

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
sneak into the police station dressed as

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.550 
sneak into the police station dressed as
a<00:04:52.220> cop<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:53.539> know<00:04:53.660> do<00:04:53.930> something<00:04:54.229> with

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
a cop and you know do something with

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.260 
a cop and you know do something with
that<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.190> moving<00:04:55.340> on<00:04:55.550> here<00:04:55.759> we<00:04:55.910> get<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.090> few

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
that so moving on here we get a few

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.580 
that so moving on here we get a few
glimpses<00:04:56.539> of<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.930> things<00:04:57.199> that<00:04:57.350> we've<00:04:57.470> been

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
glimpses of the things that we've been

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.719 
glimpses of the things that we've been
hearing<00:04:57.830> about<00:04:57.979> but<00:04:58.310> nothing<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:58.580> I

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
hearing about but nothing that I

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.330 
hearing about but nothing that I
particularly<00:04:59.389> want<00:04:59.900> to<00:04:59.960> stop<00:05:00.229> on<00:05:00.440> until<00:05:01.220> they

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
particularly want to stop on until they

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.400 
particularly want to stop on until they
show<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.789> this<00:05:02.389> is<00:05:02.539> another<00:05:02.780> shot<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.259> the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
show this this is another shot of the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.650 
show this this is another shot of the
APC<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.220> this<00:05:04.580> time<00:05:04.759> the<00:05:04.940> hatch<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.300> open

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
APC and this time the hatch is open

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.029 
APC and this time the hatch is open
you've<00:05:05.780> got<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:05.990> gunner<00:05:06.349> shooting<00:05:06.800> out<00:05:06.919> of<00:05:06.949> the

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
you've got a gunner shooting out of the

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.980 
you've got a gunner shooting out of the
top<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:07.910> you've<00:05:08.090> got<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.330> mounted

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
top of it so you've got a mounted

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.529 
top of it so you've got a mounted
machine<00:05:09.169> gun<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.400> really<00:05:10.970> epic<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.479> on

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
machine gun that is really epic and on

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.360 
machine gun that is really epic and on
top<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.259> thing's<00:05:12.500> probably<00:05:12.770> really

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
top of that this thing's probably really

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.490 
top of that this thing's probably really
heavy<00:05:13.580> armored<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.509> it<00:05:14.840> can<00:05:14.990> probably<00:05:15.320> pretty

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
heavy armored and it can probably pretty

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.589 
heavy armored and it can probably pretty
much<00:05:15.650> take<00:05:15.919> out<00:05:16.070> anything<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.789> its<00:05:16.940> way<00:05:17.090> just

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
much take out anything in its way just

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.839 
much take out anything in its way just
like<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:17.840> did<00:05:17.990> in<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.199> days<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.620> GTA<00:05:19.009> 4<00:05:19.310> that

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
like we did in the days of GTA 4 that

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.089 
like we did in the days of GTA 4 that
APC<00:05:20.180> tank<00:05:20.599> was<00:05:20.780> epic<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.349> this<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.770> anything

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
APC tank was epic if this is anything

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.920 
APC tank was epic if this is anything
like<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.460> one<00:05:22.849> was<00:05:23.030> then<00:05:23.630> this<00:05:23.780> is

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
like that one was then this is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.140 
like that one was then this is
definitely<00:05:24.080> going<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.680> be<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:25.099> lot<00:05:25.460> of<00:05:25.580> fun<00:05:25.789> so

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
definitely going to be a lot of fun so

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.730 
definitely going to be a lot of fun so
up<00:05:26.300> next<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:26.660> actually<00:05:26.990> get<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.139> better<00:05:27.410> shot<00:05:27.530> of

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
up next we actually get a better shot of

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.439 
up next we actually get a better shot of
these<00:05:28.070> vehicles<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.820> something<00:05:29.180> i<00:05:29.270> should

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
these vehicles and something i should

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.610 
these vehicles and something i should
point<00:05:29.570> out<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.080> fact<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.440> these

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
point out is the fact that these

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.080 
point out is the fact that these
vehicles<00:05:30.919> are<00:05:31.220> not<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.639> same<00:05:31.820> they're

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
vehicles are not the same they're

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.580 
vehicles are not the same they're
actually<00:05:32.539> different<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.110> here's<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.440> first

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
actually different so here's the first

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.379 
actually different so here's the first
one<00:05:33.740> and<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.430> can<00:05:34.550> actually<00:05:34.699> see<00:05:34.940> that<00:05:35.270> it

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
one and you can actually see that it

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.029 
one and you can actually see that it
kind<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.750> looks<00:05:35.960> almost<00:05:36.199> like<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.500> super

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
kind of looks almost like a super

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.219 
kind of looks almost like a super
armored<00:05:37.490> Merryweather<00:05:38.060> jeep<00:05:38.389> there's<00:05:39.020> really

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
armored Merryweather jeep there's really

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.839 
armored Merryweather jeep there's really
no<00:05:39.500> weapons<00:05:40.039> attached<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.580> from<00:05:40.699> what<00:05:40.820> i

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
no weapons attached to it from what i

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.939 
no weapons attached to it from what i
can<00:05:40.970> see<00:05:41.150> but<00:05:41.780> it<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:41.990> clearly<00:05:42.349> heavily

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
can see but it is clearly heavily

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.260 
can see but it is clearly heavily
armored<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.340> then<00:05:43.639> when<00:05:43.820> we<00:05:43.940> shift<00:05:44.090> our<00:05:44.210> focus

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
armored and then when we shift our focus

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.240 
armored and then when we shift our focus
to<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.720> second<00:05:45.169> one<00:05:45.289> you<00:05:45.680> can<00:05:45.830> see<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:46.130> this

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
to the second one you can see that this

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.219 
to the second one you can see that this
thing<00:05:46.460> is<00:05:46.490> clearly<00:05:46.970> very<00:05:47.389> different<00:05:47.960> than<00:05:48.080> the

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
thing is clearly very different than the

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.899 
thing is clearly very different than the
front<00:05:48.500> one<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:48.919> mean<00:05:49.070> it's<00:05:49.250> an<00:05:49.400> entirely

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
front one I mean it's an entirely

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.399 
front one I mean it's an entirely
different<00:05:50.419> shape<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.840> looks<00:05:51.020> like<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.260> has

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
different shape it looks like it has

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.350 
different shape it looks like it has
even<00:05:51.440> more<00:05:51.830> armor<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.370> more<00:05:52.880> importantly

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
even more armor and more importantly

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.570 
even more armor and more importantly
it's<00:05:53.599> got<00:05:54.020> a<00:05:54.050> hatch<00:05:54.320> on<00:05:54.560> top<00:05:54.770> with<00:05:55.010> a<00:05:55.039> machine

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
it's got a hatch on top with a machine

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.189 
it's got a hatch on top with a machine
gun<00:05:55.639> sticking<00:05:56.180> out<00:05:56.419> of<00:05:56.509> the<00:05:56.570> top<00:05:56.599> like<00:05:57.020> we

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
gun sticking out of the top like we

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.620 
gun sticking out of the top like we
already<00:05:57.500> said<00:05:57.949> so<00:05:58.310> as<00:05:58.550> we<00:05:58.940> can<00:05:59.030> see<00:05:59.090> there<00:05:59.479> are

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
already said so as we can see there are

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.800 
already said so as we can see there are
actually<00:06:00.050> two<00:06:00.259> different<00:06:00.470> types<00:06:01.039> of<00:06:01.419> APC<00:06:02.419> tank

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810

carrier<00:06:09.770> so<00:06:10.340> as<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.550> keep<00:06:10.729> saying<00:06:10.940> it's<00:06:11.180> hard<00:06:11.389> to

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
carrier so as I keep saying it's hard to

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.939 
carrier so as I keep saying it's hard to
say<00:06:11.630> whether<00:06:11.900> or<00:06:12.050> not<00:06:12.139> this<00:06:12.289> is<00:06:12.349> going<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.830> be<00:06:12.919> a

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
say whether or not this is going to be a

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.249 
say whether or not this is going to be a
heist<00:06:13.430> exclusive<00:06:14.240> or<00:06:14.539> if<00:06:14.780> these<00:06:14.930> are<00:06:15.080> going<00:06:15.199> to

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259

start spawning out in the water in free
roam<00:06:16.699> I<00:06:17.150> assume<00:06:17.690> it's<00:06:17.870> probably<00:06:18.440> going<00:06:18.560> to<00:06:18.620> be

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680

roam I assume it's probably going to be
heist<00:06:18.889> exclusive<00:06:19.610> but<00:06:19.789> I<00:06:19.820> kind<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.060> hope<00:06:20.240> that

I'm wrong moving on take a look at this

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.510

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
that plane just lifted up vertically do

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.040 
that plane just lifted up vertically do
you<00:06:25.610> know<00:06:25.759> what<00:06:25.909> that<00:06:25.940> means<00:06:26.150> it<00:06:26.479> just<00:06:26.659> lifted

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
you know what that means it just lifted

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.930 
you know what that means it just lifted
straight<00:06:27.289> up<00:06:27.380> off<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.740> ground<00:06:27.860> that<00:06:28.250> means

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:48.549 
appears to be a flare shot from a flare
gun<00:06:47.149> so<00:06:47.599> it<00:06:47.689> looks<00:06:47.749> like<00:06:47.929> these<00:06:48.229> are<00:06:48.409> also

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:48.559
