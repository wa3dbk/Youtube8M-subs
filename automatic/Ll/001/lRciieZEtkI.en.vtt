what I did with the helicopter here I

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.029 
what I did with the helicopter here I
actually<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> motor<00:00:56.699> inside<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually put a motor inside of it so it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.170 
actually put a motor inside of it so it
can<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.399> run<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.070> I'll<00:01:02.760> show<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
can actually run and I'll show that to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
can actually run and I'll show that to
you<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.790> let<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.890> get

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you right now let me see if I can get

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
you right now let me see if I can get
the<00:01:07.979> arm<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> still<00:01:09.060> managed<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.689> able

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the arm out I still managed to be able

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
the arm out I still managed to be able
to<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> arm<00:01:10.530> back<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to put the arm back in there and that's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
to put the arm back in there and that's
still<00:01:12.420> fully<00:01:12.780> functional<00:01:15.470> there<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
still fully functional there we go and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:28.120 
still fully functional there we go and
here<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.790> go

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.580 

so<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.760> works<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.590> there's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so that's how that works and there's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.890 
so that's how that works and there's
also<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:32.930> light<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.410> bottom<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.800> there<00:01:34.980> and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
also a light on the bottom of there and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.520 
also a light on the bottom of there and
it<00:01:36.900> also<00:01:37.050> has<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.010> LED<00:01:38.790> lights<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:40.260> power

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it also has the LED lights from power

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
it also has the LED lights from power
functions<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.240> makes<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.630> light<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.050> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
functions and so makes the light kind of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.360 
functions and so makes the light kind of
light<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.440> through<00:01:43.650> there<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:44.010> that's<00:01:44.160> pretty

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
light up through there so that's pretty

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.810 
light up through there so that's pretty
cool<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.400> see<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
cool so that's that you can see that

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.420 
cool so that's that you can see that
there's<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> rock<00:01:49.170> wall<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.830> runs<00:01:50.040> along

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's a rock wall that runs along

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.260 
there's a rock wall that runs along
everything<00:01:51.300> here<00:01:52.010> that<00:01:53.010> runs<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.180> way

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
everything here that runs all the way

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.640 
everything here that runs all the way
over<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> other<00:01:54.780> side<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.410> I'll<00:01:55.530> be

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650

carpet<00:02:24.390> right<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:25.070> I'm<00:02:26.070> still<00:02:26.430> debating<00:02:26.670> on

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
carpet right now I'm still debating on

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.820 
carpet right now I'm still debating on
what<00:02:27.209> I'm<00:02:27.330> gonna<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.170> originally

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
what I'm gonna do with that I originally

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.390 
what I'm gonna do with that I originally
had<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:30.200> blue<00:02:31.200> blankets<00:02:31.709> spread<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.160> but

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
had some blue blankets spread out but

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.550 
had some blue blankets spread out but
that<00:02:32.580> was<00:02:32.670> hard<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.330> because<00:02:33.930> they

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that was hard to be just because they

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040 
that was hard to be just because they
got<00:02:34.739> all<00:02:35.300> crumpled<00:02:36.300> up<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.540> stuff<00:02:36.810> when<00:02:36.959> you

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
got all crumpled up and stuff when you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350 
got all crumpled up and stuff when you
stepped<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.500> them<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.180> want

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
stepped on them and I really don't want

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.470 
stepped on them and I really don't want
to<00:02:39.420> do<00:02:39.570> blue<00:02:40.230> base<00:02:40.769> plates<00:02:41.190> right<00:02:41.430> now<00:02:41.489> because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
to do blue base plates right now because

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.120 
to do blue base plates right now because
I<00:02:42.600> won't<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.870> able<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.110> step<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.530> those<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.980> get

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
I won't be able to step on those and get

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.080 
I won't be able to step on those and get
up<00:02:44.370> close<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
up close so for now it's just like this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:55.190 
up close so for now it's just like this
and<00:02:48.090> here's<00:02:48.570> my<00:02:48.830> coast<00:02:49.830> guard<00:02:50.070> tower<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:54.200> have

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.910 
and here's my coast guard tower I have
it<00:02:55.320> built<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.010> bit<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:58.500> area

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
it built up a little bit and this area

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.660 
it built up a little bit and this area
right<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.610> is<00:03:00.050> just<00:03:01.050> empty<00:03:01.560> green<00:03:02.400> right

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

now I have the cannon in the middle

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.259 
now I have the cannon in the middle
that's<00:03:05.610> kind<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> memorial<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.269> then

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
that's kind of like a memorial and then

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.250 
that's kind of like a memorial and then

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
this one if you remember those of you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.240 
this one if you remember those of you
that<00:03:26.880> have<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.209> set<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.600> have<00:03:27.750> seen<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.250> I

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
that have this set or have seen it I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920 
that have this set or have seen it I
modified<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> back<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> little<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.810> make

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
modified the back a little bit to make

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.520 
modified the back a little bit to make
it<00:03:30.989> kind<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.350> more<00:03:31.410> realistic<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:33.260> go<00:03:34.260> well

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
it kind of more realistic and go well

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.199 
it kind of more realistic and go well
with<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.010> other<00:03:35.190> one<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:37.520> those<00:03:38.520> arms<00:03:38.880> fold

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
with the other one so those arms fold

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.790 
with the other one so those arms fold
out<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.420> then<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.959> can

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
out and then you can

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.740 
out and then you can
bring<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> boat<00:03:41.340> off<00:03:41.550> like<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.750> moving

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
bring the boat off like that and moving

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.530 
bring the boat off like that and moving
on<00:03:46.050> over<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:47.870> here's<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:50.540> communications

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
and here's a custom sailboat that I made

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.229 
and here's a custom sailboat that I made
a<00:04:16.070> while<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.100> it's<00:04:17.670> actually<00:04:17.850> built

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
a while back it's actually built

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.380 
a while back it's actually built
completely<00:04:18.870> upside<00:04:19.560> down<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.390> see

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
completely upside down if you can see

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.760 
completely upside down if you can see
that<00:04:21.600> just<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:24.750> different<00:04:25.140> technique<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.740> I

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
that just a different technique that I

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.520 
that just a different technique that I
decided<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.490> try<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.270> it's<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.170> up<00:04:28.350> on

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
decided to try and it's just up on

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.570 
decided to try and it's just up on
blocks<00:04:28.800> right<00:04:29.130> now

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
blocks right now

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.550 
blocks right now
kind<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.940> sitting<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:31.400> area<00:04:32.400> over<00:04:32.640> there

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
kind of sitting in the area over there

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.900 
kind of sitting in the area over there
and<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.820> my<00:04:36.000> rock<00:04:36.270> wall<00:04:36.540> continues<00:04:37.400> all<00:04:38.400> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
and so my rock wall continues all the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.900 
and so my rock wall continues all the
way<00:04:39.000> over<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:43.220> I'll<00:04:44.220> show<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.610> this

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
way over here and I'll show you this

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.390 
way over here and I'll show you this
ramp<00:04:45.300> part<00:04:45.570> in<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.960> second<00:04:48.260> ok<00:04:49.260> I'm<00:04:49.380> back<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.920> I

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
ramp part in a second ok I'm back and I

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.550 
ramp part in a second ok I'm back and I
rearranged<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.030> few<00:04:51.210> things<00:04:51.480> so<00:04:52.170> hopefully<00:04:52.260> you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
rearranged a few things so hopefully you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.200 
rearranged a few things so hopefully you
can<00:04:52.620> see<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.920> better<00:04:53.130> now<00:04:53.250> it's<00:04:53.970> kind<00:04:54.150> of

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
can see it better now it's kind of

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.880 
can see it better now it's kind of
cramped<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.720> corner<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.350> I'll<00:04:55.500> do<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.770> best

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
cramped in a corner so I'll do the best

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.910 
cramped in a corner so I'll do the best
I<00:04:56.100> can<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.370> show<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.730> here<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.710> see

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
I can to show you here but you can see

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.300
