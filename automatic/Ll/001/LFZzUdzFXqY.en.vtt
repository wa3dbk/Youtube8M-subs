just to show you the basic functionality

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.149 
just to show you the basic functionality
and<00:00:52.250> gameplay<00:00:53.410> so<00:00:54.410> are<00:00:54.649> all<00:00:54.860> these<00:00:54.949> two

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
and gameplay so are all these two

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.189 
and gameplay so are all these two
abilities<00:00:55.460> one<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.329> teleport<00:00:56.839> any<00:00:57.019> other

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
abilities one is the teleport any other

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.670 
abilities one is the teleport any other
is<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.500> charge<00:00:57.909> so<00:00:59.019> teleport<00:01:00.019> works<00:01:00.229> if<00:01:00.530> you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
is the charge so teleport works if you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.240 
is the charge so teleport works if you
hold<00:01:00.890> down<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.120> left<00:01:02.600> mouse<00:01:02.930> button<00:01:03.379> he

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.399 
hold down the left mouse button he
charges<00:01:04.550> up<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.879> shot<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.449> then<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.200> can

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
charges up the shot and then you can

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.380 
charges up the shot and then you can
right-click<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:07.190> teleport<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.850> location

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
right-click to teleport to the location

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.070 
right-click to teleport to the location
of<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.509> ball<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.119> other<00:01:11.270> ability<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:12.050> the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
of the ball so the other ability is the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.300 
of the ball so the other ability is the
charge<00:01:12.619> if<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.820> press<00:01:14.810> space<00:01:15.110> like<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:15.979> are

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
charge if you press space like so are

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.310 
charge if you press space like so are
always<00:01:16.880> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.179> charge<00:01:17.479> towards<00:01:18.140> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
always going to charge towards the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.550 
always going to charge towards the
cursor<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.759> really<00:01:20.030> important<00:01:20.690> as<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
cursor this is really important as the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.279 
cursor this is really important as the
charge<00:01:21.830> acts<00:01:22.220> like<00:01:22.670> your<00:01:22.820> lifeline<00:01:23.360> so<00:01:23.720> for

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
charge acts like your lifeline so for

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.200 
charge acts like your lifeline so for
instance<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.649> you're<00:01:24.770> falling<00:01:25.159> down<00:01:25.399> great

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
instance if you're falling down great

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.180 
instance if you're falling down great
distance<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.869> can<00:01:26.990> always<00:01:27.259> gain<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.770> couple<00:01:27.979> of

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
distance you can always gain a couple of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.940 
distance you can always gain a couple of
seconds<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:29.300> air<00:01:29.539> damage<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:31.490> air<00:01:31.940> time

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
seconds of air damage of air time

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.590 
seconds of air damage of air time
combining<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.340> teleporter<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:34.940> charge<00:01:35.240> is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
combining the teleporter the charge is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.830 
combining the teleporter the charge is
by<00:01:35.990> arrow<00:01:36.200> as<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:37.340> allows<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.659> survive

release later this year the learning
curve<00:01:55.849> has<00:01:56.420> been<00:01:56.690> something<00:01:57.080> we've<00:01:57.319> been

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
curve has been something we've been

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.609 
curve has been something we've been
looking<00:01:57.970> strongly<00:01:58.970> at<00:01:59.259> in<00:02:00.259> order<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.500> make
