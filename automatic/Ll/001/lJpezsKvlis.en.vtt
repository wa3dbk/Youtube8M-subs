00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.250 
those are probably my favorite of all of
the<00:02:51.340> trooper<00:02:52.340> characters<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.510> lastly<00:02:54.049> but

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
the trooper characters and lastly but

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.650 
the trooper characters and lastly but
not<00:02:54.320> least<00:02:54.769> we<00:02:55.040> get<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.459> new<00:02:55.700> commando<00:02:56.330> droid

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
not least we get the new commando droid

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.320 
not least we get the new commando droid
very<00:02:57.380> cool<00:02:57.709> figure<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.100> usually<00:02:58.640> do<00:02:58.790> not<00:02:58.820> like

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
very cool figure I usually do not like

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.199 
very cool figure I usually do not like
droid<00:02:59.810> figures<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:00.560> they<00:03:00.799> feel

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
droid figures because they feel

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.449 
droid figures because they feel
ultimately<00:03:02.209> flimsy<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.049> my<00:03:03.290> hand<00:03:03.590> but<00:03:04.250> when<00:03:04.430> I

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
ultimately flimsy in my hand but when I

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.380 
ultimately flimsy in my hand but when I
held<00:03:04.850> both<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.390> these<00:03:05.690> figures<00:03:06.049> they<00:03:06.980> feel

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
held both of these figures they feel

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.970 
held both of these figures they feel
substantially<00:03:08.390> more<00:03:08.540> sturdy<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.830> see

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
substantially more sturdy you can see

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.460 
substantially more sturdy you can see
the<00:03:10.130> legs<00:03:10.370> are<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:10.580> little<00:03:10.640> bit<00:03:10.940> bigger<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.510> for

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the legs are a little bit bigger and for

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.680 
the legs are a little bit bigger and for
some<00:03:12.709> reason<00:03:12.740> when<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> put<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.640> together<00:03:13.790> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
some reason when I put it together it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.180 
some reason when I put it together it
seems<00:03:15.200> like<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
seems like the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.850 
seems like the
the<00:03:16.300> overall<00:03:17.300> grip<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:18.020> both<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> figures

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
the overall grip of both of the figures

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.310 
the overall grip of both of the figures
were<00:03:19.490> a<00:03:19.520> lot<00:03:19.790> higher<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:20.900> don't<00:03:21.080> just

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
were a lot higher so they don't just

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.890 
were a lot higher so they don't just
crumble<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.190> your<00:03:22.310> hands<00:03:22.550> as<00:03:22.790> easily<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.360> really

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
crumble in your hands as easily I really

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.820 
crumble in your hands as easily I really
like<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:25.360> really<00:03:26.360> cool<00:03:26.570> new<00:03:26.600> head<00:03:27.050> mold<00:03:27.320> for

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
like that really cool new head mold for

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.800 
like that really cool new head mold for
these<00:03:28.010> commando<00:03:28.640> droids<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.210> they<00:03:29.540> are<00:03:29.690> in

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
these commando droids and they are in

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.460 
these commando droids and they are in
the<00:03:29.960> new<00:03:30.280> dark<00:03:31.280> chocolate<00:03:31.760> brown<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:33.380> course

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
the new dark chocolate brown of course

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.160 
the new dark chocolate brown of course
we<00:03:33.710> get<00:03:33.830> two<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.040> these<00:03:34.280> as<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.760> just<00:03:35.000> saw<00:03:35.240> so

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
we get two of these as you just saw so

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.890 
we get two of these as you just saw so
let's<00:03:36.320> go<00:03:36.440> ahead<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.620> move<00:03:36.770> on<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> actual

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
let's go ahead and move on to the actual

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.130 
let's go ahead and move on to the actual
build<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.380> set<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.060> here<00:03:41.720> we<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:41.990> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
build of the set and here we have the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.120 
build of the set and here we have the
main<00:03:42.320> build<00:03:42.650> as<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.190> see<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.520> is<00:03:43.640> a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
main build as you can see it is a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.590 
main build as you can see it is a
four-legged<00:03:46.690> defensive<00:03:47.690> canon<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.410> some<00:03:48.710> sort

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
four-legged defensive canon of some sort

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.910 
four-legged defensive canon of some sort
let<00:03:50.600> me<00:03:50.720> know<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.080> comments<00:03:51.530> below<00:03:51.560> if<00:03:51.770> you

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
let me know in the comments below if you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.250 
let me know in the comments below if you
know<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.190> exact<00:03:52.550> name<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.840> see<00:03:54.080> has

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
know the exact name so you can see has

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.040 
know the exact name so you can see has
this<00:03:54.830> little<00:03:55.040> bit<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> rotation<00:03:56.120> here<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
this little bit of rotation here and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.160 
this little bit of rotation here and
then<00:03:57.590> this<00:03:57.770> button<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.840> releases<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.870> flick

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
then this button here releases a flick

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.200 
then this button here releases a flick
fire<00:04:00.350> missile<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.980> really<00:04:01.520> like<00:04:01.670> how<00:04:01.820> they<00:04:02.000> put

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
fire missile I really like how they put

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.630 
fire missile I really like how they put
that<00:04:02.360> underneath<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.590> actual<00:04:03.980> cannon<00:04:04.430> head

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
that underneath the actual cannon head

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.180 
that underneath the actual cannon head
so<00:04:05.180> it<00:04:05.210> kind<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.480> gives<00:04:05.600> that<00:04:05.810> illusion<00:04:05.900> net<00:04:06.410> it

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
so it kind of gives that illusion net it

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.650 
so it kind of gives that illusion net it
is<00:04:07.400> firing<00:04:07.670> out<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.030> here<00:04:08.740> very<00:04:09.740> cool<00:04:10.660> little

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
is firing out of here very cool little

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.630 
is firing out of here very cool little
piece<00:04:11.930> there's<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.740> little<00:04:12.860> bit<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.190> support

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
piece there's a little bit of a support

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.220 
piece there's a little bit of a support
piece<00:04:13.820> under<00:04:14.210> here<00:04:14.390> which<00:04:14.510> is<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.660> clear<00:04:14.990> piece

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
piece under here which is a clear piece

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.979 
piece under here which is a clear piece
so<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.590> kind<00:04:15.800> of<00:04:15.890> gives<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.540> look<00:04:17.540> that<00:04:17.570> it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
so it kind of gives it that look that it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.720 
so it kind of gives it that look that it
is<00:04:18.200> actually<00:04:18.500> standing<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.190> all<00:04:19.400> four<00:04:19.700> legs

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
is actually standing on all four legs

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.720 
is actually standing on all four legs
when<00:04:20.270> in<00:04:20.390> fact<00:04:20.500> these<00:04:21.500> are<00:04:21.950> barely<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:22.700> the

when in fact these are barely on the
