00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
and making it try to tell us what was

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.569 
and making it try to tell us what was
going<00:00:56.690> through<00:00:56.930> your<00:00:57.079> mind<00:00:57.199> at<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:57.890> time

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
going through your mind at that time

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.039 
going through your mind at that time
aside<00:00:59.000> from<00:00:59.030> get<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.780> off<00:00:59.870> me<00:01:02.049> rationally

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
aside from get it off me rationally

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.740 
aside from get it off me rationally
think<00:01:03.320> while<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.309> was<00:01:04.399> happening<00:01:04.519> at<00:01:05.059> all<00:01:05.239> when

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
think while it was happening at all when

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.180 
think while it was happening at all when
I<00:01:05.780> look<00:01:05.990> at<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.380> goes<00:01:06.680> pretty<00:01:06.890> quickly

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
I look at that it goes pretty quickly

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.999 
I look at that it goes pretty quickly
but<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.820> can<00:01:08.539> process<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:09.170> quite<00:01:09.440> slowly<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
but I can process it quite slowly in it

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.830 
but I can process it quite slowly in it
felt<00:01:10.159> like<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.399> went<00:01:10.490> really<00:01:10.640> slowly<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.179> from

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
felt like it went really slowly I from

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.960 
felt like it went really slowly I from
going<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.860> jab<00:01:13.070> him<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.369> eyeball<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:13.819> my

and coming up and going back down and
all<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.679> sudden<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.979> was<00:01:25.130> free<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.490> just

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
all of a sudden I was free and just

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.490 
all of a sudden I was free and just
trying<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.300> swim<00:01:26.509> for<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.780> safety<00:01:27.050> button

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
trying to swim for that safety button

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.529 
trying to swim for that safety button
seeing<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.250> my<00:01:28.310> wetsuit<00:01:28.580> finished<00:01:29.210> at<00:01:29.390> there

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
seeing that my wetsuit finished at there

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.130 
seeing that my wetsuit finished at there
but<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.050> so<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.759> can<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:31.909> remember<00:01:32.450> pretty<00:01:32.929> much

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
but then so I can I remember pretty much

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.109 
but then so I can I remember pretty much
all<00:01:33.319> of<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:33.830> there's<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.429> few<00:01:34.610> blank<00:01:34.819> spots

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
all of it but there's a few blank spots

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:35.910 
all of it but there's a few blank spots
where<00:01:35.299> plastic

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
where plastic

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.350 
where plastic
did<00:01:36.920> lose<00:01:37.159> your<00:01:37.369> leg<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.880> part<00:01:38.119> of<00:01:38.210> your

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
did lose your leg and and part of your

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.059 
did lose your leg and and part of your
arm<00:01:38.509> but<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.659> look<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.110> incredibly<00:01:39.679> strong

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
arm but you look so incredibly strong

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.760 
arm but you look so incredibly strong
now<00:01:40.250> how<00:01:40.759> hard<00:01:40.970> was<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.209> right<00:01:41.479> back<00:01:41.770> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
now how hard was that right back it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.040 
now how hard was that right back it
wasn't<00:01:43.039> easy<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:43.459> the<00:01:44.149> years<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.929> I<00:01:44.989> spent

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
wasn't easy but the years that I spent

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.290 
wasn't easy but the years that I spent

in the military you learn how to process

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.729 
in the military you learn how to process
painting<00:01:47.599> you<00:01:47.840> know<00:01:47.989> how<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.170> push<00:01:48.410> through<00:01:48.590> it

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:48.739
