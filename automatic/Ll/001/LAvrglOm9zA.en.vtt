00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 the dragon photos debuted in the glass of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.839
 Portugal with an expressive victory 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.580
 about the sport of the squad for 48 and 61 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.480
 with this result the team becomes 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.480
 next stage of the competition 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.449
 to him and rodrigo around everyone be the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 dragonforce name is always in portugal 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 I think the Roberto school cost 200 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.740
 those commanded by John to create a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.750
 complicated story you'd have to call 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.440
 a difference in tone help the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 club that was in the lead at the end of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.900
 first room the end of everything 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.270
 the cold the coach demanded the maximum 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.970
 attention and the film was identical to the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.820
 first room for stronger tracks 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.700
 pilot a clear 1934 advantage over the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.680
 favorable trend towards the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.570
 formation of dragons continues in their 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 fourth time when FC Porto goals 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.309
 maintained a good collective game and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 competitive aggressiveness, which 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.430
 was translated into a three-point advantage 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 34 47 the entrance to the cold 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.800
 the offensive behavior of the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 John of air looked like thunder and always 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 which accelerated the number of points 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 increased scoring will be the most difficult to 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.460
 get part of the copy team too 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.340
 time since wearing with greater wear 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.250
 in the final minutes the team of the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 home still ran away but victory did not run away 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.039
 to the theme of force at the end 4861 and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.720
 next stage of the third pillar for the 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.580
 coach joão that the team of 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 basketball braga and lighthouse is having good 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.390
 levels of income and to provide 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.390
 póvoa the results achieved in varzim 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.049
 the not so flashy kind of game the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.509
 delete god pt was the beginning and created a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.380
 Some problem, I think, was a lot 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.359
 good 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 clearly perceived an objective that 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.829
 I have with the game stayed with the port. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.399
 in competitions to win is they do 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.799
 part of a new project that I intend to 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.780
 ovaries with Portuguese at a higher level 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.670
 high in terms of competitions here in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.920
 portugal and has conquered right now 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.660
 always desiring to win is not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.879
 which I did not accept without first but as the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 information but you have the weight of being the 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.670
 most representative team at the moment 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.900
 comfort 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 I think it 's very good, it's a team that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 has suffered a lot since the first year 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 I think that understanding a spy of god 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.090
 for a very very 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.940
 interesting and that allows us to believe 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.799
 that what the goal we have 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.599
 in this project which is the fastest 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.280
 possible to reach a condition the 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.799
 most important competitions in 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 other years is trying to be mistaken 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.790
 Also to be as fast as possible 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.959
 still not satisfied with the ball without 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.049
 these results the event is the first 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.340
 game that we have in official terms and not 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.019
 could be more satisfied with the team 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.030
 but older than that of a standard cnb1 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.650
 have some level use much more games 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.040
 experienced guess what I spend here 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.269
 training we had a good response with 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.269
 end does not do door
