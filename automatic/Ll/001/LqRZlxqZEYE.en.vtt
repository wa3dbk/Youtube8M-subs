00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
so what I decided I'm going to be doing

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
so what I decided I'm going to be doing
is<00:00:32.520> creating<00:00:32.790> these<00:00:33.300> funny<00:00:33.840> characters<00:00:34.440> that

I think would make good Sims and giving
them<00:00:36.840> traits<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.350> personalities<00:00:38.070> based<00:00:38.340> on

those before the next episode the first

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
those before the next episode the first
thing<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.240> had<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.600> obviously<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
thing I had to do obviously was make the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
thing I had to do obviously was make the
green<00:01:13.920> skin<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.909> something<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> think

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
green skin that's something that I think

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
green skin that's something that I think
the<00:01:15.570> sims<00:01:15.780> 4<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.290> does<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> great<00:01:16.890> job

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the sims 4 actually does a great job

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.010 
the sims 4 actually does a great job
they<00:01:17.520> give<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> green<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> blue

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
they give you the green and the blue

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.649 
they give you the green and the blue
skin<00:01:19.439> tones<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.280> they're<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.549> overly<00:01:21.390> green

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
skin tones but they're not overly green

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
skin tones but they're not overly green
and<00:01:21.869> overly<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:22.979> blue<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.400> look<00:01:23.640> like

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

what<00:01:24.509> blue<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.200> green<00:01:25.439> skin<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:25.979> like

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
what blue or green skin would look like

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
what blue or green skin would look like
in<00:01:26.460> my<00:01:26.580> opinion<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.240> that's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.810> great<00:01:28.020> feature

you can't adjust them without the use of
mods<00:02:00.750> which<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.530> good<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:01.920> your

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
look proportional and the nose feature

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.050 
look proportional and the nose feature
is<00:02:10.200> actually<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.679> improvement<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.550> my<00:02:11.700> opinion

over<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.489> sims<00:02:59.760> 3<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.540> me<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.989> does<00:03:01.379> feel

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
over the sims 3 and to me it does feel

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.800 
over the sims 3 and to me it does feel
like<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.040> downgrade<00:03:02.730> now<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.569> mainly

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
like a downgrade now this is mainly

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
like a downgrade now this is mainly
because<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.410> can't<00:03:04.709> actually<00:03:04.980> customize

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
because you can't actually customize

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.170 
because you can't actually customize
what<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.660> Sims<00:03:06.959> characters<00:03:07.650> are<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.370> wearing

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
what the Sims characters are and wearing

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.789 
what the Sims characters are and wearing
as<00:03:09.329> far<00:03:09.569> as<00:03:09.720> materials<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.440> t-shirt<00:03:10.769> you

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
as far as materials on the t-shirt you

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.770 
as far as materials on the t-shirt you
can<00:03:11.040> change<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.489> color<00:03:11.730> schemes<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.450> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
can change the color schemes and you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.470 
can change the color schemes and you
have<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> few<00:03:13.560> options<00:03:13.640> but<00:03:14.640> nowhere<00:03:15.060> near<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
have a few options but nowhere near the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.479 
have a few options but nowhere near the
amount<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.019> options<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> had<00:03:16.889> when<00:03:17.459> you

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
amount of options that you had when you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.110 
amount of options that you had when you
were<00:03:17.639> playing<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.599> actual<00:03:19.099> sims<00:03:20.099> 4<00:03:20.489> or

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
were playing in the actual sims 4 or

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.210 
were playing in the actual sims 4 or
this<00:03:21.299> actual<00:03:21.720> Sims<00:03:21.959> 3<00:03:22.260> game<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.769> was<00:03:22.919> just<00:03:23.069> it's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
this actual Sims 3 game it was just it's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.309 
this actual Sims 3 game it was just it's
a<00:03:23.310> lot<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.760> night<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.030> day<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> did

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
a lot it's night and day really I did

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.629 
a lot it's night and day really I did
notice<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> difference<00:03:25.980> right<00:03:26.130> away<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
notice the difference right away and

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.000 
notice the difference right away and
after<00:03:27.269> playing<00:03:27.630> with<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.290> say<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.769> does

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
after playing with it I can say it does

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
after playing with it I can say it does
feel<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.489> downgrade<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.000> that's<00:03:30.299> kind<00:03:30.569> of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
feel like a downgrade so that's kind of

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.159 
feel like a downgrade so that's kind of
a<00:03:30.720> downside

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
a downside

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.289 
a downside
in<00:03:31.500> all<00:03:31.769> honesty<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> sims<00:03:32.730> 3<00:03:32.819> I<00:03:33.000> probably

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
in all honesty in the sims 3 I probably

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.300 
in all honesty in the sims 3 I probably
been<00:03:33.630> able<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> create<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.290> better<00:03:34.590> outfit<00:03:35.040> for

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
been able to create a better outfit for

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.099 
been able to create a better outfit for
Shrek<00:03:35.609> but<00:03:36.209> because<00:03:36.599> we're<00:03:36.780> stuck<00:03:36.959> playing

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
Shrek but because we're stuck playing

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.920 
Shrek but because we're stuck playing
Sims<00:03:37.560> 4<00:03:37.799> lucky<00:03:38.489> us<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:39.120> get<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.599> make<00:03:39.780> our

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
Sims 4 lucky us we get to make our

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.080 
Sims 4 lucky us we get to make our
outfit<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.889> bit<00:03:41.010> lackluster<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:41.760> in

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
outfit a little bit lackluster but in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.280 
outfit a little bit lackluster but in
all<00:03:42.209> honesty<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> think<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.139> something

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
all honesty I think this is something

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050 
all honesty I think this is something
that<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.620> improve<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.220> probably<00:03:44.849> will

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that can improve and probably will

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.449 
that can improve and probably will
improve<00:03:45.780> when<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.500> expansion<00:03:47.040> packs<00:03:47.250> come

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
improve when the expansion packs come

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.740 
improve when the expansion packs come
out<00:03:47.579> because<00:03:47.849> with<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.060> expansion<00:03:48.569> packs

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
out because with the expansion packs

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.960 
out because with the expansion packs
will<00:03:49.169> come<00:03:49.380> new<00:03:49.530> outfits<00:03:50.040> new<00:03:50.280> clothing<00:03:50.579> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
will come new outfits new clothing and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.360 
will come new outfits new clothing and
overall<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.870> better<00:03:52.200> experience<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:53.130> my

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
overall a better experience in my

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.650 
overall a better experience in my
opinion<00:03:53.400> we'll<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.209> wait<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.540> on

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
opinion we'll have to wait and see on

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.629 
opinion we'll have to wait and see on
that<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.959> guess<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.349> jury's<00:03:55.680> still<00:03:55.709> out<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.519> in

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
that I guess the jury's still out but in

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.670 
that I guess the jury's still out but in
my<00:03:56.790> opinion<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.480> downgrade<00:03:58.019> but<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.500> can

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
my opinion it is a downgrade but it can

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680 
my opinion it is a downgrade but it can
be<00:03:58.859> fixed<00:03:59.129> now<00:03:59.669> you'll<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.239> here<00:04:00.480> I'm<00:04:00.660> just
