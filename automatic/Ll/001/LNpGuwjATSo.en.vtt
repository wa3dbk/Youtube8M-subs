00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
tailgate so I'm going to be replacing

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.440 
tailgate so I'm going to be replacing
those<00:02:30.540> six<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> half's<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.350> well

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.849 

right<00:02:35.450> here<00:02:35.719> is<00:02:35.900> where<00:02:36.079> that<00:02:36.409> when<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> open

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
right here is where that when you open

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.530 
right here is where that when you open
the<00:02:36.950> tailgate<00:02:37.099> there's<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.609> handle<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.299> hangs

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the tailgate there's a handle that hangs

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.649 
the tailgate there's a handle that hangs
down<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.519> has<00:02:40.639> a<00:02:40.670> 10<00:02:40.939> millimeter<00:02:41.150> bolt

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
down and that has a 10 millimeter bolt

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.869 
down and that has a 10 millimeter bolt
in<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:43.099> there's<00:02:43.219> a<00:02:43.280> piece<00:02:43.459> of<00:02:43.489> plastic

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
in it I think there's a piece of plastic

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.009 
in it I think there's a piece of plastic
that<00:02:43.939> covers<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.329> you<00:02:44.540> might<00:02:44.629> need<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> just

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
that covers it you might need to just

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.989 
that covers it you might need to just
pop<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.349> plastic<00:02:45.739> off<00:02:45.889> and<00:02:46.189> then<00:02:46.340> remove<00:02:46.849> that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:46.999 
pop the plastic off and then remove that

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.879 
pop the plastic off and then remove that
10<00:02:47.239> millimeter<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:47.900> then<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.319> rest<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.829> just

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
10 millimeter and then the rest is just

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.660 
10 millimeter and then the rest is just
held<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.430> by<00:02:49.609> these<00:02:50.420> little<00:02:50.750> white<00:02:50.930> clips<00:02:51.670> I'm
