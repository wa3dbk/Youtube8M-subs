button<00:06:23.880> it<00:06:24.360> will<00:06:24.419> take<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.960> snapshot<00:06:28.460> see<00:06:30.350> it

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
button it will take the snapshot see it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.170 
button it will take the snapshot see it
will<00:06:31.530> take<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:31.949> snapshot<00:06:32.430> energy<00:06:32.850> before

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
will take the snapshot energy before

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.280 
will take the snapshot energy before
mine<00:06:33.360> so<00:06:34.260> how<00:06:34.560> easily<00:06:34.949> we<00:06:35.930> interface<00:06:36.930> the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
mine so how easily we interface the

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.580 
mine so how easily we interface the
MATLAB<00:06:37.970> we<00:06:38.970> throat<00:06:39.449> with<00:06:40.260> Proteus<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:42.590> using

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
MATLAB we throat with Proteus and using

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.550 
MATLAB we throat with Proteus and using
the<00:06:43.710> MATLAB<00:06:43.979> gie<00:06:44.639> we<00:06:45.419> just<00:06:45.660> interface<00:06:46.290> our

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
the MATLAB gie we just interface our

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.920 
the MATLAB gie we just interface our
webcam<00:06:47.430> wheat<00:06:48.360> or<00:06:49.250> microcontroller<00:06:50.250> we<00:06:50.580> get

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
webcam wheat or microcontroller we get

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.620 
webcam wheat or microcontroller we get
16<00:06:51.930> AP<00:06:52.229> devil<00:06:52.590> 7<00:06:52.919> and<00:06:53.130> we<00:06:53.760> can<00:06:53.940> use<00:06:54.270> this

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
16 AP devil 7 and we can use this

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.620 
16 AP devil 7 and we can use this
project<00:06:54.990> in<00:06:55.830> our<00:06:56.130> home<00:06:56.460> security<00:06:56.790> system<00:06:57.360> if

project in our home security system if
the<00:06:58.470> input<00:06:59.010> here<00:06:59.430> we<00:06:59.669> use<00:06:59.940> the<00:07:00.270> two<00:07:00.450> switches

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
the input here we use the two switches

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.170 
the input here we use the two switches
to<00:07:01.320> switches<00:07:01.889> rather<00:07:02.310> using<00:07:02.850> the<00:07:02.970> push

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
to switches rather using the push

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.960 
to switches rather using the push
switches<00:07:03.690> if<00:07:04.350> we<00:07:04.530> use<00:07:04.860> the<00:07:05.100> motion<00:07:05.460> sensor

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
switches if we use the motion sensor

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.779 
switches if we use the motion sensor
then<00:07:06.510> it<00:07:06.810> will<00:07:07.080> when<00:07:07.380> any<00:07:07.680> motion<00:07:08.160> in<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.580> room

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
then it will when any motion in the room

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.450 
then it will when any motion in the room
is<00:07:09.090> detected<00:07:09.660> by<00:07:09.690> the<00:07:09.870> motion<00:07:10.260> sensor<00:07:10.680> it<00:07:11.310> will
