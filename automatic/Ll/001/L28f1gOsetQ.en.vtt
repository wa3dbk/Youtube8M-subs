00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
nerd or a nostalgia critic and I think

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.670 
nerd or a nostalgia critic and I think
that's<00:03:53.700> pretty<00:03:53.880> good<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.630> when<00:03:55.560> you

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that's pretty good you know when you

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's pretty good you know when you
always<00:03:56.160> when<00:03:56.579> he's<00:03:56.670> down<00:03:56.819> tries<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.599> a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
always when he's down tries that a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.030 
always when he's down tries that a
little<00:03:57.930> more<00:03:57.989> subtlety<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.890> know

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
little more subtlety to it you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800 
little more subtlety to it you know
sometimes<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.549> look<00:03:59.730> just<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.510> touch<00:04:00.660> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
sometimes a look just a touch of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.620 
sometimes a look just a touch of
subtlety<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.670> think<00:04:02.670> nothing<00:04:03.120> works<00:04:03.420> pretty

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
subtlety I think nothing works pretty

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.759 
subtlety I think nothing works pretty
