00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 problem 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.299
 good evening dear friends 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.400
 we are again the center of the Catholic University of Campobasso 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.109
 we have seen the treatment of tumors today as a major specialty 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.820
 piroweb climbing skills 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 we are here to talk about female tumors of the anus tumors 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.169
 with professor gabriella ferrandina director of the operational unit 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.929
 complex of surgery oops 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.210
 Good evening tonight 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.800
 the oncological surgery which is the characteristic of this discipline 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.020
 therefore it is 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.300
 discipline over time 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.539
 it has been enriched with various aspects and needs 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.430
 by force 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.480
 of a multidisciplinary approach 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.530
 we have the good fortune of working in this 190 which uses not only 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.710
 in the year of gynecological oncology of different values ​​of different 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.690
 professionalism 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.629
 but too enjoy it too 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.140
 of the presence of different skills 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.750
 beta outside of it 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.810
 and in this case 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.360
 operating the oncology department 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 we have the possibility the big advantage 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.799
 to be able to use the hill deeeeeee surgeons oncologists 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.460
 don't consider therapists 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.890
 we have the possibility of having the entire department of 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.800
 then imagine you can help us in the preoperative part and 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.100
 also in the treatment of high patients of our patients 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.740
 we have a pathological anatomy service available that can 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.260
 certainly biofire affinity of skills especially one available 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 available to which are not found 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 and in a ubiquitous manner 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.210
 this work my notice allows you to 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.570
 to approach the romania patient and strangely global 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.990
 which assesses early diagnosis and even screening programs 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.360
 accompanies all the diagnostic processes accompanying the neck that will be 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.490
 the crucial moment that therapeutic moment is above all 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 and it is about 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.020
 honda sector we buy motorcycles 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.850
 g continue to follow the patient eeeh also all that will be afterwards 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.700
 surgery 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.620
 this makes treatments and lasting 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.200
 in rescue treatments I refer to that month of the second foot e 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 of others and accompanied me even in the most advanced phases in the morning 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.210
 that unfortunately some patients are still found although obviously and in 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.690
 an ever smaller number of homes in anti-technological advancements even at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.360
 I believe that the acquisition of skills in this regard is the approach 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.760
 global to a patient and in general I refer of course also pathologies 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.379
 other types of oncology but 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.319
 obviously in this case of gynecological pathologies 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.890
 and critical why 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.430
 it's the patient they are waterproof 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.300
 extremely fragile as gynecological neoplasms can be 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300
 characterized by the fact of 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:03:00.279
 represent belen poetry mandala involve an apparatus speak with 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.029
 turn 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.179
 and I acquire organs that a beautiful woman 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.829
 let's say some features 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.189
 surely their predominance 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.279
 marcatissimo 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.369
 and this in the menu with a special touch 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.449
 lol allows me to open a small parenthesis on the fact that 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.350
 although gynecological neoplasms tend to fundus put on rather advanced 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.960
 there is however a small fraction of these neoplasms that also occurs 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.680
 in very young women and in this case as you can imagine what it may be 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.960
 the repercussion 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.520
 of surgical and non-surgical treatments on fertility and then on 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.550
 ability to procreate that for a woman constitute the element how to say 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.390
 identifier proper of the beauty of the fortress 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.440
 so in this sense I believe that being inserted is a structure like 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.639
 this 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.480
 to those who operate in Italy 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.039
 gynecological oncology 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.949
 a benefit is a not insignificant advantage 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.130
 we talked about woman's cancer but how cancer is cancer 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.819
 which most commonly affect women 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.859
 well surely you mean incidence 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.970
 the most frequent tumor in the field of pathologies 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.880
 let's say boom boom of a collage and gynecology consisting of carcinoma 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.749
 uterus 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.319
 the carcinoma of the body of the known uterus is particularly involved 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.609
 also as an endometrial carcinoma it is a very frequent madness that hangs 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.340
 to produce mostly - quite advanced though 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.500
 a quota is not to be overlooked. with just under 5% is found 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.639
 also impatient under 40 years 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.720
 it is a pathology for me, fortunately not being 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:36.800
 let's say 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.770
 the most common tends to be characterized by the clinical course 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.729
 rather favorable and this because compared to other neoplasias 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.509
 is a wave in the presentation mode allows you to make a 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.229
 relatively early enough diagnosis in fact 70 75 percent of the 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.289
 Tumors of the body of the uterus is diagnosed at the stage 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.310
 photo 1 stage first wedge of illness 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.699
 this is fundamental 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.620
 why 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.080
 good thing our house proposal 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.009
 it is possible to treat this neoplasm definitively with 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.219
 a simple intervention that glitters 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.379
 so we have all the proxy proxy gestures your heart has made 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.849
 er register doctors recognized in time then how does a woman make the lady 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.860
 let's say not very young to understand when the signals are 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.759
 the body 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.759
 well that symptom is a pretty symptom 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.069
 striking is easily recognizable 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.449
 and there is genital bleeding 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:44.059
 and the fact that it is called oooh to occur we say mostly to the in phase 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.680
 post menopausal and when there is in the woman 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.009
 menopause has been reached and consequently has come - what 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.240
 the normal ovarian cycle and menstrual cycle 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.790
 phrases that such symptom 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.020
 I can not go over paolo because it occurs in a phase 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.150
 temporal life of the woman in which there are no should not be there 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.790
 more blood loss at the vaginal level is therefore a symptom easily 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.160
 recognizable that the woman usually rude climate rally does not have to 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.169
 to neglect 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.750
 and cheneil and then push the patient oviparous center for the family around 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:17.630
 to the license 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.259
 to proceed immediately a saw diagnostic tests 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:24.259
 first of all certainly a pelvic ultrasound 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.689
 preferably, fiat elica transvaginally will be investigated not 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:30.619
 invasive 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:35.779
 % is easily can be followed basically any outpatient clinic 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:36.690
 any 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.770
 the unit 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.560
 in any hospital race department that already allows for 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.990
 particularly useful information 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.580
 in order to then address the patient later 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.250
 who to follow other diagnostic investigations a little more sophisticated but 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.840
 evidently also a little in Brazil as an example of hysteroscopy also 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.650
 hysteroscopy an investigation that they followed well 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.149
 already allows dieting ages 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.149
 and the data on histopathological diagnosis 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.899
 once upon a time it is essential that the patient does it 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:11.139
 ask about the structures 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.789
 specialized. donate it again j gynaecol today the land for appropriate care 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.399
 well 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.359
 We cannot exhaust the subject of the phytocomplex and vasco here 

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.930
 today an appeal for the early diagnosis of women 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.699
 that somehow they must know how to recognize the symptoms that the body of 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.039
 data must absolutely not be ashamed 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.710
 we will return the doctor ferrandina who thank piazza passion 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.680
 we will deepen the theme further 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.389
 thanks to all of you and good evening
