00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.710
 what stood out in his team 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.780
 nothing unusual a few nice things I said that at nec 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.950
 it at Haarlem 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.950
 people asked 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.959
 small pieces often work 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.959
 and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.579
 and every point was in the food 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.769
 yes i'm just too 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.029
 that dexia got done by three meter artists 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.550
 and you will certainly hear that workshop more 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.950
 that is something that she can do with it in the netherlands 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.100
 every so often and from next year 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.160
 during 50 euros before and afterwards you can spend 50 euros on products 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 actually 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 does it cost you a mix of eta members, I kind of say 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 purchase obligation of 50 euros 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 but if your own show was so pinging about buying, then you should do a workshop 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.840
 for example a very nice way to use your product 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.560
 You can make that index a new product that actually means there 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.020
 to experience it once he quickly became, but then I don't go too much now 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.170
 This is the hit title hit 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.380
 for all with what that is x 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.430
 you can do better than the certainly at 4 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.280
 watch the coming days 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.190
 chapeau 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.930
 and who are in each case permanently fighting a 25 percent discount on Paul Ricard 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.680
 and that goes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 not used 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 he leaves he offers falls 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.900
 and he gets offers 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.800
 that's a bottle 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.860
 in this special 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.920
 and in a flat 70 but there you go and look 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.500
 sit here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.430
 at berkenbeek tennis 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.570
 after then 500,000 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.660
 in the direction 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.980
 and I want to do this for a while from kieft 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.050
 6 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.260
 27 euros and 10 cents for a bottle marked 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.740
 July 13 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.620
 it is that is 8 is fixed 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.749
 but now it's 50 percent coming 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:13.749
 discounts and cost efficiency of 3 percent was this field of view hours 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.560
 it is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.209
 Schiphol 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.700
 So you have a bit of interest 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.949
 pearce on can 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.479
 with a little bit 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.329
 the spectrum 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.329
 but very little needed at a time 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.139
 with black screens 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.849
 no he is it is here 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.809
 and it gives a nice he seems very draws in 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.149
 you're so nice 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.909
 this nice and creamy say 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.289
 You can see this well on that 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.109
 that is the review error 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.360
 these cost the shed a friend 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.829
 narrowly win over 33 set, after which they now have 27 euros 10 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.829
 and therefore claim a 50 percent discount for each other again 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.789
 take your pick if you haven't done anything there 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.019
 I want to be new but I am very happy with it 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.019
 let's just put that over again a bouncer 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.599
 that says nicolas house 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.819
 the technical to stay 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.819
 the number of points 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 but yeah 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.739
 the cyclists 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.089

 and that's a suzy with 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.289
 the 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.929
 however, I will still find it back 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.279
 The day you know buying in a concert hall is so much fun that they do 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.299

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.769
 just because it is now still in the way so close in spring top also chance 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.849

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.580
 I am very curious about this because 9 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.029
 combo test in the store 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.330
 surrounded with color 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
 we are curious to try it out 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.819
 not happy 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.550

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.589
 I'm going to fix it 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.610
 I found it there 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.889
 I have 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.990
 his favorite device m 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.990
 his ball 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.120
 a report for myself 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
 in from palliative participation 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.270
 and I liked that smell 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.979
 it's a new line of discussion in the philippines 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.719
 was with 52 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.499
 among other things a bargain 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.219
 and a 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:05.159
 Yes 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.029
 so five falls in a short time 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:10.169
 and all that reduced to a record number 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.189
 important 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.860
 after lunch on the elysée 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.879
 had bought bought 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.589
 this is the 239 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.189
 it is a flat release street douglas 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.969
 when you see 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.159
 and this top time sister used up and here I am very happy I am already one 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.159
 for a while i thought yes i would like to try it sometime 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.930
 the third Pascal curious but I thought 28 28 pounds as expensive as you 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.730
 do it yourself 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.730
 7 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.229
 26 out 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.809
 that's right 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.789
 56 yet I am very, very expensive 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:48.770
 a brush 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.449
 I'm also sure people say it according to the newspaper 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.520
 anyway i have tried it not really super fan of it 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.930
 and he is good at and for example also the blender bit sweeping 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.690
 but also yes he is very nice to also divorce or just 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.599
 good to pick up and good to convey to your eye know that brings one 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.219
 gone but signs amen 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:13.619
 and who brushes a base 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:16.619
 what we now know that it will be a really big favorite 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.400
 so yes i'm just very happy with this 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.809
 he is worth the money 

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.809
 if you want to see a review seems strange to me of course 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:32.069
 at super soft 

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:36.249
 and this at the stock exchange a correction whip in 2007 had to state that 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.349
 classical itself 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.939
 that's how i was 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:44.379
 that was actually just provided it was 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:47.379
 I have I was just very heinen combination 

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.169
 I think so 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.120
 the offer can then the coffee shop on from today for sale I like it 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.490

 soon I have not indicated that I want to return 

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:05.969
 the newspaper 

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:08.259
 patty brard x 

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:11.580
 for amd 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.969
 and then the top
