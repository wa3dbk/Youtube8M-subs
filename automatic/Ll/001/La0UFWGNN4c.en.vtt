our<00:05:58.490> destination<00:05:59.210> you<00:05:59.599> know<00:05:59.719> we<00:05:59.870> can<00:06:00.020> really

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
our destination you know we can really

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.939

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
open string which is a great way to seem

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.709 
open string which is a great way to seem
like<00:06:07.099> you're<00:06:07.430> paying<00:06:07.639> twice<00:06:07.969> as<00:06:08.180> fast<00:06:08.389> as<00:06:08.689> you

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
like you're paying twice as fast as you
