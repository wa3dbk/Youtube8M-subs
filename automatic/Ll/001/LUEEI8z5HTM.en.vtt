00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi friends state lately we 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.620
 very carried away with you books and quite 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.840
 forgot about the video and board games 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.780
 and this is not good because we are theirs too 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.700
 very love and so today 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 I want to kill also two birds with one stone 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 say about five on drains which 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.490
 received embodiment in electronic 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 format you can play them not only on 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.400
 desktop but also on your pc or tablet i 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 I'll warn you, this is not top 5, it's just 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.320
 those games about which I want 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320
 to tell 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.100
 and we begin with the legendary 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.730
 unique and gorgeous game space 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 hulk 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.410
 from the world of warhammer 40,000 first edition 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.360
 the game came out already in the eighty-ninth year 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.550
 during this time the game is low 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.680
 reprinted but always limited 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.770
 copies but now it is but so far and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.989
 everyone can play it and need it 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.239
 make it tactical cooperative 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.379
 a game that talks about five 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.480
 Space Marines who land on 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.100
 space station and try for 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.710
 clean it of tyranids 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.200
 lots of tactics good atmosphere and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.330
 warhammer 40,000 favorite world 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:18.520
 what else do you need the game burns great once 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.520
 sometimes you want beavers 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 learning from teams 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.280
 but if you don’t want anyone 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.220
 shoot not to kill anyone but want 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.170
 something good and light for 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.360
 I have you ticket to ride 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 still on board game which i am very 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.430
 I love and do not miss the opportunity once 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 once and not to mention it for real 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.260
 Excellent kind euro game which 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.750
 will let you 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.640
 gird the entire globe with iron 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 roads in the same with them can be bought and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.790
 bases all the main content if you like 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.500
 to play on the desktop on pkt this is mast hev a 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.500
 everything is implemented very cool 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 but also included this list 1 game rather 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.170
 with minus than plus is a sign 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.690
 the ancients many times I say that this 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.120
 very simple understand you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.600
 atmospheric cooperative amelie thrash me 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.210
 like it but the electronic version is not very 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.090
 just because of one detail you can play 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.010
 both on pc and on tablets very well 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.230
 implemented in terms of graphics 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.570
 intuitive gameplay is simple 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.090
 great but they didn't add 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.310
 multiplayer is a huge miscalculation which 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.950
 I meet from time to time I don't understand 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.220
 than the developers it causes the same 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.170
 the very game is a risk game obsolete to me 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 really like it but the principle of sitting with 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.610
 online friends could be 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.840
 quite fun but not online and playing 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.600
 only against bye 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.970
 the fact that it is much less interesting than 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.010
 play with real people but i think 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.050
 therefore it is not necessary to explain to me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.980
 the sign conveyed the disappointment of all because 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.290
 one detail 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.060
 but if for you it doesn’t matter 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.000
 you are not going to play with mates 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.280
 well enough of yourself loved you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.680
 in order to overcome evil, I basically 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.060
 tips because basically the game is very 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.060
 and very good 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:25.490
 and pretty funny that board games 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.470
 on pc from some primitive browsers 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.210
 rooted in fairly large projects and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.080
 even adapted to the format 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.350
 free-to-play 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.810
 for example the game memoirs 44 it is downloaded 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.330
 Steam has the ability to base mission 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.150
 play for free that is allies 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.250
 against the Germans if you like it you can 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.440
 pay and i have that very good format 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.720
 because you are real marshal try 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.820
 and if you like the top and why not 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.040
 fork out the same game great she 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.920
 Already earned a reputation offline 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.840
 see nastolki so normal old 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.210
 quenching in wargame in the game quite a lot 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.030
 variations of playing fields have your army 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.500
 there is an enemy army 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.620
 move use orders and 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.110
 lots and lots of dice, in principle, I 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.720
 I can follow you at least too 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.110
 just get familiar with the free base 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.110
 version 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.680
 and the last game that became for me 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.320
 called a real discovery on hat 20 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.900
 or laser game pharaoh for exactly such 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.150
 title came out in Russia and published 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.340
 company star and i didn't play 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.680
 it is here in the desktop because in 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.870
 principle of abstract games do not really like 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.880
 but literally the day before yesterday I received a letter 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.910
 from game developers 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.640
 it is the computer version we say 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.950
 online appeared on look here you two 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.200
 the key as a gift can you tell me from 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.720
 I do not refuse a freebie I think I could have 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.000
 click to see launched and was in 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.910
 utter delight 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.580
 not a single game before for a very long time 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.510
 on moans or computer did not throw me 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.610
 such a call 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.220
 most of all this is a game like chess 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.950
 there, too, there are fields of different shapes only 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.500
 the rule is simpler than in chess and there 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.960
 there is a laser and every player has fins 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.060
 and after your turn he releases the laser 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.830
 which is reflected from the mirror of others 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.590
 figures and then either go outside 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.560
 fields either falls into any figure 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.180
 in non reflective surface this is a figure 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.310
 there is a task to build such 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.680
 the combination that the balager got into pharaoh 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.840
 the opponent and then he leaves 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.640
 and you win I needed 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.370
 literally 5 minutes after the start of the first 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.950
 batches to figure out what goes around 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.860
 how is what happens but to win 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.290
 you need to strain according to feelings 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.050
 in real life, like chess, that is, and you look 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.720
 how does your laser fly like a laser opponent 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.730
 flies where does that your opponent 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.830
 do have to build some 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.930
 ingenious combination of game requires at 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.700
 you always be on your toes when 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.860
 not to go key I launched straight 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.010
 broadcast and it was probably the most 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.990
 uninteresting stream for all time let's say 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.820
 games too hartstone I can about something 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.180
 tell read comments 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.210
 then I just sat and thought 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.180
 because a lot of combination the game requires 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.180
 maximum concentration and it's awesome 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.289
 but I already let it out that I got two 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:37.839
 key and so I have no problem one of 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.939
 let's play them let's do it 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:42.309
 small contest you need to be super in 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.979
 VKontakte I think without that it was 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:50.080
 need to do a long time ago and do 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.819
 repost a message with this here video 6 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.269
 April we will choose one winner 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:57.789
 who will receive the game as a gift and be able to 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:07:01.119
 play with me and kick my asses 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:04.539
 although I am a good opponent keep in mind well 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.259
 and this is all natural, this is absolutely 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.229
 a little bit 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:10.329
 from what comes out in electronic 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.639
 The format on the tablets on the PC 

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:15.579
 Now, board games like mushrooms after 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:18.129
 summer rain appear on electronic 

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.499
 devices and that's fine so what we to 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:23.050
 This topic has certainly return and on 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:25.929
 don't forget to put likes on this yet 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.939
 subscribe and see you soon soon 

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:29.939
 be cool gods
