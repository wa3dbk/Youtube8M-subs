00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
riding on the other side too overall the

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.470 
riding on the other side too overall the
soft<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:52.120> pretty<00:02:52.720> nice<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:54.480> really

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
soft was pretty nice I really

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.580 
soft was pretty nice I really
disappointed<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.560> me<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:58.510> part<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.350> it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
disappointed in me this part here it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.059 
disappointed in me this part here it
seemed<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.100> clump<00:03:00.670> up<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.000> lot<00:03:01.859> fabric<00:03:02.859> back

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
seemed to clump up a lot fabric back

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.729 
seemed to clump up a lot fabric back
here<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:04.630> sure<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.019> sock<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
here so not sure if the sock is going to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.949 
here so not sure if the sock is going to
last<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.160> long<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.730> heel<00:03:07.030> portion<00:03:07.269> you

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
last that long on the heel portion you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.370 
last that long on the heel portion you
can<00:03:08.049> see<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.750> after<00:03:10.959> one

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
can see that that was just after one

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.500 
can see that that was just after one
where<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.100> see<00:03:12.340> how<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.549> materials<00:03:13.209> kind

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
where you can see how the materials kind

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.819 
where you can see how the materials kind
of<00:03:13.630> already<00:03:14.609> snagged<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.790> lot<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.470> i'm<00:03:17.590> not<00:03:17.769> sure

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
of already snagged a lot so i'm not sure

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.220 
of already snagged a lot so i'm not sure
if<00:03:18.069> they'll<00:03:18.220> last<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.670> long<00:03:18.819> but<00:03:19.180> did<00:03:19.930> enjoy

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
if they'll last that long but did enjoy

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.400 
if they'll last that long but did enjoy
wearing<00:03:20.500> them<00:03:20.799> i<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:22.690> heard<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.019> they

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
wearing them i have heard that they

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.140 
wearing them i have heard that they
don't<00:03:23.620> work<00:03:23.799> too<00:03:24.040> well<00:03:24.069> with<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.549> shoes<00:03:24.819> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
don't work too well with the shoes and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.390 
don't work too well with the shoes and
the<00:03:25.180> reason<00:03:25.600> is<00:03:25.780> they<00:03:26.560> tend<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.950> slide<00:03:27.220> around

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the reason is they tend to slide around

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.660 
the reason is they tend to slide around
a<00:03:27.730> lot<00:03:27.910> because<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:29.280> bottom<00:03:30.280> pattern

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
a lot because of this bottom pattern

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.449 
a lot because of this bottom pattern
here<00:03:30.910> when<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.150> look<00:03:31.329> at<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.630> material<00:03:32.459> it's

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
here when you look at this material it's

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.250 
here when you look at this material it's
different<00:03:33.819> than<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.209> rest<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.660> sake<00:03:34.959> of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
different than the rest of the sake of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.069 
different than the rest of the sake of
the<00:03:35.500> soft<00:03:35.769> part<00:03:36.069> meaning<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.900> it's

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
the soft part meaning of this and it's

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.599 
the soft part meaning of this and it's
ribbed<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.799> i<00:03:38.920> can<00:03:39.100> see<00:03:39.280> how<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.579> might

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
ribbed and i can see how that might

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.559 
ribbed and i can see how that might
slide<00:03:40.180> around<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.720> shoe<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:41.920> lot<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.280> people

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
slide around the shoe so a lot of people

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.890 
slide around the shoe so a lot of people
in<00:03:43.829> Nightwing's<00:03:44.829> review<00:03:45.340> he<00:03:46.209> said<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.690> he

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
in Nightwing's review he said that he

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.509 
in Nightwing's review he said that he
had<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.260> play<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.950> different<00:03:48.069> pair<00:03:48.430> of

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
had to play with the different pair of

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.059 
had to play with the different pair of
socks<00:03:48.760> which<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.180> kind<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.480> weird<00:03:50.069> considering

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
socks which is kind of weird considering

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.250 
socks which is kind of weird considering
these<00:03:51.280> should<00:03:51.609> go<00:03:51.849> with<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.269> shoes<00:03:55.260> anything

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
these should go with the shoes anything

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.530 
these should go with the shoes anything
else<00:03:56.440> about<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.859> socks<00:03:57.160> that's<00:03:58.120> pretty<00:03:58.420> much

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
else about the socks that's pretty much

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.470 
else about the socks that's pretty much
it<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.980> just<00:04:00.190> for<00:04:00.220> casual<00:04:00.730> use<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:01.150> think

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480
