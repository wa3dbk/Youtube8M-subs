00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 hello how many things already exposed 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.340
 millennia and also did not return this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.860
 in the only one before the holidays however 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.410
 so long and it seems strange to me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.050
 this first video computer with those 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 hair does nothing enough i'm 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.500
 continuously the voyeur other than me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 I have to make eye on a fringe I know 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 for those seeing it for this once 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.710
 video since there are so many new ones 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.830
 subscribers god greeting and I thank the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.500
 welcome to this tremendous crazy fool 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.559
 channel are practically e.on 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.629
 which, however, concern only chief things 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 of clothing accessories that I 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.250
 they are sent by the companies with which 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.110
 decided to work together because not all of them 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 I accept them not all with one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.710
 carmen and so I always try to be 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 as honest as possible about the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.219
 my experience of course then maybe 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.079
 someone else's bad second though I have 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 lent as I am and in any case 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.379
 this video was born with the intent 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.359
 mainly to give you ideas 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.160
 because obviously they are all things chosen 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.750
 with my taste to my personal taste from 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 these sites made arrested though if 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 premise because it lacked so much inside 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.020
 I know that this video always follows me 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.850
 makes us two balls to see and hear me 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.340
 but to say these things for those who have registered 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 from few of the new can always area 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.590
 wondering what the hell I'm doing here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 begin immediately commence on the blue sail 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.570
 he has been working with for a long time now 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 time and it's all things of that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.909
 obviously I have chosen things already for 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 autumn is winter because it is useless 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.610
 still buy 9 short-sleeved when 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.950
 among some jules the sky for those 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 climate changes that are there every two hours 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.830
 looks like we're in the rainforest 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 in Italy, however, now there is September 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.560
 we are starting from the leather jacket that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.480
 it has a sand-colored front 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.110
 light brown and then the part 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.270
 instead of black leather look sleeves 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 obviously it is very very nice because it is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.180
 nice heavy is not light 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.780
 obviously it's not winter climate 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 Christmassy 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.180
 but here for the autumn it is just fine 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.160
 nice nice warm as it may be 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.959
 carlo a sheath here are the hinges are 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.610
 perfect without defects really in the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.290
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 wear it another thing I took 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 which implied a lot since this year 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 they will wear as much as everyone else 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.440
 friends to say on a novelty indeed vi 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.870
 advance that trend video 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.970
 autumn winter 2014 the official one 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.130
 the one in which I tell you everything also about 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 hair I will talk about all the trends that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.440
 obviously we have seen so far 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.280
 on the catwalks and already in the shops 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.900
 here to peek the peach and mango dinners 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 etc 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.610
 I'll tell you about it in the next video 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.670
 I believe I will load them but I don't want to say 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.070
 but invite the neighbor and he has 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.220
 this chosen practically this 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.709
 cream and long cardigan e 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.840
 asymmetrical then on the front and more 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.120
 short then it goes down longer and longer 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.280
 on the shoulders of the collaboration in 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.610
 lace so it's transparent you see 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.320
 what you have below in this case is 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.630
 preferable nicer makes the come 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 so little skin for this period that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.470
 you can afford to show the 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.440
 skin soon we will embark like 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 Eskimos and nobody circulates anymore 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.690
 behind the hats and scarves are the eyes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.970
 type arabs and dulcis in fundo these 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.000
 boots 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.550
 Leatherette Ankle always with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.080
 the heel however not thin wide 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.760
 even if heels will also be worn 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.030
 much wider you will find find the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.340
 Classical taccone Bellolampo and have 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.620
 however the plateau that makes them that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
 make it as is the heel is also 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.240
 quite tall but with plateau and heel 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.780
 big I am really comfortable I assure you 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.530
 passers precisely in metal and therefore 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.440
 they go right to Milan to intersect the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.490
 passers-by and are proper to the combat bulls 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.250
 I try the heel 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.680
 ok i pass to another site that i love it 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810
 you know it's stuff is the first in many 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.400
 they have gold and this little game because 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.990
 he sees us that he has not done on instagram 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.880
 all my contacts are always in 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.100
 infobox as well as all the things that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.100
 shows all the links are in the info box 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.419
 here that this jacket in style like 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.880
 I can say college with aj styles and all 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:29.330
 how much blue with only the sleeves 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.400
 white to classic with a bed in style 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.250
 college as well as closure see that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.980
 these buttons at the elastic also below 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.169
 and on the sleeves and I love it is 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.060
 in vacation really soft soft 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.980
 the detail of the soft is also 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.479
 pockets is worth for which it is always in the 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.640
 same fabric in the same motif 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.100
 of the elastic under the aforementioned axis 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.380
 pockets really well made the buttons 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.210
 they close well they don't jump is another 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.160
 which they don't see wearing because it is 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.010
 a little too early, at the very least 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.740
 down here from me is this whole sweater 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.840
 pure white warm but with all of it 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.660
 the plot you see inside made in 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.169
 this way and is slightly perforated e 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.860
 a light dinner sweater 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.870
 Heavy wool is really thin so 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.229
 is fine just for the fall and Roma 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.150
 to free shipping so whether or not I have 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.139
 changed it seems to me that he put three 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.029
 dollars that is diener euro and 50 for the 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.819
 steiner expeditions, however, very little 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:30.129
 however, I am always well prepared because 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.620
 the photos reflect the products there are 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.419
 tables with cm sizes are difficult 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:41.169
 therefore wrong italy concludes instead 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:43.389
 shoes are sneakers 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.419
 However, the commerce model is not original 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.669
 as kimi are legally equal 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.460
 act not de corato a girl who 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:53.409
 combines a facebook page in the inter 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.520
 swatch practically where decoder yes 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.249
 also sell dinners including clothing 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.759
 but mainly the particular thing 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:03.990
 that she chooses the shoes she is 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:07.360
 obviously always with your advice 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.110
 what you want to do you paint them a 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.210
 gradually point by point is 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.560
 these shoes are practically here 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.960
 very special sneakers and 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.819
 you have to love the kind that have the logo 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.550
 of the pink floyd of veiling of the jeans 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:31.060
 who knows knows of what I speak and of 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.699
 the whole line of beats are a 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.649
 beautiful thought and whatever it does 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.199
 know every genre visited his 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:41.110
 facebook page veiling in the limbo box 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:43.779
 so go see something too 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.569
 fate and making hand created 80 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.509

 in the new damage there is no end 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.750
