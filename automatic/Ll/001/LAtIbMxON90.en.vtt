what's<00:00:07.170> unique<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.340> exciting<00:00:08.610> about<00:00:08.850> the

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.060 
what's unique and exciting about the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.910 
what's unique and exciting about the
mville<00:00:09.300> meeting<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.680> hand<00:00:10.800> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
mville meeting is on the one hand the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.590 
mville meeting is on the one hand the
breadth<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.370> topics<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.000> covered<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.480> as

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
breadth of topics that are covered it as

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.090 
breadth of topics that are covered it as
few<00:00:12.809> meetings<00:00:13.020> that<00:00:13.290> really<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:13.920> same

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
few meetings that really have the same

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.580 
few meetings that really have the same
scope<00:00:14.760> as<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> emblem<00:00:15.389> eating<00:00:15.629> but<00:00:16.260> also<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
scope as the emblem eating but also the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
scope as the emblem eating but also the
very<00:00:16.770> high<00:00:16.920> quality<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.700> science<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
very high quality of the science and the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
very high quality of the science and the
speak<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.860> is<00:00:19.980> present<00:00:20.190> that<00:00:20.490> are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
speak is that is present that are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.160 
speak is that is present that are
presenting<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.360> so<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> great

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
presenting that and so it's a great

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.530 
presenting that and so it's a great
opportunity<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:23.760> meet<00:00:23.940> with<00:00:23.970> people<00:00:24.420> outside

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540

make<00:00:35.129> these<00:00:35.340> connections

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.170 

for<00:00:41.830> me<00:00:41.950> what's<00:00:42.160> really<00:00:42.310> exciting<00:00:42.550> about<00:00:42.910> this

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
for me what's really exciting about this

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.730 
for me what's really exciting about this
particular<00:00:43.630> meeting<00:00:43.900> not<00:00:44.170> just<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> fact

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
particular meeting not just the fact

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.410 
particular meeting not just the fact
that<00:00:44.800> it's<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.100> Vienna<00:00:45.370> but<00:00:45.610> but<00:00:45.910> it's<00:00:46.060> also<00:00:46.240> a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
that it's in Vienna but but it's also a

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.720 
that it's in Vienna but but it's also a
meeting<00:00:46.900> which<00:00:47.280> neuroscience<00:00:48.280> which<00:00:48.430> is<00:00:48.580> not

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
meeting which neuroscience which is not

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.120 
meeting which neuroscience which is not
traditionally<00:00:49.540> been<00:00:49.660> one<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.140> stronger

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
traditionally been one of the stronger

traditionally been one of the stronger
areas<00:00:51.430> within<00:00:51.640> embo<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.210> really<00:00:52.570> very<00:00:52.720> well

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
areas within embo is really very well

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.130 
areas within embo is really very well
represented<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.680> as<00:00:53.770> a<00:00:53.800> fantastic<00:00:54.840> lineup<00:00:55.840> of

and<00:01:08.530> there's<00:01:08.740> really<00:01:08.920> exciting<00:01:09.550> development

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
and there's really exciting development

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.520 
and there's really exciting development
in<00:01:10.119> neuroscience<00:01:10.690> now<00:01:10.840> where<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.170> tools<00:01:11.380> of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
in neuroscience now where the tools of

five<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.520> these<00:01:18.790> speakers<00:01:19.180> are<00:01:19.240> really<00:01:19.540> tiny

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
five of these speakers are really tiny

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.630 
five of these speakers are really tiny
is<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.259> field<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:20.860> for<00:01:21.220> me<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.490> going

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
is in that field so this for me is going

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.100 
is in that field so this for me is going
to<00:01:21.820> be<00:01:21.970> one<00:01:22.119> of<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.300> great<00:01:22.479> highlights<00:01:22.869> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
to be one of the great highlights of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.880 
to be one of the great highlights of
this<00:01:23.680> meeting

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710 

well<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.490> advice<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> young<00:01:30.210> researchers

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
well my advice to the young researchers

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.750 
well my advice to the young researchers
attending<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.260> meeting<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:32.159> course<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
attending the meeting of course not just

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.280 
attending the meeting of course not just
to<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.300> much<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> sciences<00:01:34.110> as

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
to take in as much of the sciences as

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
to take in as much of the sciences as
you<00:01:34.380> possibly<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.159> also<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.520> take

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you possibly can but also to take

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.260 
you possibly can but also to take
advantage<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.770> possibilities<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
advantage of the possibilities there to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
advantage of the possibilities there to
meet<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.510> scientists<00:01:40.350> outside<00:01:40.800> your<00:01:41.010> own

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
meet with scientists outside your own

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
meet with scientists outside your own
field<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.810> emboar

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
field and this is one thing that emboar

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
field and this is one thing that emboar
does<00:01:43.350> extremely<00:01:43.650> well<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.250> meetings<00:01:44.430> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
does extremely well at these meetings is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
does extremely well at these meetings is
organizing<00:01:45.840> networking<00:01:46.410> activities<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.610> so

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
organizing networking activities and so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
organizing networking activities and so
go<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> those<00:01:48.450> lunches<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> meet<00:01:49.500> to
