Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu,
Innal hamda lillah wassalatu wassalamu ala

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.610
rasoolillah. My dear respected learners and
viewers today I will be teaching one of the

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.610
important Duaa which is call Sana we may call
it Subhanaka. In this video I will read this

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:30.339
duaa part by part. So you can practice with
me easily InshaaAllah. End of the video I

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.490
will read whole Duaa together, so you can
practice it again InshaaAllah. So when we

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.930
need to perform our five times prayer or any
additional prayer, we need to recite this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.760
Duaa at the begging of our Salah after Takbeeratut
Tahreema and before Suratul Fatiha. It is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.330
stated in many hadith, our beloved prophet
Sallallahu alaihi wasallam recited this duaa

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.550
at the beginning of His prayer. So we should
learn this duaa perfectly. So without going

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.550
any further let's get started. MashaaAllah
you have practiced with me nicely. Well done!

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.250
Now I'm going to recite the whole duaa together,
so can practice it again with me InshaaAllah.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.729
MashaaAlah we have practice this duaa together.
So I hope it does help you to learn this Duaa.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.960
My dear learners, I will be making some others
Duaa video which we recite in our daily prayer.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.079

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.609
