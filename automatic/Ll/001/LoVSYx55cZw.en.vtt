00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.820
 let's make old clothes if you do not want 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.500
 miss any of my videos 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.500
 subscribe to the channel we started 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.789
 and the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.570
 are the remains of the cooked a couple of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 large and ripe tomatoes streaked a garlic 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.360
 and a finely chopped medium onion and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 olive oil first thing we're going to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 to do is to make the sofrito of the vegetable 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.269
 we have put a pan to the fire to fire 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 strong with olive oil and wait 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.890
 to warm up once we have been 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.339
 warmed the oil we will be first the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.339
 onion 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.320
 we will lower the fire to the minimum 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 so that we leave for changes 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 We'll also take the agito stung by a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.040
 once it has cost us a little bit the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.040
 onion and garlic let's take the tomato 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.659
 and we will raise the fire to the maximum we will be 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.649
 a little salt 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.859
 and let the cold tomato let 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.960
 to try to see if it's good salt 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.479
 because we're just going to throw salt at 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.939
 tomato because the remaining ingredients 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.250
 they all have salt because they are remains like 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.649
 I said the cooked is fine salt 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.509
 but the tomato is a bit acidic 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.810
 let's take half a teaspoon of 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.810
 sugar 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.149
 once we have removed the acidity 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.909
 to the tomato 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.310
 let's go throwing the ingredients that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.130
 we are missing let's start throwing the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 meat that you see is the meat that we 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.329
 has remained at the veal pit 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.209
 ham sausage will miss the potato the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.579
 chorizo and finally we will throw the 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.469
 chickpeas we do not move much so that 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.929
 the chickpeas are broken because 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.840
 they are cooked they do not have to cost 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 just mix the taste of the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.470
 garlic onion and everything else we are going to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.450
 try to see if it's all good salt and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.569
 it's perfect so we already have it 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.060
 recipe as you see is to take advantage of everything 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.280
 what's left of the stew because 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.590
 we always miss everything that we 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.170
 it is cooked we put it together we make a 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.629
 sofrito and we put everything together and that's what 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.599
 we call old clothes because we already have 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.879
