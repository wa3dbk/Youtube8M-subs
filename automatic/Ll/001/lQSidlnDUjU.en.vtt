00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.679
 Hello, people, I'm guiding you 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.849
 today we are going to learn to raise any 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.849
 number squared 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.579
 will serve us mainly for 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:31.770
 do calculations on how to take root 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:36.290
 square without a calculator 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.290
 this is to be used specifically in 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 econometrics 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 more specific would be theorem of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 Pythagoras where there are times that then 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 it complicates us because we do not have 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.970
 calculator for example in the exams 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.970
 of pizza or opposition to enter the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.430
 university or high school too to 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.520
 high school and we do not have the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 necessary tools then 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.780
 This is the first step 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 and then we 'll do it the other way 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 let's start 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.060
 first let's raise 43 squared 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.360
 let's take the 4 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.450
 we square that would be 4 by 4 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.680
 16 now we take the 3 would be 3 by 39 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.670
 but what what in two figures so 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.790
 so I'm going to put him 09 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 Now I'm going to multiply 4 times 3 and I'm going 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.630
 to double 4 times 3 is 12 and double 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.630
 would be 24 we accommodate it from the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 tens 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 and we would be 1849 what can verify 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 in a calculator you like 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:12.500
 very well another number 53 squared 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.500
 5 x 5 25 and 3 x 39 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.810
 5 is now 3 15 and 32 would be double 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.810
 1809 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.099
 another number would be 60 and 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.099
 7 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.840
 6 x 6 would be 36 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.879
 7 x 7 49 and now 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.920
 6 x 7 42 the double 84 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 which leaves us 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.460
 4 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.340
 489 4.489 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.740
 another number from 72 squared would be 7 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.640
 for 7 49 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:25.610
 and 2 for 2 4 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.610
 7 for 2 14 and the double would be 28 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.719
 5,184 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.590
 and finally 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.480
 on the 30th and 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.400
 38 squared 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.400
 it would be 3 x 3 9 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:57.900
 8 x 8 64 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.900
 3 x 8 24 the double would be 48 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.050
 then I have left 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.959
 4 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.959
 4 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.290
 41 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.400
 1,444 very well 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.110
 in this way we can save some 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.400
 seconds maybe minutes 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.719
 to be able to multiply quickly if 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.419
 liked the video subscribe is like 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:43.120
 recommend the word pass if you do not 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.120
 I liked it so much thanks so much
