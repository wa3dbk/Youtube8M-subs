00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.219
 We continue the theme but independence 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:03.840
 Doll 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.009
 fuel selection 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.959
 its location 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.299
 arrangement 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.239
 fuel selection is paramount 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.369
 supply system 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.330
 your home depends on this factor 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.020
 will your house be warm 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.720
 can you enough 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.089
 secure the boiling water 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.980
 able to pay itar tass 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.130
 heating system such as boiler under 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.770
 this type of fuel you will need to do and 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.869
 hid 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.280
 but it will require one-time reinforce or 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.289
 yours yours 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.280
 this is question number two 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.609
 the first question 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.689
 will supply and secure rub 

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.390
 romance flow 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.550
 firstly in my opinion you don't need to be 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 dependencies are not on one of them 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.350
 in my case it's class 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 and in principle about the state behind him on 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 pay now 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.640
 but above from the window it tries it 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.900
 calorie and rising prices 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.890
 made me switch to heating 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.570
 firewood 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.310
 plans factor is the world price 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.520
 in Ukraine the price from year to year already 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.200
 approaching in the first indicators 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.010
 I do not know how in Russia for the next 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950
 gas price increase Ukraine always 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.390
 comes before the heating season 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.860
 for me it is this uncertainty 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 Smagulov I fully pay the couple 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.969
 order 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.439
 or subsequently with her debts with which 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.889
 anyway do not have to 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:23.910
 pay off 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.600
 and prompted the switch to fuel volumes 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.820
 which is not limited 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.240
 these are ordinary dried stumps from pasata butts 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.520
 caloric content of this fuel is somewhat 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.620
 lower than normal matter but possible 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.420
 fix this fuel as much as you need 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.670
 is the main side advantage 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.689
 I did not clean the gas boiler and I have it 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.990
 working condition 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.149
 although pay a little for gas 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.480
 firewood signs cost 5 5 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.380
 and dependence on Kazan 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.719
 I personally believe that those people who are already 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.200
 Now you can pay for the order 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.659
 can find such fuels sits 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.320
 will take into account running all year round 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.040
 of course you need to take it into account 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.070
 calorie 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.720
 but still guide cycle about 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.560
 accessibility 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.310
 it could be a churn 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220
 sadko brought piluna birds 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.429
 sawmill 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.419
 or just dump where to throw 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.399
 parties 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.439
 list and waste felicita plants 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.310
 oil or fuel oil rush 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.779
 and tact 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.639
 ways to ensure the warmth of the masses 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.629
 on this site you will find 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.819
 the cats you liked 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.209
 almost like this and go about 5 of any 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.540
 smoothly it will decide on 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.430
 calorie table fuel 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.309
 different kinds 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.219
 you can read 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.289
 point two 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.459
 when you have decided on the choice of fuel 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.779
 choose a place for then kidney 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.549
 if your flue is in a coma even 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.869
 when will it be a separate room 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.749
 then we can easily escape 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.639
 heat loss previous video 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.649
 looked at how to squeeze all the heat is not 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:56.979
 asked how 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.179
 if it is a separate astana 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.709
 all hope will be good for your efficiency 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.139
 heat days 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.329
 if it be water of course or 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.379
 it is necessary to warm the corpses with the flow 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.329
 hot water to make mini heating mains 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.679
 this time opportunities minimum heat loss 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.609
 if you serve fire 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.729
 even waiting for the shelves but the air of water and 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.719
 started building heat loss will 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.409
 much bigger 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.629
 exactly necessary transition if she 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.869
 is tons 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.989
 for delivery and loading is about the floor 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.919
 quite an important point the way of delivery 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.219
 furnace fuel for example pod 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.149
 the seeds are low calorie fuel it 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.299
 need a large number 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.079
 other cases it is also desirable 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.289
 proton pm 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.099
 it is also desirable to have a separate entrance 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.879
 if high ash fuel is needed 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.749
 constantly cleaning the boiler 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.949
 and you called for example 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.369
 coal waste heaps 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.129
 theater dust may contain 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.989
 a large amount of sulfur the same group 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.879
 but this does not mean that the fuel is low 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.389
 quality and calorie 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.029
 must be refused 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.359
 sooner or later this fuel will have 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.309
 use like the other just don't 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.099
 will be 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.149
 must also take into account the fact 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.759
 fuel toxicity in this case but 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.169
 only such substances to be bored 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.979
 furnace settles days 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.159
 dwellings if it is highly toxic 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.239
 fuel it is better to refuse 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.560
 for today everything was with you was yury kolesnik 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.699
 meet you next sight about 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.800
 creating the first conditions of 5 arena 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.650
 fuel three main conditions
