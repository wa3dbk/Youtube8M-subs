a<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:02.940> while<00:01:03.030> ago<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> Xbox<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.870> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a little while ago on the Xbox and it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
a little while ago on the Xbox and it's
terrible<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
terrible on that so do you think that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.950 
terrible on that so do you think that
developers<00:01:06.150> should<00:01:06.180> should<00:01:06.540> even<00:01:06.689> really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
developers should should even really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
developers should should even really
bother<00:01:07.170> putting<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.860> games<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.670> mostly

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
bother putting them in games I mostly

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.270 
bother putting them in games I mostly
agree<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.960> him<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
agree with him I I think that it can

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
agree with him I I think that it can
become<00:01:11.490> too<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.880> distraction<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
become too much for distraction for the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
become too much for distraction for the
main<00:01:12.840> story<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.830> III<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.729> really

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
main story but III don't really

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
main story but III don't really
necessarily<00:01:15.689> shouldn't<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
necessarily shouldn't be there or that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.440 
necessarily shouldn't be there or that
they<00:01:17.159> can't<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.549> executed<00:01:17.939> properly<00:01:18.060> they

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
they can't be executed properly they

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
they can't be executed properly they
should<00:01:18.600> might<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.350> David<00:01:19.680> said<00:01:19.830> well<00:01:19.950> but

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
should might be like David said well but

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.410 
should might be like David said well but
kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> game<00:01:20.610> aspect<00:01:20.820> having<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> figure

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750 
maybe they need to work on them as a
whole<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.500> they're<00:02:34.860> they're<00:02:35.520> probably

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
awkward as too hard video games so it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.740 
awkward as too hard video games so it's
just<00:02:40.230> something<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.560> work<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> whole
