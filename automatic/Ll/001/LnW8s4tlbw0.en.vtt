tutorial on how to take care of your
headphones<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.440> not<00:00:07.710> have<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.069> buy<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.220> new

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
headphones and not have to buy a new

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.720 
headphones and not have to buy a new
pair<00:00:08.639> every<00:00:08.940> other<00:00:09.059> week<00:00:09.559> I<00:00:10.559> guess<00:00:11.490> I'm<00:00:11.610> gonna

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
pair every other week I guess I'm gonna

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
pair every other week I guess I'm gonna
start<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.450> soon<00:00:12.630> as<00:00:12.750> possible<00:00:13.429> first<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.610> all

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
start as soon as possible first of all

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.740 
start as soon as possible first of all
don't<00:00:15.750> drop<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.590> headphones<00:00:17.250> don't<00:00:18.240> drag

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
don't drop your headphones don't drag

don't drop your headphones don't drag
them<00:00:18.960> behind<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.529> because<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.400> will<00:00:20.520> cause

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
them behind you because that will cause

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.609 
them behind you because that will cause
the<00:00:21.029> speaker's<00:00:21.630> inside<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> shake<00:00:22.350> around

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the speaker's inside the shake around

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
the speaker's inside the shake around
and<00:00:22.830> fall<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:24.199> I<00:00:25.199> mean<00:00:26.039> nobody<00:00:26.670> wants<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and fall out and I mean nobody wants to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359 
and fall out and I mean nobody wants to
walk<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.199> shaky<00:00:28.710> headphones<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
walk around with shaky headphones you

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.179 
walk around with shaky headphones you
know<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> base<00:00:31.050> full<00:00:31.320> song<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
know when you have a base full song and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.610 
know when you have a base full song and
it<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.270> starts<00:00:33.510> rattling<00:00:33.960> you're<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.440> oh

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it just starts rattling you're like oh

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
it just starts rattling you're like oh
my<00:00:34.770> god<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.430> need<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.899> fun<00:00:37.079> zone

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
my god I need some don't have fun zone

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.069 
my god I need some don't have fun zone
and<00:00:38.390> second<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.629> don't<00:00:41.840> wrap<00:00:42.840> your

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and second of all don't wrap your

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
and second of all don't wrap your
headphones<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.399> go<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
headphones up when you're about to go to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.770 
headphones up when you're about to go to
sleep<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.559> that<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.360> short<00:00:48.360> circuits

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
sleep because that just short circuits

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.569 
sleep because that just short circuits
them<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:51.050> every<00:00:52.050> day

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
them like if you do this every day

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.160 
them like if you do this every day
that'll<00:00:53.579> cause<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.820> circuits<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> wires

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that'll cause the circuits and the wires

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
that'll cause the circuits and the wires
to<00:00:55.530> bounce<00:00:55.829> back<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.329> corrode

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to bounce back and that will corrode

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
to bounce back and that will corrode
inside<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> wires<00:00:58.859> inside<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> coding

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
inside of the wires inside of the coding

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.990 
inside of the wires inside of the coding
and<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> won't<00:01:01.590> notice<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.460> mean<00:01:02.550> all

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and you won't notice it but I mean all

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
and you won't notice it but I mean all
your<00:01:03.300> wires<00:01:03.480> wires<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.379> fried<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
your wires wires would be fried and you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
your wires wires would be fried and you
wouldn't<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.159> notice<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.390> way<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
wouldn't even notice the only way to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
wouldn't even notice the only way to
repair<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> type<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.890> funs

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
repair that is the type that have funs

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.600 
repair that is the type that have funs
open<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:09.229> wires<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.560> cost<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.070> much<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
open and by wires that cost as much as a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.120 
open and by wires that cost as much as a
new<00:01:11.760> pair<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> headphones<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
new pair of headphones if not more and I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
new pair of headphones if not more and I
don't<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.580> worth<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.890> second<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
don't think it's worth it and second of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
don't think it's worth it and second of
all<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.580> yank<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.850> headphones<00:01:21.390> out

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
all is not to yank your headphones out

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.929 
all is not to yank your headphones out
don't<00:01:22.380> pull<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.100> instantly<00:01:23.640> because

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
don't pull them out instantly because

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
don't pull them out instantly because
that<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:24.750> cause<00:01:25.159> like<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> leverage<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that will cause like the leverage on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.969 
that will cause like the leverage on
this<00:01:29.000> 3.5<00:01:30.000> millimeter<00:01:30.270> jack<00:01:30.799> it'll<00:01:31.799> cause

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this 3.5 millimeter jack it'll cause

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.520 
this 3.5 millimeter jack it'll cause
that<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> wiggle<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.939> bit<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.509> you'll<00:01:34.200> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that the wiggle a bit and then you'll be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
that the wiggle a bit and then you'll be
one<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> those<00:01:34.860> people<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.460> turn<00:01:35.729> there

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
one of those people have to turn there

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.030 
one of those people have to turn there
jack<00:01:36.810> every<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.590> plug<00:01:37.829> their

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
jack every time they plug their

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
jack every time they plug their
headphones<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> music<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.320> go

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
headphones in to get the music to go

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.649 
headphones in to get the music to go
through<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.000> um<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:43.530> top<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
through and um on top of all of that

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.480 
through and um on top of all of that
don't<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.530> headphones<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
don't all your headphones up to the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.010 
don't all your headphones up to the
point<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:47.880> you'll<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:50.630> untangle<00:01:51.630> them

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
point where you'll have to untangle them

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
point where you'll have to untangle them
because<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.710> mean<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> best<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
because I mean the best way to do it is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.770 
because I mean the best way to do it is
to<00:01:54.439> throw<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.770> neck<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
to throw them over your neck like this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
to throw them over your neck like this
because<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.560> gives<00:01:58.710> them<00:01:58.920> free<00:01:59.490> room<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
because that gives them free room and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.789 
because that gives them free room and
they're<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.630> balled<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they're not balled up you don't have to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.999 
they're not balled up you don't have to
worry<00:02:01.950> about<00:02:02.100> tangling<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.530> they're<00:02:04.530> at

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
worry about tangling them and they're at

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.800
