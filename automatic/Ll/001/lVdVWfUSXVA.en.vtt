basic things so you need to know that in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.240 
basic things so you need to know that in
order<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.110> body<00:00:40.290> grow<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.980> need<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
order to make your body grow you need to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.940 
order to make your body grow you need to
provide<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.640> body<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.910> more<00:00:42.300> energy<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
provide your body with more energy and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.350 
provide your body with more energy and
energy<00:00:43.950> comes<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> form<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> calories

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
energy comes in a form of calories

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
energy comes in a form of calories
therefore<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.410> order<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.829> provide<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.550> body

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
therefore in order to provide your body

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
therefore in order to provide your body
with<00:00:47.820> enough<00:00:48.180> energy<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> increase

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with enough energy you need to increase

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
with enough energy you need to increase
your<00:00:49.680> daily<00:00:49.800> caloric<00:00:50.280> intake<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.510> make<00:00:51.660> your

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
your daily caloric intake to make your

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.380 
your daily caloric intake to make your
body<00:00:51.960> grow<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.890> secondly<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.910> also<00:00:53.940> need<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
body grow so secondly you also need to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.490 
body grow so secondly you also need to
make<00:00:54.539> sure<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> provide<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.410> body

make sure that you provide your body
with<00:00:55.680> enough<00:00:55.980> proteins<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.820> proteins

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
with enough proteins because proteins

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.700 
with enough proteins because proteins
are<00:00:57.449> building<00:00:57.719> blocks<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.079> everything<00:00:58.440> within

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
are building blocks of everything within

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
are building blocks of everything within
your<00:00:58.920> body<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.609> hair<00:00:59.879> your<00:01:00.180> skin<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.660> most

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
your body your hair your skin and most

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
your body your hair your skin and most
importantly<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.530> muscle<00:01:01.829> tissue<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
importantly your muscle tissue if you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.950 
importantly your muscle tissue if you
want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> make<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.149> muscles<00:01:03.329> grow<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.840> need

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
want to make your muscles grow you need

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
want to make your muscles grow you need
to<00:01:04.080> pry<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.320> muscles<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.890> enough<00:01:05.100> building

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to pry your muscles with enough building

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
to pry your muscles with enough building
material<00:01:05.820> therefore<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.570> need<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> increase

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
material therefore you need to increase

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
material therefore you need to increase
the<00:01:07.380> amount<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.650> proteins<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.460> sue<00:01:08.670> per

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the amount of proteins you can sue per

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.660 
the amount of proteins you can sue per
day<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.750> finally<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.950> order<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.400> stimulate

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
day so finally in order to stimulate

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
day so finally in order to stimulate
muscle<00:01:12.210> growth<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.600> need<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> train<00:01:13.110> hard<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
muscle growth you need to train hard and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
muscle growth you need to train hard and
you<00:01:13.770> need<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> let<00:01:14.220> heavy<00:01:14.460> energy<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.810> do

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you need to let heavy energy and to do

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.149 
you need to let heavy energy and to do
so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> need<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> improve<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> efficiency

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so you need to improve the efficiency

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.420 
so you need to improve the efficiency
efficiency<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.540> ATP<00:01:19.080> PC<00:01:19.650> energy<00:01:20.100> system

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
efficiency of your ATP PC energy system

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
efficiency of your ATP PC energy system
so<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.479> explain<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> minute

on and the first supplement I want to
talk<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:27.630> weight<00:01:28.320> gainers<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
talk with you about weight gainers and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
talk with you about weight gainers and
weight<00:01:29.640> gainers<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.150> great<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.509> they're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
weight gainers are great because they're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.109 
weight gainers are great because they're
not<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.320> expensive<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.520> opinion<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
not so expensive and in my opinion this

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.940 
not so expensive and in my opinion this
is<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> best<00:01:33.420> supplement<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.470> guy<00:01:34.650> who's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
is the best supplement and you guy who's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
is the best supplement and you guy who's
just<00:01:34.979> starting<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:36.030> pick<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
just starting out can pick up in the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.749 
just starting out can pick up in the
store<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.100> no<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
store so basically there's no need to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.859 
store so basically there's no need to
overthink<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
overthink there's no need to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.289 
overthink there's no need to
overcomplicate<00:01:40.229> stuff<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.670> basically<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
overcomplicate stuff but basically in a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
overcomplicate stuff but basically in a
nutshell<00:01:42.479> where<00:01:42.960> weight<00:01:43.290> gainers<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.860> packed

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
nutshell where weight gainers are packed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
nutshell where weight gainers are packed
with<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.610> calories<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> said

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
with a lot of calories like I said

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.719 
with a lot of calories like I said
earlier<00:01:46.049> calories<00:01:46.530> plied<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:47.070> our<00:01:47.280> bodies

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
earlier calories plied about our bodies

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
earlier calories plied about our bodies
with<00:01:47.939> energy<00:01:48.299> which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> needed<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.110> our

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
with energy which is needed to make our

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
with energy which is needed to make our
bodies<00:01:49.619> grow<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> also<00:01:50.700> weight<00:01:51.509> gainers

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
bodies grow and also weight gainers

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
bodies grow and also weight gainers
contain<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> complex<00:01:52.890> carbohydrates

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
contain a lot of complex carbohydrates

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
contain a lot of complex carbohydrates
and<00:01:53.790> why<00:01:54.390> do<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.930> contain<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> complex

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and why do they contain a lot of complex

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.469 
and why do they contain a lot of complex
carbohydrates<00:01:56.070> we'll<00:01:56.670> simply<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> make<00:01:57.299> sure

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
carbohydrates we'll simply to make sure

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.630 
carbohydrates we'll simply to make sure
that<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.770> body<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.100> enough

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that you that your body has enough

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.260 
that you that your body has enough
enough<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.869> sources<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.950> immediate<00:02:02.460> energy<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
enough a sources of immediate energy so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
enough a sources of immediate energy so
basically<00:02:03.600> they're<00:02:03.960> probably<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
basically they're probably one of the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
basically they're probably one of the
main<00:02:05.159> reasons<00:02:05.549> why<00:02:05.820> skinny<00:02:06.180> guys<00:02:06.390> skinny<00:02:07.049> guys

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
main reasons why skinny guys skinny guys

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160 
main reasons why skinny guys skinny guys
face<00:02:07.649> failed<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> gain<00:02:08.369> muscle<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:09.170> because

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
face failed to gain muscle is because

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
face failed to gain muscle is because
they<00:02:10.379> don't<00:02:10.619> dig<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.129> data<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.790> eat<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> lot<00:02:12.239> of

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
they don't dig up data they eat a lot of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
they don't dig up data they eat a lot of
proteins<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> lot<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.349> tasks<00:02:13.650> but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
proteins they do a lot of tasks but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.020 
proteins they do a lot of tasks but
don't<00:02:14.129> consume<00:02:14.400> enough<00:02:14.520> complex

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
don't consume enough complex

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.420 
don't consume enough complex
carbohydrates<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.780> basically<00:02:16.530> comes<00:02:17.280> to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
carbohydrates and basically comes to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670 
carbohydrates and basically comes to
complex<00:02:17.940> carbohydrates<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.379> when

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
complex carbohydrates when when we when

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.220 
complex carbohydrates when when we when
you<00:02:19.800> beat<00:02:19.950> complex<00:02:20.370> carbohydrates<00:02:21.230> they

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you beat complex carbohydrates they

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.619 
you beat complex carbohydrates they
contain<00:02:22.650> glucose<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:23.970> inside

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
contain glucose which is then inside

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.509 
contain glucose which is then inside
your<00:02:24.810> body<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.200> turned<00:02:25.530> into<00:02:25.739> glycogen<00:02:26.099> and

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
your body is turned into glycogen and

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.030 
your body is turned into glycogen and
glycogen<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.720> stored<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.230> muscles<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:28.860> an

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
glycogen is stored in your muscles as an

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
glycogen is stored in your muscles as an
immediate<00:02:29.370> source<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.760> energy<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.150> basically

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
immediate source of energy and basically

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.570 
immediate source of energy and basically
if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.230> don't<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.680> enough<00:02:31.980> glycogen<00:02:32.400> in

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
if you don't have enough glycogen in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.979 
if you don't have enough glycogen in
your<00:02:32.610> muscles<00:02:32.730> during<00:02:33.239> your<00:02:33.360> workouts<00:02:33.750> your

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
your muscles during your workouts your

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.870 
your muscles during your workouts your
body<00:02:34.230> automatically<00:02:34.920> starts<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.550> look<00:02:35.670> for

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
body automatically starts to look for

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820 
body automatically starts to look for
other<00:02:36.060> sources<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.959> energy<00:02:37.050> which<00:02:37.709> are

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
other sources of energy which are

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.309 
other sources of energy which are
proteins<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.489> proteins<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.450> your<00:02:39.900> muscles

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
proteins and proteins with your muscles

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.839 
proteins and proteins with your muscles
and<00:02:40.440> by<00:02:40.650> doing<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:40.950> instead<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.459> gaining<00:02:41.760> your

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
and by doing so instead of gaining your

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.940 
and by doing so instead of gaining your
lean<00:02:42.269> muscle<00:02:42.630> mass<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:43.200> start<00:02:43.440> losing<00:02:43.620> lean

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
lean muscle mass you start losing lean

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.619 
lean muscle mass you start losing lean
muscle<00:02:44.280> mass<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.150> probably<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
muscle mass and this is probably the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.970 
muscle mass and this is probably the
worst<00:02:45.810> thing<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.140> could<00:02:46.410> happen<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
worst thing that could happen for a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.350 
worst thing that could happen for a
skinny<00:02:47.250> guy<00:02:47.400> who's<00:02:47.640> trying<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.970> gain<00:02:48.180> muscle

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
skinny guy who's trying to gain muscle

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.979 
skinny guy who's trying to gain muscle
and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.410> finally<00:02:50.299> gainers<00:02:51.299> contain<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> lot

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
and then finally gainers contain a lot

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
and then finally gainers contain a lot
of<00:02:52.019> proteins<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.799> earlier<00:02:53.310> proteins<00:02:53.790> our

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
of proteins like earlier proteins our

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.430 
of proteins like earlier proteins our
building<00:02:54.209> blocks<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.750> everything<00:02:55.200> when

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
building blocks of everything when

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
building blocks of everything when
you're<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:55.890> body<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
you're with your body so this is a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.270 
you're with your body so this is a
simple<00:02:57.720> overview<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.349> weight<00:02:58.560> gainers<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.099> in

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
simple overview of weight gainers and in

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
simple overview of weight gainers and in
my<00:02:59.430> opinion<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.880> is<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> best<00:03:00.150> supplement

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
my opinion this is the best supplement

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.449 
my opinion this is the best supplement
any<00:03:01.019> newbie<00:03:01.319> can<00:03:01.470> pick<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> store<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
any newbie can pick up in the store and

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.460 
any newbie can pick up in the store and
they<00:03:02.640> don't<00:03:02.849> cost<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.180> lot<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.329> money<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.260> now

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
they don't cost a lot of money so now

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.199 
they don't cost a lot of money so now
let's<00:03:04.769> talk<00:03:04.920> about<00:03:04.980> whey<00:03:05.340> proteins<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.030> whey

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
let's talk about whey proteins and whey

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.870 
let's talk about whey proteins and whey
proteins<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:07.310> another<00:03:08.310> type<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.579> supplement

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
proteins are another type of supplement

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.520 
proteins are another type of supplement
but<00:03:09.269> in<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.510> case<00:03:09.720> they<00:03:10.019> don't<00:03:10.170> contain<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
but in this case they don't contain a

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.580 
but in this case they don't contain a
lot<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:11.599> complex<00:03:12.599> carbohydrates<00:03:13.290> some<00:03:13.440> of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
lot of complex carbohydrates some of

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.740 
lot of complex carbohydrates some of
them<00:03:13.709> don't<00:03:14.280> don't<00:03:14.670> contain<00:03:14.940> carbohydrates

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
them don't don't contain carbohydrates

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.530 
them don't don't contain carbohydrates
carbohydrates<00:03:16.440> at<00:03:17.340> all<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.420> basically

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
carbohydrates at all and but basically

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.470 
carbohydrates at all and but basically
they<00:03:18.959> contain<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.470> lot<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.650> proteins<00:03:20.100> around<00:03:20.480> 24

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
they contain a lot of proteins around 24

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.259 
they contain a lot of proteins around 24
grams<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.560> 30<00:03:22.799> grams<00:03:23.069> per<00:03:23.340> there's<00:03:23.549> for<00:03:24.120> those

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
grams to 30 grams per there's for those

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.090 
grams to 30 grams per there's for those
and<00:03:24.540> basically<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.530> said<00:03:25.650> earlier

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and basically like I said earlier

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.949 
and basically like I said earlier
proteins<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.940> building<00:03:27.209> blocks<00:03:27.690> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
proteins are building blocks of

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.660 
proteins are building blocks of
everything<00:03:28.380> within<00:03:28.530> your<00:03:28.709> body<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.190> they're

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
everything within your body and they're

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.309 
everything within your body and they're
needed<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.120> make<00:03:30.269> our<00:03:30.299> muscle<00:03:30.810> true<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
needed to make our muscle true and

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.870 
needed to make our muscle true and
what's<00:03:31.829> good<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.100> whey<00:03:32.400> protein

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
what's good about whey protein

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.520 
what's good about whey protein
supplements<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.780> they<00:03:34.049> are<00:03:34.260> really

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
supplements is that they are really

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
supplements is that they are really
great<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.980> use<00:03:35.160> immediately<00:03:35.519> after<00:03:36.120> your

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
great to use immediately after your

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.629 
great to use immediately after your
workouts<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.139> basically<00:03:37.560> after<00:03:37.859> each<00:03:38.190> workout

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
workouts so basically after each workout

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.840 
workouts so basically after each workout
session<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:40.230> muscle<00:03:40.650> tissue<00:03:40.799> gets<00:03:41.430> damaged

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
session your muscle tissue gets damaged

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.590 
session your muscle tissue gets damaged
and<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:44.400> speed<00:03:44.579> up<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.850> recovery<00:03:45.000> to

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and you just speed up the recovery to

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720 
and you just speed up the recovery to
make<00:03:46.170> sure<00:03:46.350> your<00:03:46.470> muscles<00:03:46.620> grow<00:03:46.859> quicker<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
make sure your muscles grow quicker you

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.789 
make sure your muscles grow quicker you
can<00:03:47.760> amelie<00:03:48.420> after<00:03:48.780> each<00:03:48.989> workout<00:03:49.380> session

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
can amelie after each workout session

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.280 
can amelie after each workout session
have<00:03:50.100> a<00:03:50.519> protein<00:03:50.970> shake<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.269> by<00:03:51.780> doing<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.079> you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
have a protein shake and by doing so you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.319 
have a protein shake and by doing so you
will<00:03:52.440> give<00:03:52.769> your<00:03:52.859> body<00:03:53.069> building<00:03:53.910> materials

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
will give your body building materials

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.360 
will give your body building materials
when<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> when<00:03:55.139> they're<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.470> most<00:03:55.500> needed<00:03:55.950> and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
when it when they're the most needed and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.190 
when it when they're the most needed and
like<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.819> said<00:03:57.000> earlier<00:03:57.180> by<00:03:57.569> doing<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.170> will

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
like I said earlier by doing so you will

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.080 
like I said earlier by doing so you will
speed<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.769> recovery<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.489> growth<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.970> your

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
speed up the recovery and growth of your

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.780 
speed up the recovery and growth of your
muscle<00:04:00.420> tissue<00:04:00.650> so<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:02.190> let's<00:04:02.579> talk<00:04:02.730> about

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
muscle tissue so now let's talk about

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.000 
muscle tissue so now let's talk about
creatine<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.349> an<00:04:04.470> interesting<00:04:04.859> one

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
creatine and this is an interesting one

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
creatine and this is an interesting one
because<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.730> lot<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:05.970> guys<00:04:06.150> from<00:04:06.359> new<00:04:06.540> to

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
because a lot of guys from new to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.129 
because a lot of guys from new to
fitness

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
fitness

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.589 
fitness
think<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.769> creatine<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.489> some<00:04:09.329> sort<00:04:09.540> of

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
think that creatine is some sort of

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.599 
think that creatine is some sort of
magical<00:04:10.260> supplement<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.889> will<00:04:11.069> make<00:04:11.220> big

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
magical supplement that will make big

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.479 
magical supplement that will make big
and<00:04:11.790> strong<00:04:11.880> almost<00:04:12.810> immediately<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.829> they

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
and strong almost immediately and they

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.190 
and strong almost immediately and they
think<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.910> some<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.359> some<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.079> guys

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
think that some of some of the guys

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.930 
think that some of some of the guys
think<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.769> great<00:04:17.070> scene<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.370> kind<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.700> linked

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
think that great scene is kind of linked

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.089 
think that great scene is kind of linked
to<00:04:18.090> anabolic<00:04:18.599> steroids<00:04:19.019> but<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:19.709> complete

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
to anabolic steroids but that's complete

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.290 
to anabolic steroids but that's complete
 so<00:04:21.150> basically<00:04:22.490> Korea<00:04:23.490> seems<00:04:23.760> what

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
 so basically Korea seems what

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.850 
 so basically Korea seems what
Christian<00:04:24.690> supplements<00:04:25.110> do<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.680> said

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
Christian supplements do is like I said

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.560 
Christian supplements do is like I said
earlier<00:04:26.159> they<00:04:26.310> improve<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.820> efficiency<00:04:27.300> or

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
earlier they improve the efficiency or

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.170 
earlier they improve the efficiency or
you're<00:04:27.780> easy<00:04:28.080> PPC<00:04:28.770> energy<00:04:29.160> system<00:04:29.520> which<00:04:29.670> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
you're easy PPC energy system which is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.850 
you're easy PPC energy system which is
the<00:04:30.300> main<00:04:30.510> energy<00:04:31.020> system<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.650> used

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
the main energy system that is used

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.530 
the main energy system that is used
during<00:04:32.040> your<00:04:32.130> workouts<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:32.820> your<00:04:33.240> body<00:04:33.420> has

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
during your workouts so your body has

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.830 
during your workouts so your body has
free<00:04:34.080> energy<00:04:34.800> systems<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.970> ATP<00:04:36.390> PC

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
free energy systems and the ATP PC

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.720 
free energy systems and the ATP PC
energy<00:04:37.170> system<00:04:37.530> their<00:04:37.680> lactic<00:04:38.070> acid<00:04:38.400> energy

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
energy system their lactic acid energy

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.240 
energy system their lactic acid energy
system<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.210> aerobic<00:04:39.900> energy<00:04:39.990> system<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.620> a

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
system and aerobic energy system and a

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.000 
system and aerobic energy system and a
CPP<00:04:41.790> C<00:04:42.000> energy<00:04:42.810> system<00:04:43.170> doesn't<00:04:43.530> use<00:04:43.800> any

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
CPP C energy system doesn't use any

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.490 
CPP C energy system doesn't use any
oxygen<00:04:44.370> to<00:04:45.180> produce<00:04:45.360> energy<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.080> instead

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
oxygen to produce energy and instead

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.900 
oxygen to produce energy and instead
like<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> said<00:04:47.070> earlier<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> main<00:04:47.670> energy

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
like I said earlier is the main energy

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.910 
like I said earlier is the main energy
system<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:48.480> is<00:04:48.690> used<00:04:48.720> during<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.530> workouts

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
system that is used during the workouts

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.850 
system that is used during the workouts
so<00:04:50.300> what<00:04:51.300> creatine<00:04:51.660> supplements<00:04:52.170> do<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.590> they

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
so what creatine supplements do is they

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.880 
so what creatine supplements do is they
sped<00:04:53.310> up<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:54.260> replenishment<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.710> the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
sped up the replenishment and the

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.460 
sped up the replenishment and the
recovery<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.520> fossil<00:04:57.270> creatine<00:04:57.780> which<00:04:58.230> is<00:04:58.440> a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
recovery of fossil creatine which is a

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.140 
recovery of fossil creatine which is a
molecule<00:04:58.890> which<00:04:59.310> is<00:04:59.400> broken<00:04:59.760> down<00:05:00.090> by

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
molecule which is broken down by

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.720 
molecule which is broken down by
creatine<00:05:00.960> kinase<00:05:01.170> so<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.310> little<00:05:02.490> bit<00:05:02.670> of

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
creatine kinase so a little bit of

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.180 
creatine kinase so a little bit of
science<00:05:03.030> here<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:03.360> basically<00:05:04.130> there's<00:05:05.130> this

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
science here but basically there's this

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
science here but basically there's this
molecule<00:05:05.700> called<00:05:06.210> phosphocreatine

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
molecule called phosphocreatine

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.130 
molecule called phosphocreatine
and<00:05:07.740> once<00:05:08.670> it's<00:05:08.820> broken<00:05:09.030> down<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.630> creates<00:05:09.840> one

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
and once it's broken down it creates one

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.440 
and once it's broken down it creates one
molecule<00:05:10.380> of<00:05:10.760> phosphate<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.970> one<00:05:12.180> molecule

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
molecule of phosphate and one molecule

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.540 
molecule of phosphate and one molecule
of<00:05:12.660> creatine<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.260> basically<00:05:13.980> phosphate

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
of creatine and basically phosphate

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.940 
of creatine and basically phosphate
joins<00:05:15.000> another<00:05:15.180> molecule<00:05:15.690> called<00:05:16.140> added<00:05:16.650> Zeno

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
joins another molecule called added Zeno

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.260 
joins another molecule called added Zeno
diphosphate<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.120> once<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.110> joins<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:20.060> ADP<00:05:21.060> it

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
diphosphate and once it joins a ADP it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.690 
diphosphate and once it joins a ADP it
creates<00:05:21.720> ATP<00:05:22.350> which<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.680> can<00:05:22.890> which<00:05:23.340> can<00:05:23.550> then

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
creates ATP which you can which can then

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.370 
creates ATP which you can which can then
be<00:05:23.760> broken<00:05:24.060> down<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.690> create<00:05:24.930> instant

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
be broken down to create instant

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.950 
be broken down to create instant
resource<00:05:25.830> of<00:05:26.010> energy<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:26.970> by<00:05:27.210> doing<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:27.720> I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
resource of energy so by doing so I

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.750

after workouts and by doing so will you

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.440 
after workouts and by doing so will you
will<00:05:42.660> still<00:05:42.870> stimulate<00:05:43.500> more<00:05:43.740> muscle<00:05:44.270> so<00:05:45.270> this

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
will still stimulate more muscle so this

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.910 
will still stimulate more muscle so this
