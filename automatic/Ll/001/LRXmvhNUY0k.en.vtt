00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
want the game to survive long enough

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.920

like<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.819> know<00:03:08.910> some<00:03:09.180> games<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.540> dragon

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like it you know some games like dragon

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.920 
like it you know some games like dragon
city<00:03:10.190> dragonvale<00:03:11.190> days<00:03:11.580> they've<00:03:12.510> been<00:03:12.720> there

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
city dragonvale days they've been there

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.890 
city dragonvale days they've been there
for<00:03:13.319> years<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.670> people<00:03:14.880> still<00:03:15.330> remember<00:03:15.569> it

and I think age of extinction is just

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.729 
and I think age of extinction is just
kind<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.620> downhill<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:22.560> what

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
kind of going downhill and that's what

kind of going downhill and that's what
