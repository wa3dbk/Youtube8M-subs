00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
today we'll see how to draw white lace

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.180 
today we'll see how to draw white lace
using<00:00:07.890> Photoshop<00:00:09.170> as<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> first<00:00:10.650> thing<00:00:10.920> we

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
using Photoshop as the first thing we

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.450 
using Photoshop as the first thing we
scan<00:00:11.519> our<00:00:11.730> croaky<00:00:12.360> or<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.750> photograph<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.469> then

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
scan our croaky or we photograph it then

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.180 
scan our croaky or we photograph it then
we<00:00:14.700> put<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.089> into<00:00:15.240> Photoshop<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.190> image

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
we put it into Photoshop and image

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.750 
we put it into Photoshop and image
adjustment<00:00:17.940> levels<00:00:18.890> now<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.949> need<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.520> select

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
adjustment levels now we need to select

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.240 
adjustment levels now we need to select
the<00:00:21.300> world<00:00:21.539> crocus<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.230> drag<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> drop<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the world crocus and drag and drop on a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.609 
the world crocus and drag and drop on a
new<00:00:23.550> layer

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
new layer

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
new layer
remember<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> color<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> new<00:00:26.340> layer<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.150> gray

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
remember to color the new layer and gray

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.240 
remember to color the new layer and gray
so<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.920> white<00:00:29.220> lace<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:29.910> stand<00:00:30.240> out

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
so that the white lace will stand out

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
so that the white lace will stand out
when<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.460> done<00:00:32.640> adjusting<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.630> procas

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
when we are done adjusting the procas

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.490 
when we are done adjusting the procas
dimension<00:00:34.860> we'll<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> magic<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.809> select

select save selection propane now we

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.819 
select save selection propane now we
need<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> show<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> gray<00:00:48.719> background<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.710> the

need to show the gray background to the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.340 
need to show the gray background to the
transparent<00:00:50.430> fabric<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.840> create<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> new

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
transparent fabric so we create a new

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.529 
transparent fabric so we create a new
layer<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:53.129> call<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> over<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> transparent

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
layer we call it over the transparent

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
layer we call it over the transparent
areas<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> background<00:00:55.770> color<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
areas with the background color and to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
areas with the background color and to
recover<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.570> lines<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:58.410> duplicate<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
recover the lines we duplicate the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
recover the lines we duplicate the
croakies<00:00:59.670> layer<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.629> drag<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> over<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> shop

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
croakies layer we drag it over the shop

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.480 
croakies layer we drag it over the shop
and<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.190> set<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> multiply<00:01:03.270> done<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and we set it as a multiply done then we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
and we set it as a multiply done then we
pick<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> nice<00:01:08.970> skin<00:01:09.360> color<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.080> create<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> new

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
layer we set it as and multiply and we

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
layer we set it as and multiply and we
call<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.250> wolf<00:01:14.460> skin<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:15.390> forget
