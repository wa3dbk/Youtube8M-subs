00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.960 
the files I'm guessing but with PSP 3000
are<00:02:58.770> some<00:02:58.980> security<00:02:59.340> things<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.850> don't

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
are some security things that don't

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.060 
allow you do that so you have to press a
launcher<00:03:02.580> every<00:03:02.850> time<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> reboot<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.709> now

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
launcher every time you reboot so now

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
n64 one because it's kind of the frames

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.300 
n64 one because it's kind of the frames
dip<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:41.040> lot<00:03:41.420> especially<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:43.190> Super<00:03:44.190> Smash

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
dip a lot especially for Super Smash

00:03:44.310 --> 00:04:00.160 
dip a lot especially for Super Smash
Bros<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:49.650> look<00:03:49.950> at<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:53.970> hard

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.200 

see<00:04:01.170> it's<00:04:01.410> kind<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.740> just<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.940> choppy

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
see it's kind of like just really choppy

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.620 
see it's kind of like just really choppy
and<00:04:03.600> if<00:04:03.960> you<00:04:04.920> try<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.190> put<00:04:05.460> on<00:04:05.550> sound<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.300> could

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
and if you try to put on sound you could

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.100 
and if you try to put on sound you could
but<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.650> gets<00:04:07.770> very<00:04:07.860> choppy<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.730> do<00:04:08.850> that

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
but it gets very choppy if you do that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.100 
but it gets very choppy if you do that
extremely<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:11.100> you're<00:04:11.850> most<00:04:12.180> likely<00:04:12.420> not

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
extremely so you're most likely not

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.720 
extremely so you're most likely not
gonna<00:04:13.290> play<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.740> game<00:04:13.800> on<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.220> because<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:14.580> it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
gonna play this game on it because if it

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.600 
gonna play this game on it because if it
runs<00:04:15.060> very<00:04:15.180> copy<00:04:15.660> but<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.320> could<00:04:16.680> try<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
runs very copy but you could try to the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.330 
runs very copy but you could try to the
games<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.270> one<00:04:18.620> it's<00:04:19.620> kind<00:04:19.830> of<00:04:19.890> welds

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
games this one it's kind of welds

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.530 
games this one it's kind of welds
basically<00:04:20.670> on<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.850> second<00:04:21.090> level<00:04:21.209> there's<00:04:21.450> a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
basically on the second level there's a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.980 
basically on the second level there's a
lot<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.870> them<00:04:22.020> but<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:23.130> very<00:04:24.060> choppy<00:04:24.390> okay<00:04:24.930> so

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
lot of them but it's very choppy okay so

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.810 
lot of them but it's very choppy okay so
on<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.500> next<00:04:25.590> one<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.790> Genesis
