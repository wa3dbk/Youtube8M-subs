00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
joist is taped to the OSB she's still

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.710 
joist is taped to the OSB she's still
fairly<00:04:43.290> labor-intensive<00:04:44.160> but<00:04:44.450> we<00:04:45.450> believe

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
fairly labor-intensive but we believe

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.070 
fairly labor-intensive but we believe
will<00:04:46.100> give<00:04:47.100> us<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.340> results<00:04:47.730> we<00:04:47.760> require<00:04:48.180> yeah

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
will give us the results we require yeah

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.310 
will give us the results we require yeah
in<00:04:49.170> this<00:04:49.290> location<00:04:50.510> life's<00:04:51.510> made<00:04:51.780> easier<00:04:52.260> in

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
in this location life's made easier in

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.500 
in this location life's made easier in
one<00:04:52.440> respect<00:04:52.710> because<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.970> outside<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.450> the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
one respect because the outside of the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.930 
one respect because the outside of the
wall<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.690> insulated<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.580> we've<00:04:56.580> not<00:04:56.730> got<00:04:56.910> a

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
wall is insulated so we've not got a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.450 
wall is insulated so we've not got a
rock<00:04:57.540> problem<00:04:57.990> whether<00:04:58.320> these<00:04:58.890> joists<00:04:59.160> now

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
rock problem whether these joists now

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340 
rock problem whether these joists now
sitting<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.000> lot<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.390> moisture<00:05:00.480> yeah<00:05:00.990> but<00:05:01.230> we

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
sitting a lot of moisture yeah but we

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.450 
sitting a lot of moisture yeah but we
still<00:05:01.380> have<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.760> air<00:05:02.880> tightness<00:05:03.150> issue<00:05:03.450> so<00:05:04.460> in

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
still have the air tightness issue so in

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.580 
still have the air tightness issue so in
order<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.790> achieve<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.690> good<00:05:07.200> air<00:05:07.380> tightness

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
order to achieve a a good air tightness

the plastered wall you can see first
first<00:05:14.970> job<00:05:15.510> was<00:05:15.660> to<00:05:15.720> power<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.890> exposed

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
first job was to power to the exposed

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.890 
first job was to power to the exposed
brickwork<00:05:17.520> which<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.150> brown<00:05:18.360> sand<00:05:18.780> and

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
brickwork which is the brown sand and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.370 
brickwork which is the brown sand and
cement<00:05:19.370> there<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.760> then<00:05:21.600> take<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.110> joist

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
cement there and then take the joist

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.500 
cement there and then take the joist
with<00:05:22.620> this<00:05:22.740> blue<00:05:22.950> tape<00:05:23.220> so<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.030> we<00:05:24.270> could

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
with this blue tape so that we could

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.700 
with this blue tape so that we could
make<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.500> an<00:05:26.280> edge<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.760> joists<00:05:27.390> gonna<00:05:27.810> be<00:05:27.960> stuck

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
make a an edge the joists gonna be stuck

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.240 
make a an edge the joists gonna be stuck
to<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:30.170> contiguous<00:05:31.170> been<00:05:31.410> stuck<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.130> the

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.660 
blue and then stuck to the sand and
cement<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.360> then<00:05:36.810> this<00:05:37.230> pink<00:05:37.590> plaster<00:05:38.190> is

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
cement and then this pink plaster is

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.200 
cement and then this pink plaster is
applied<00:05:39.030> over<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.360> top<00:05:39.630> so<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.530> should<00:05:41.210> give

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
applied over the top so that should give

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.800 
applied over the top so that should give
us<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:43.160> completely<00:05:44.160> sanitized<00:05:45.150> Junction<00:05:45.690> that

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
us a completely sanitized Junction that

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.980 
us a completely sanitized Junction that
point<00:05:46.080> it's<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.010> other<00:05:47.130> classic<00:05:47.910> problem<00:05:48.330> if

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
point it's the other classic problem if

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.280 
point it's the other classic problem if
you<00:05:49.140> go<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:49.860> an<00:05:50.130> external<00:05:50.660> insulation<00:05:51.660> system

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
you go to an external insulation system

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.180 
you go to an external insulation system
is<00:05:52.380> render<00:05:54.050> gets<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.140> add<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.290> lot<00:05:55.470> of<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.620> sort

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
is render gets you add a lot of the sort

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.700 
is render gets you add a lot of the sort
of<00:05:56.250> joist<00:05:56.520> issues<00:05:57.140> but<00:05:58.140> then<00:05:58.260> when<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.440> bring
