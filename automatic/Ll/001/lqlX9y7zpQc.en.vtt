00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
saw with this Guardian in particular is

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.110 
saw with this Guardian in particular is
that<00:05:44.100> he<00:05:44.190> could<00:05:44.310> create<00:05:44.490> duplicates<00:05:44.970> of

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
that he could create duplicates of

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000 
that he could create duplicates of
himself<00:05:45.480> so<00:05:46.110> random<00:05:46.560> there's<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:46.890> couple

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
himself so random there's a couple

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.260 
himself so random there's a couple
different<00:05:47.250> ways<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.700> approach<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.090> but

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
different ways to approach this but

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.480 
different ways to approach this but
Randall<00:05:48.570> sorta<00:05:48.810> took<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.170> route<00:05:49.410> one<00:05:49.650> method

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
Randall sorta took the route one method

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.370 
Randall sorta took the route one method
which<00:05:50.640> is<00:05:50.820> just<00:05:50.940> hack<00:05:51.540> away<00:05:51.720> at<00:05:51.870> as<00:05:52.080> many<00:05:52.260> of

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
which is just hack away at as many of

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.870 
which is just hack away at as many of
these<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.710> try<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.920> suss<00:05:53.190> out<00:05:53.370> which<00:05:53.610> one<00:05:53.790> is

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
these to try to suss out which one is

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.250 
these to try to suss out which one is
the<00:05:53.970> real<00:05:54.120> creature<00:05:54.420> and<00:05:54.660> then<00:05:54.720> take<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.020> on

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
the real creature and then take that on

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.830 
the real creature and then take that on
now<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.340> he's<00:05:56.430> defeated<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.940> Guardian<00:05:57.330> he

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
now that he's defeated the Guardian he

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.660 
now that he's defeated the Guardian he
actually<00:05:57.990> can<00:05:58.350> break<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.770> seal<00:05:58.980> by<00:05:59.190> using<00:05:59.460> the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
actually can break the seal by using the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.790 
actually can break the seal by using the
weapon<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.120> key<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.570> using<00:06:01.500> one<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:01.680> these

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
weapon the key and using one of these

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.560 
weapon the key and using one of these
pillars<00:06:02.100> you'll<00:06:02.700> note<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:02.940> each<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
pillars you'll note that each of the

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.300 
pillars you'll note that each of the
pillars<00:06:03.870> actually<00:06:04.290> has<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.470> different<00:06:04.950> bonus

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
that can be applied to the weapon and

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.650 
that can be applied to the weapon and
every<00:06:07.650> seal<00:06:07.950> has<00:06:08.520> different<00:06:09.030> bonuses<00:06:09.210> as<00:06:09.630> well

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
every seal has different bonuses as well

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.930 
every seal has different bonuses as well
so<00:06:10.050> what<00:06:10.200> this<00:06:10.320> means<00:06:10.620> is<00:06:10.800> as<00:06:11.010> a<00:06:11.040> player<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.700> can
