than<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.430> wife<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.210> husbands<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
than one wife there to be husbands of

than one wife there to be husbands of
one<00:02:03.990> wife<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.700> idea<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.829> look

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
