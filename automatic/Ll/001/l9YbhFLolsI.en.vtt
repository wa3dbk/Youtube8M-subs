00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 very good to all welcome a new 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.910
 video and this time I bring you another episode 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 more is this and another more to go up 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.019
 are the last two already new 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 players since there are not that many 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 so much attention to players like that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 Well they have done good seasons 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 with your equipment or players that I 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 You also ask quite a lot because now 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 they are a bit fashionable or they are starting to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 be known if they were not in fifa 15 and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 nothing you already know that you can leave your 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.890
 suggestions you can also leave 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 suggestions on what players 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640
 prove that you want me to try or that you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 say stockings and others and players 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.730
 should be in this series or in the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.469
 series that starts after this one 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 players that is two best players 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 you already know all suggestions in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.899
 comments if you like and value this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 I work behind all these letters 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 these players for you so that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.219
 you know the statistics and all this more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 then leave your like and we start already 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 kids the first player is a player 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.520
 whoever he was or was a little indignant 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.739
 with the average and the statistics that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.829
 they have put in beta this is Carlos 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.330
 castro player of the sporting only 60 of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.180
 66 average of 69 rhythm shot 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.460
 these statistics do not go at all 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 for nothing with the players hooks in 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.060
 second the truth is that I have been like a 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.760
 joke see this letter in the truth 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.520
 I hope that in the end in the in the version 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.910
 end of 1016 finish pretty much improved 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.470
 because if you do not notice once again that the 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.270
 people from those who do not take the ones from 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.770
 the medias and so on do not notice 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.140
 true in the seasons that the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.610
 players only notice the players 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.500
 important and these players because they 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.630
 they leave a little aside because the truth to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.400
 Carlos Castro and Jonny are two players 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.930
 I've seen that the truth that they put 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.090
 quite bad enough for what 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.470
 they usually have in real life I do not know if 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.450
 I am a follower of esport ime entenderéis 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.210
 If you have never seen a game of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.100
 sporting it is normal that you do not understand 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.990
 but I'm telling you 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.880
 impressive the low average that you have 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 put but nothing happened already the next 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 a player that you also asked me 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.600
 enough and it is danilo 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 barbosa del valencià a player from 72 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.410
 average that does not look bad at all 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 just a little bit is a bit short of 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.660
 rhythm 66 but good good defense 72 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.300
 good physical good dribling a player who 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 well that also promises 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.690
 I do not think it's one of the most used or 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.300
 not because you already know that the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.700
 rhythm is also something that we look at 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.530
 many to buy any player and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 to 66 it may be a bit backwards but 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.950
 He is a player that I thought was good 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.110
 pretty decent 72 of average this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.450
 Brazilian see valencia that is nothing 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.130
 bad this danky barbosa and tell me 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.570
 you too me this player 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.180
 the truth that I've never seen play 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.680
 tell me if it deserves that average not the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.890
 comments and others to see what you think 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.600
 and we already passed with the last player to the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.020
 third another player that you had me 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.440
 asked very much very much and very much 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.080
 it is about asensio frame 71 of half ms 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.000
 or of real madrid yes they are in the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.680
 beta but some statistics too 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.260
 quite poor in terms of pace 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.060
 Asensio rhythm, what I 've seen and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.740
 with the mallorca because they go in madrid not 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.090
 I have seen nothing the truth that you have not seen 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.830
 the preseason of more but with the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 mallorca has also come out with the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.250
 selection only 65 of pace the truth a 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.230
 little justitos 74 of dribbling that yes that 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.850
 is good pass 71 the rest yes that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.860
 is fine and which would also raise a 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.480
 Tiny shot but good 10 the rhythm 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.050
 it seems a bit short but good 71 of 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.490
 socks 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.220
 because you already know a promise 3 of 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.040
 watermarks and good is not not bad is 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.970
 a pretty decent player inside 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.580
 of what is a silver that good as 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.050
 you know the rhythm we always look 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.020
 much in the rhythm as I said with 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.790
 the bearded danilo in the players if not 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.890
 I know if it will be the most bought yet 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.570
 so acens and a player marked me 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.910
 I'll try it because it's a game I like 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.440
 quite real life and nothing to tell me 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.940
 What do you think about that? 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.430
 media and others demarcated asensio those who 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.140
 you have seen also play some match 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.730
 that you have planned a bar you have not 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.320
 seen more games marked promotions and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.880
 that I can not talk much but 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.620
 good if there is any of you I have 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.420
 seen more parties tell me what do you think 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.650
 those stats that have put you in the beta 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.930
 that you already know are not for nothing 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.310
 Officials can change perfectly 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.230
 the final but in the beta they have those 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.010
 statistics so I do not expect anything 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.450
 you think you like him for this 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.590
 work that entails you already know how to enter 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.800
 all these letters all the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.900
 statistics and all this and nothing else 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.220
 guys subscribe for more see you in 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.220
