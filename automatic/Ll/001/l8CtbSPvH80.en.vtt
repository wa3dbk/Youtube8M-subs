00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
ridiculous um that's just the start of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
ridiculous um that's just the start of
it<00:01:10.469> honestly<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.429> all<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.450> going

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

it honestly like all right so I'm going
to<00:01:12.659> go<00:01:12.780> over<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.259> patch<00:01:13.439> notes<00:01:13.469> now

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to go over some of the patch notes now

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679 
to go over some of the patch notes now
and<00:01:14.130> explain<00:01:14.429> like<00:01:14.819> what<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.240> stated

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and explain like what they stated

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.830 
and explain like what they stated
happened<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.069> happened<00:01:17.609> so<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
happened and what really happened so the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
happened and what really happened so the
first<00:01:19.109> thing<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.710> mk14<00:01:20.310> reduced<00:01:20.969> r<00:01:21.149> equal

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
first thing is the mk14 reduced r equal

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
first thing is the mk14 reduced r equal
so<00:01:22.469> they<00:01:22.619> reduce<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.249> recoil<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:24.200> mk14<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so they reduce the recoil on mk14 that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.169 
so they reduce the recoil on mk14 that
didn't<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.340> too<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.639> recoil<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
didn't really have too much recoil to

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.809 
didn't really have too much recoil to
begin<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.649> weapon<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.609> not

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
begin with and the weapon is really not

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.149 
begin with and the weapon is really not
any<00:01:30.149> better<00:01:30.479> than<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.929> ok<00:01:31.679> has<00:01:31.859> slightly

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
any better than it was ok has slightly

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.849 
any better than it was ok has slightly
less<00:01:32.460> recoil<00:01:32.700> big<00:01:33.329> freakin<00:01:33.929> deal<00:01:33.959> give<00:01:34.649> the

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
less recoil big freakin deal give the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.230 
less recoil big freakin deal give the
weapon<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.249> little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.609> more<00:01:35.759> damage<00:01:36.119> it

that's the whole point of having a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.649 
that's the whole point of having a
single<00:01:44.670> shot<00:01:44.789> weapon<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.179> that<00:01:45.299> game<00:01:45.509> where

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
single shot weapon in that game where

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.239 
single shot weapon in that game where
you<00:01:45.749> move<00:01:45.899> around<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.319> fast<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.889> you<00:01:47.039> got<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
you move around so fast like you got to

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.709 
you move around so fast like you got to
be<00:01:47.399> able<00:01:47.459> to<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> shot<00:01:47.880> somebody<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.389> across

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
be able to to shot somebody not across

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.359 
be able to to shot somebody not across
the<00:01:48.779> map<00:01:49.109> not<00:01:49.319> an<00:01:49.439> infinite<00:01:49.829> two<00:01:49.979> shot<00:01:50.159> kill

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the map not an infinite two shot kill

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
the map not an infinite two shot kill
range<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.179> should<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
range but it should be like a two to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
range but it should be like a two to
three<00:01:52.200> shot<00:01:52.409> kill<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:53.219> next<00:01:53.459> thing<00:01:53.609> is<00:01:53.639> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
three shot kill the next thing is the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.590 
three shot kill the next thing is the
ARX<00:01:54.439> they<00:01:55.439> increase<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.039> magazine<00:01:56.459> size<00:01:56.700> why

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ARX they increase the magazine size why

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.529 
ARX they increase the magazine size why
I<00:01:57.959> just<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:58.979> who<00:01:59.639> decided<00:02:00.240> oh

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
I just don't get it like who decided oh

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.029 
I just don't get it like who decided oh
the<00:02:00.749> arocs<00:02:01.109> that<00:02:01.319> didn't<00:02:01.529> have<00:02:01.649> enough<00:02:01.829> ammo

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
the arocs that didn't have enough ammo

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.519 
the arocs that didn't have enough ammo
whatever<00:02:02.789> I<00:02:02.849> like<00:02:02.969> Derek<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.139> you<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.499> I

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
whatever I like Derek so it's you know I

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:05.870 
whatever I like Derek so it's you know I
don't<00:02:04.709> really<00:02:04.889> complain<00:02:05.429> about<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.759> too<00:02:05.849> much

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
don't really complain about it too much

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210 
don't really complain about it too much
but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.389> just<00:02:06.569> think<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.899> weird<00:02:07.139> like<00:02:07.560> why

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
but I just think it's weird like why

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.420 
but I just think it's weird like why
would<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.759> um<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:10.110> AMR<00:02:10.500> nine<00:02:10.679> it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
would they do that um the AMR nine it's

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.210 
would they do that um the AMR nine it's
it<00:02:11.819> says<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> increased<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> damage<00:02:13.220> barely

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it says it increased the damage barely

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.370 
it says it increased the damage barely
increase<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> damage<00:02:14.850> as

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
increase the damage as

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.440 
increase the damage as
six<00:02:15.770> reduced<00:02:16.580> recoil<00:02:16.850> ah<00:02:18.520> okay<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:20.150> weapon

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
six reduced recoil ah okay the weapon

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.210 
six reduced recoil ah okay the weapon
had<00:02:20.600> hardly<00:02:20.930> any<00:02:21.110> recoil<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.740> was<00:02:21.920> that

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
had hardly any recoil as it was that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.160 
had hardly any recoil as it was that
weapon<00:02:22.490> needs<00:02:22.640> more<00:02:22.820> power<00:02:23.060> like<00:02:23.450> don't<00:02:23.690> why

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
weapon needs more power like don't why

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.870 
weapon needs more power like don't why
are<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:24.440> taking<00:02:24.710> all<00:02:25.070> these<00:02:25.220> under<00:02:25.550> powered

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
are they taking all these under powered

are they taking all these under powered
weapons<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:26.360> just<00:02:26.510> giving<00:02:26.660> them<00:02:26.840> less<00:02:26.960> recoil

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
weapons and just giving them less recoil

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.410 
weapons and just giving them less recoil
like<00:02:27.620> what<00:02:27.800> they<00:02:27.920> need<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.970> little<00:02:29.000> bit

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
five shot killed make it more of a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.270 
five shot killed make it more of a
combination<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.320> hybrid<00:02:48.590> women<00:02:49.070> and

piece<00:03:20.210> of<00:03:20.240> garbage<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:21.100> tried<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.220> out<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.640> very

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
piece of garbage I tried it out not very

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.350 
piece of garbage I tried it out not very
good<00:03:23.650> PDW<00:03:24.650> increased<00:03:25.250> damage<00:03:25.490> all<00:03:25.970> right<00:03:26.210> I'm

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
good PDW increased damage all right I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.090 
good PDW increased damage all right I'm
cool<00:03:26.510> with<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.990> PDW<00:03:27.500> definitely<00:03:27.890> needed

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
cool with that the PDW definitely needed

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.770 
cool with that the PDW definitely needed
some<00:03:28.130> increased<00:03:28.520> damage<00:03:28.760> alright<00:03:29.450> let's<00:03:29.630> see

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
some increased damage alright let's see

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.550 
some increased damage alright let's see
here<00:03:29.990> s12<00:03:30.860> increased<00:03:31.790> fire<00:03:32.090> rate<00:03:32.560> increased

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
here s12 increased fire rate increased

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.310 
here s12 increased fire rate increased
damage<00:03:33.800> is<00:03:34.490> weapons<00:03:34.970> still<00:03:35.180> bad<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:36.140> thing

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
damage is weapons still bad the thing

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.750 
damage is weapons still bad the thing
about<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.680> though<00:03:36.710> this<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.400> how<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:37.580> know

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
about it though this is like how I know

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.250 
about it though this is like how I know
that<00:03:38.150> they<00:03:38.240> don't<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:38.480> put<00:03:38.840> any<00:03:38.960> time

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
that they don't really put any time

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.350 
that they don't really put any time
and/or<00:03:39.650> thought<00:03:39.950> into<00:03:40.220> their<00:03:40.340> patches<00:03:40.550> so

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
and/or thought into their patches so

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.090 
and/or thought into their patches so
they<00:03:41.510> increase<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.170> fire<00:03:42.410> rate<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.890> base

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
they increase the fire rate on the base

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.730 
they increase the fire rate on the base
s12<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:44.330> all<00:03:44.570> these<00:03:44.750> weapon<00:03:45.140> variants<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
s12 so all these weapon variants of the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.560 
s12 so all these weapon variants of the
s12<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.490> whirlwind<00:03:46.880> which<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.300> have

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
s12 like the whirlwind which I have

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.110 
s12 like the whirlwind which I have
which<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.020> an<00:03:48.110> elite<00:03:48.380> very<00:03:48.620> actually<00:03:49.120> fire

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
which is an elite very actually fire

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.110 
which is an elite very actually fire
slower<00:03:50.780> than<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.590> regular<00:03:52.010> s12<00:03:52.730> now<00:03:52.910> how

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
slower than the regular s12 now how

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.230 
slower than the regular s12 now how
broken<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.110> they<00:03:54.860> they<00:03:55.370> increased<00:03:55.970> the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
broken is that they they increased the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.760 
broken is that they they increased the
the<00:03:56.900> stock<00:03:57.310> weapon<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.520> stock<00:03:58.790> s12<00:03:59.470> fire<00:04:00.470> rate

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
the stock weapon the stock s12 fire rate

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.500 
the stock weapon the stock s12 fire rate
but<00:04:01.370> they<00:04:01.550> didn't<00:04:01.820> increase<00:04:02.090> any<00:04:02.300> of<00:04:02.420> the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
but they didn't increase any of the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.449 
but they didn't increase any of the
variance<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.380> weapon<00:04:03.740> variance<00:04:04.100> we're

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
variance so the weapon variance we're

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.070 
variance so the weapon variance we're
like<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.790> whole<00:04:05.000> big<00:04:05.209> deal<00:04:05.450> about<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.810> weapon

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
like the whole big deal about the weapon

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.860 
like the whole big deal about the weapon
Barry<00:04:06.290> is<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:07.130> has<00:04:07.940> increased<00:04:08.420> fire<00:04:08.630> rate

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
Barry is it has increased fire rate

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.980 
Barry is it has increased fire rate
actually<00:04:09.160> fires<00:04:10.160> slower<00:04:10.670> now<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.750> that

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
actually fires slower now like that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.980 
actually fires slower now like that
makes<00:04:12.290> no<00:04:12.590> sense<00:04:13.000> come<00:04:14.000> on<00:04:14.180> sledgehammer<00:04:14.750> like

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
makes no sense come on sledgehammer like

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.430 
makes no sense come on sledgehammer like
what<00:04:15.170> are<00:04:15.230> you<00:04:15.350> doing<00:04:16.540> EPM<00:04:17.540> 3<00:04:17.840> reduce<00:04:18.170> recoil

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
what are you doing EPM 3 reduce recoil

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.050 
what are you doing EPM 3 reduce recoil
this<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.920> like<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.220> fourth<00:04:19.520> time<00:04:19.609> they

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
this is like the fourth time they

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.180 
this is like the fourth time they
patched<00:04:20.359> this<00:04:20.570> weapon<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.230> reduced<00:04:21.890> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
patched this weapon and reduced the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.680 
patched this weapon and reduced the
recoil<00:04:22.760> as<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.090> guys<00:04:23.240> can't<00:04:23.479> tell<00:04:23.600> them

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
recoil as you guys can't tell them

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.260 
recoil as you guys can't tell them
making<00:04:23.840> air<00:04:24.050> flows<00:04:24.350> right<00:04:24.500> now<00:04:24.850> do<00:04:25.850> something

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
making air flows right now do something

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.390 
making air flows right now do something
else<00:04:26.419> like<00:04:26.630> obviously<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.530> weapon<00:04:27.860> like

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
else like obviously the weapon like

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.300 
else like obviously the weapon like
you're<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:28.729> not<00:04:28.820> doing

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
you're just not doing

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.040 
you're just not doing
like<00:04:29.520> if<00:04:29.640> this<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.210> fourth<00:04:30.510> time<00:04:30.630> you've

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
like if this is the fourth time you've

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.900 
like if this is the fourth time you've
patched<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.500> weapon<00:04:31.800> in<00:04:31.950> less<00:04:32.460> than<00:04:32.610> six

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
patched the weapon in less than six

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.120 
patched the weapon in less than six
months<00:04:33.090> you're<00:04:34.020> obviously<00:04:34.380> doing<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.920> wrong

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
months you're obviously doing it wrong

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.900 
months you're obviously doing it wrong
you<00:04:35.820> know<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.800> reduce<00:04:37.800> recoil<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.520> links

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
you know I reduce recoil on the links

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.780 
you know I reduce recoil on the links
okay<00:04:39.570> i<00:04:39.840> guess<00:04:40.290> i<00:04:40.680> mean<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.220> links<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.610> still

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
okay i guess i mean the links is still

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.860 
okay i guess i mean the links is still
gonna<00:04:41.970> suck<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:43.400> sm<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.610> slightly<00:04:45.360> reduced

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
gonna suck a sm one slightly reduced

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.230 
gonna suck a sm one slightly reduced
initial<00:04:46.350> fire<00:04:46.560> range<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:47.790> still<00:04:48.090> going

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
initial fire range this is still going

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.870 
initial fire range this is still going
to<00:04:48.300> be<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.600> best<00:04:49.260> weapon<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.770> game<00:04:49.920> you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
to be the best weapon in the game you

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.640 
to be the best weapon in the game you
can<00:04:51.030> slightly<00:04:51.300> reduce<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.900> initial<00:04:52.440> fire

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
can slightly reduce the initial fire

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.290 
can slightly reduce the initial fire
rate<00:04:52.890> but<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.400> needs<00:04:53.580> more<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.940> nerf<00:04:54.120> than

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
rate but it needs more of a nerf than

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.970 
rate but it needs more of a nerf than
that<00:04:54.450> i'm<00:04:54.570> sorry<00:04:54.750> just<00:04:55.080> cut<00:04:55.350> back<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.770> three

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
that i'm sorry just cut back the three

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.620 
that i'm sorry just cut back the three
shot<00:04:56.190> kill<00:04:56.430> range<00:04:56.580> just<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.850> little<00:04:57.150> bit<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.450> feel

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
shot kill range just a little bit I feel

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.470 
shot kill range just a little bit I feel
like<00:04:57.780> hey<00:04:58.410> someone<00:04:58.920> has<00:04:59.310> just<00:04:59.790> too<00:05:00.030> far<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.420> a

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
like hey someone has just too far of a

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.570 
like hey someone has just too far of a
three<00:05:00.690> shot<00:05:00.840> kill<00:05:01.050> range<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.770> ASM<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.370> should

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
three shot kill range the ASM one should

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.540 
three shot kill range the ASM one should
not<00:05:02.730> be<00:05:02.940> beating<00:05:03.620> like<00:05:04.620> most<00:05:04.920> assault<00:05:05.250> rifle

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
not be beating like most assault rifle

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.760 
not be beating like most assault rifle
ings<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:05.880> just<00:05:06.360> it<00:05:06.510> seems<00:05:06.750> like<00:05:06.990> laziness<00:05:07.440> and

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
ings I just it seems like laziness and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.230 
ings I just it seems like laziness and
then<00:05:08.520> there's<00:05:08.670> like<00:05:08.760> all<00:05:09.030> these<00:05:09.180> other
