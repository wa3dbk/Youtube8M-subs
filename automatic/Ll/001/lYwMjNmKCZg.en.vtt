where I think it shines is I'm actually
the<00:01:26.550> constant<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.740> crunch<00:01:29.010> setting<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
the constant the crunch setting it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.310 
the constant the crunch setting it
really<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> straight<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.080> good

i'm<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.680> show<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.890> its<00:02:58.160> which<00:02:58.310> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
i'm going to show you its which is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.030 
i'm going to show you its which is
between<00:02:58.580> clean<00:02:59.030> crunch<00:02:59.450> lead<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
between clean crunch lead and and the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.130 
between clean crunch lead and and the
loop<00:03:04.390> will<00:03:05.390> model<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.020> you're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
loop will model is this that you're

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.810 
loop will model is this that you're
showing<00:03:06.410> us<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.160> model<00:03:07.370> showing<00:03:07.580> now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
showing us now and the model showing now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.040 
showing us now and the model showing now
is<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> 3<00:03:08.780> 3<00:03:08.810> 3<00:03:09.080> XL<00:03:09.920> cool<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.330> one<00:03:11.510> above<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.020> a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
is a 3 3 3 XL cool the one above it is a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.670 
is a 3 3 3 XL cool the one above it is a
333<00:03:13.150> all<00:03:14.150> three<00:03:14.660> chin<00:03:14.930> totally<00:03:15.440> three

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
333 all three chin totally three

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.340 
333 all three chin totally three
independent<00:03:16.190> channels<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.600> has<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> few

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
independent channels this one has a few

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.990 
independent channels this one has a few
features<00:03:18.500> less<00:03:18.950> than<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> XL<00:03:19.580> model

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
features less than the XL model

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.430 
features less than the XL model
basically<00:03:20.210> you<00:03:20.840> don't<00:03:20.990> have<00:03:21.110> an<00:03:21.200> overall

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
basically you don't have an overall

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.960 
basically you don't have an overall
presence<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.070> don't<00:03:22.250> get<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> noise<00:03:22.640> gate

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
presence you don't get the noise gate

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.850 
presence you don't get the noise gate
and<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.570> will<00:03:23.750> get<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.020> excel<00:03:24.350> switch<00:03:24.650> which

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
and it will get the excel switch which

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.370 
and it will get the excel switch which
is<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.070> kind<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.880> mid-range<00:03:26.120> Bubba<00:03:26.720> sustain

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
is a kind of mid-range Bubba sustain

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.000 
is a kind of mid-range Bubba sustain
type<00:03:27.680> boost<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.900> going<00:03:30.170> with<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> clean<00:03:30.650> channel

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
type boost so going with a clean channel

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.730 
type boost so going with a clean channel
first<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.580> one<00:03:34.820> isn't<00:03:35.470> fully<00:03:36.470> just

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
first and this one isn't fully just

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:50.089 
first and this one isn't fully just
totally<00:03:37.130> clean<00:03:37.630> no<00:03:38.630> way<00:03:38.780> too<00:03:38.840> dirty

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.850 

and<00:03:51.099> then<00:03:51.730> get<00:03:51.970> into<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> other<00:03:52.420> channel<00:03:52.860> go

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
and then get into the other channel go

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.199 
and then get into the other channel go
to<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.069> crunch<00:03:54.430> channel<00:03:54.819> now<00:03:54.909> I<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.120> the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
to the crunch channel now I have the

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.759 
to the crunch channel now I have the
Excel<00:03:55.510> switch<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:56.019> here<00:03:56.290> which<00:03:56.439> is<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:56.680> to

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
Excel switch on here which is going to

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.220 
Excel switch on here which is going to
add<00:03:56.950> some<00:03:56.980> mid<00:03:57.340> range<00:03:57.549> but<00:03:57.819> on<00:03:58.629> both<00:03:59.049> these

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
add some mid range but on both these

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.949 
add some mid range but on both these
channels<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.799> EQ<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.420> extremely<00:04:01.420> active<00:04:01.629> and

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
about that is that it's still even

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.380 
about that is that it's still even
though<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:12.670> super<00:05:12.910> high<00:05:13.000> gain<00:05:13.240> it

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
though it was super high gain it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.610 
though it was super high gain it
retained<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.840> characteristics<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.530> the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
retained the characteristics of the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.100 
retained the characteristics of the
guitar<00:05:14.920> you<00:05:15.280> know<00:05:15.400> it's<00:05:15.790> not<00:05:15.880> just<00:05:16.030> fuzz<00:05:16.690> yeah

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
guitar you know it's not just fuzz yeah

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.260

I<00:05:17.380> mean<00:05:17.590> it's<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:18.220> lot<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.490> gain<00:05:18.820> but<00:05:19.120> it's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
I mean it's a lot of gain but it's

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.940 
I mean it's a lot of gain but it's
cascaded<00:05:19.900> gained<00:05:20.080> through<00:05:20.320> tubes<00:05:20.590> and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
cascaded gained through tubes and

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.680 
cascaded gained through tubes and
whatnot<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:21.820> not<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.270> doesn't<00:05:22.300> sound

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
whatnot and it's not it doesn't sound

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.300 
whatnot and it's not it doesn't sound
like<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.840> pedal<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.590> know<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.740> still<00:05:24.040> get<00:05:24.190> the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
like a pedal you know you still get the

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.950 
like a pedal you know you still get the
definition<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.030> clarity<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.720> tone<00:05:25.930> of

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
definition the clarity and the tone of

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.380 
definition the clarity and the tone of
the<00:05:26.140> guitar<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.980> know<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.190> know<00:05:27.970> if<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.180> plug

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
the guitar you know you know if you plug

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.060 
the guitar you know you know if you plug
different<00:05:28.690> guitars<00:05:28.990> in<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.320> changes<00:05:29.770> its<00:05:29.920> not

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
different guitars in it changes its not

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.500 
different guitars in it changes its not
like<00:05:30.190> homogeneous<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.000> whatever<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.330> plug

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
like homogeneous to whatever you plug

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.440 
like homogeneous to whatever you plug
into<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:33.010> cool<00:05:33.280> like<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.910> each

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
into it so it's cool like that and each

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.990 
into it so it's cool like that and each
of<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.720> models<00:05:34.900> our<00:05:35.170> heads<00:05:35.610> there's<00:05:36.610> there's

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
of the models our heads there's there's

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.860 
of the models our heads there's there's
four<00:05:37.300> models<00:05:37.770> they<00:05:38.770> all<00:05:38.920> come<00:05:39.190> as<00:05:39.490> 212<00:05:40.390> combos
