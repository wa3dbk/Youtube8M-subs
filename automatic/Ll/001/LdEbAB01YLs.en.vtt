00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
against the Kakashi squadron I guess or

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.150 
against the Kakashi squadron I guess or
the<00:00:22.289> portion<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> army<00:00:23.580> that's<00:00:25.160> ordered

by<00:00:26.460> Kakashi<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:28.519> it<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.269> unfair<00:00:31.019> for

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
by Kakashi and it was very unfair for

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.500 
by Kakashi and it was very unfair for
the<00:00:32.480> shinobi<00:00:33.480> alliance<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.510> two

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the shinobi alliance for like the two

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350 
the shinobi alliance for like the two
thirds<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> battle<00:00:37.890> basically<00:00:38.489> because

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
thirds of the battle basically because

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.270

Joanie's just get slaughtered

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
Joanie's just get slaughtered
immediately<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> um<00:01:32.430> yeah<00:01:33.360> whatever<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
immediately but but um yeah whatever the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
immediately but but um yeah whatever the
fight<00:01:34.710> was<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.790> good<00:01:36.000> towards

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
fight was actually pretty good towards

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
fight was actually pretty good towards
the<00:01:36.570> end<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.960> had<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.170> couple<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.979> flashbacks<00:01:38.640> but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the end I had a couple of flashbacks but

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
the end I had a couple of flashbacks but
I<00:01:39.000> guess<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.369> expected

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
I guess that was that was to be expected

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.789 
I guess that was that was to be expected
since<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.479> can't<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.990> fillers<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
since they can't really do fillers in

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.249 
since they can't really do fillers in
the<00:01:44.250> win<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> war<00:01:45.060> arc<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the win the war arc so they have to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
the win the war arc so they have to
resort<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> flashbacks<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.970> cannot<00:01:48.329> fill<00:01:48.600> up

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
resort to flashbacks just cannot fill up

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
resort to flashbacks just cannot fill up
the<00:01:48.930> time<00:01:49.340> towards<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.340> end<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.909> see

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
