00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.180
 hi girls, how are you like a picture 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.940
 is worth more than a thousand words I will teach 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.620
 a little bit how berlocq works 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 agreement is to know what you have to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.710
 I have spoken this is the truth of the leader 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.380
 exactly then let's start 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 teaching by telling light the light is what 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 give the contact so that the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.150
 press fabrics or lift by the party 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.650
 right we put lateral we want to sew 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:42.190
 and I really do not know if you can travel as 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:45.449
 when sewing the remaining piece 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.449
 I do not know 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.350
 this is the berlocq stitch I do not know if 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.990
 you can appreciate it well 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 straight 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.320
 and the reverse on the cover of seeing him to see 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.450
 unesco is with three Chinese or with 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.390
 four and in this case I have three because 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.560
 I use it only to finish well 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.120
 you can sew on the stitch at the same time 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.480
 finish is look at this 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400
 is the machine zig zag is that I do not know about 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.180
 all right 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.820
 and this is the berlocq stitch to see if 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.360
 you can see the difference 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.729
 if this elastic difference is that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 Fabric is flat, it's not worth it, but look 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.310
 the elastic fabric is great this is a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.229
 zigzag made with sewing machine 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.820
 flat does not yield and stretches jce does not yield anything 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.820
 you are going to see now in the in the ubr lock 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:57.130
 because this is the starting point 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.490
 It can be liter of swimsuits 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.509
 it is appreciated 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.509
 the difference 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 this continues pulling that this does not give more 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.210
 of itself 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.170
 OK 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.240
 It was great to sew great point 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.910
 you can only finish what you can do 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.600
 sewing stitch in this case we would say 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.600
 the two 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.780
 we would place it in the cantito de la 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.530
 blade that has a blade that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.660
 cut the fabric 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.660
 that's why it's so polished guilt and things 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.130
 in fact the point 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 you see it is perfectly possible but 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.269
 also if we put is not second needle 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.430
 here I'm going to zoom in a bit 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.930
 to see if you can see it 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.930
 yes a needle now 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.989
 now 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.269
 because here you can place a second 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.000
 needle then what I would do is 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.190
 Security stitch at the same time cuts us 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.230
 here we are with the stitch 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.770
 of security the two things agree 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.380
 OK 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.820
 it's basically seeing it work two and 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.300
 the three and four and the opposite to 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.510
 use it with three threads because it is the 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.050
 basic point to polish and finish can you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.050
 also read 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 it only remains to live 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.019
 we can adjust the width of the stitch 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.629
 and this is a good they continue to be 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.639
 elastic this with a machine zig zag 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.090
 I would never get it and we will stay 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.090
 sewing 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.970
 go 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.400
 then the only complication as os 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.080
 I have commented to celebrate I am going to be a 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 little bit inside the machine 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.370
 you scare these quotes are 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.840
 essential to be able to manipulate 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.440
 inside I'm going to close the light to see if 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.440
 you see it better 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.420
 this is the container where they end up 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.790
 the scraps the pieces that we cut 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.160
 of cloth this goes after the garbage 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 and this is the inside of the see it 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.790
 if you notice this, we need to 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.889
 manipulate the thread inside according 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.249
 here are some graphics 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.900
 let's see if I can see a little 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:32.900
 here are some graphics that teach you 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:42.260
 how to thread because really 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:46.110
 it's a complication and this with light and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.780
 the light you see the path of the thread 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.780
 until you get to the top and then this happens 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.310
 inside internally the only 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.670
 complication is threading this machine 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.530
 otherwise it is very comfortable and if you 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.689
 dedicate to the world of posture you the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.729
 he strongly advised 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:07.330
 It has cost me a lot to buy many 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.100
 but it works beautifully 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.930
 all right 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.460
 come then nothing any query that 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.980
 have you can put them in contact 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.730
 with me 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:21.170
 I will help what you need according to 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.170
 have a hug everyone until then
