the parts and designed to put the
computer<00:00:28.189> together<00:00:28.699> ourselves

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
computer together ourselves

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.390 
computer together ourselves
now<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.050> hard<00:00:30.350> part<00:00:30.380> is<00:00:30.680> done<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.189> all<00:00:31.279> we

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
now the hard part is done and all we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.679 
now the hard part is done and all we
need<00:00:31.519> to<00:00:31.640> do<00:00:31.789> is<00:00:32.000> learn<00:00:32.119> how<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.360> put<00:00:32.599> together

need to do is learn how to put together

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.200 
need to do is learn how to put together
all<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.230> parts<00:00:33.400> if<00:00:34.400> we<00:00:34.580> did<00:00:34.760> our<00:00:34.850> planning

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
all the parts if we did our planning

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.090 
all the parts if we did our planning
well<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.600> got<00:00:35.750> all<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.989> right<00:00:36.140> parts<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.949> go

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
well and got all the right parts that go

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.070 
well and got all the right parts that go
together<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:37.940> will<00:00:38.120> be<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.269> piece<00:00:38.449> of<00:00:38.629> cake<00:00:38.809> if

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
together this will be a piece of cake if

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.470 
together this will be a piece of cake if
we<00:00:39.890> are<00:00:40.010> missing<00:00:40.340> some<00:00:40.489> parts<00:00:40.640> or<00:00:40.970> got<00:00:41.330> the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
we are missing some parts or got the

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.150 
we are missing some parts or got the
wrong<00:00:41.629> part<00:00:41.900> then<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:42.800> where<00:00:42.949> we<00:00:42.980> will

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
wrong part then this is where we will

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.830 
wrong part then this is where we will
figure<00:00:43.339> out<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.270> wrong<00:00:44.420> part<00:00:44.690> was

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
figure out that the wrong part was

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.440 
figure out that the wrong part was
purchased<00:00:45.230> very<00:00:45.469> quickly<00:00:45.739> also<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.239> case

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
purchased very quickly also if the case

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.030 
purchased very quickly also if the case
we<00:00:47.629> got<00:00:47.660> did<00:00:48.020> not<00:00:48.140> come<00:00:48.350> with<00:00:48.500> enough<00:00:48.739> screws

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
we got did not come with enough screws

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.069 
we got did not come with enough screws
or<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.370> right<00:00:49.520> screws<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.480> will<00:00:50.600> figure<00:00:50.809> it

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
or the right screws we will figure it

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.250 
or the right screws we will figure it
out<00:00:51.110> here<00:00:51.770> as<00:00:51.920> well<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:53.539> let's<00:00:53.719> get<00:00:53.870> started

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
out here as well so let's get started

first<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:55.520> will<00:00:55.640> briefly<00:00:55.910> go<00:00:56.090> through<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
first I will briefly go through the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.420 
first I will briefly go through the
parts<00:00:56.780> that<00:00:56.870> we<00:00:57.110> should<00:00:57.320> have<00:00:57.500> bought<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.280> put

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
parts that we should have bought to put

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
computer and I know there's going to be

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.309 
computer and I know there's going to be
at<00:03:09.299> least<00:03:09.389> one<00:03:09.659> person<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:10.079> there<00:03:10.139> that's

at least one person out there that's
like<00:03:10.709> oh<00:03:10.920> my<00:03:11.129> computer<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.670> awesome<00:03:12.090> drool

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
like oh my computer so awesome drool

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.330 
like oh my computer so awesome drool
drool<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.739> thought<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> should

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
drool a little so I thought I should

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.289 
drool a little so I thought I should
mention<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:15.840> somehow<00:03:16.560> water<00:03:17.069> oil<00:03:17.459> from
