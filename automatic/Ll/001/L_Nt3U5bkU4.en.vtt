an intense modification it may seem
silly<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.049> tongue<00:01:19.799> sweating<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.820> really

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
silly but tongue sweating is a really

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
silly but tongue sweating is a really
intense<00:01:21.420> process<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> gotten<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
intense process and had I gotten this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
intense process and had I gotten this
done<00:01:23.310> runs<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.729> younger<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659

heavy<00:01:36.540> modification<00:01:37.439> while<00:01:37.710> under<00:01:38.040> 18

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
heavy modification while under 18

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.090 
heavy modification while under 18
because<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.600> idea

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
because it's just not a good idea

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
because it's just not a good idea
these<00:01:41.100> things<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.700> permanent<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.509> could

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
these things are permanent I could

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510 
these things are permanent I could
probably<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:43.829> tongues<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.189> put<00:01:44.369> back

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
probably have my tongues but put back

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310 
probably have my tongues but put back
together<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> long<00:01:45.390> run<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.200> be

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
together in a long run but it would be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670 
together in a long run but it would be
dangerous<00:01:46.850> painful<00:01:47.850> expensive<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.350> very

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
dangerous painful expensive and a very

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.940 
dangerous painful expensive and a very
bad<00:01:49.920> idea<00:01:50.810> which<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.840> why<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> waited<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
bad idea which is why I waited for a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
bad idea which is why I waited for a
very<00:01:53.189> long<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.060> tongue<00:01:54.270> split<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
very long time to get my tongue split I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
very long time to get my tongue split I
wanted<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.290> years<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> years<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> years
