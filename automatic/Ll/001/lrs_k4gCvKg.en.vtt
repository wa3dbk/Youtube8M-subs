00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in the Americas with his name 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.810
 associated with many human victims their 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.429
 lightning deadly accuracy 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.170
 throw and the strongest poison she doesn't 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.199
 leaves its victims no chance 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 this copy of the bare snake went hunting 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.710
 sticking out the sting she catches in the air 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 trail of smell that leaves behind 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.330
 any moving game perhaps you dare 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 odor particles enter organ 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.490
 jacobson is in the serpent's mouth 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 this way the snake gets the information 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.300
 necessary for her to go on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.300
 next to the smell this smell leads to mink 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.809
 around the mink usually remains a lot 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.520
 odorous traces of both old and more recent 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.960
 if the snake catches the rodent in the lantern 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.960
 dinner is provided for her 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 unexpected attack is the best weapon as well 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.120
 snake heads 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.719
 rodent trapped in 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.309
 own house will have nowhere to run on 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.309
 only if the rodent lives there 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.740
 and this is not a rodent 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 this goliath tarantula is the largest spider in 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 the world 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.110
 the duel will be without rules and to death but 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.110
 who will win it 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 tarantula goliath whose foot length is slightly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 Does not exceed the diameter of the deep deep 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.430
 deadly giant giant in 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.430
 the invertebrate world 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 this 8 killer eye doesn't matter and 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.719
 vision but he has 8 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.700
 hypersensitive legs lower segments 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.600
 legs covered with microscopic hairs 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.549
 the so-called 3-battery hairs 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.520
 rotate freely in thicket shaped 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.350
 pits and catch the smallest vibrations 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.030
 airflow changes it's him 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.990
 main tool for determining 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.579
 victim information comes in every 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.039
 spider leg at regular intervals 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:14.829
 time allowing it to accurately calculate 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:16.540
 future mining location then 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.250
 goliath carefully steals on 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.079
 distance from which can make 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 lightning fast throw and float their 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.340
 deadly fangs 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.900
 you have three as needles canines 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.580
 be up to 2 and a half centimeters long 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.260
 inside they are hollow through them the poison flows down 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.640
 which quickly paralyzes the victim and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.990
 starts to dissolve it from the inside 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.090
 acting fanged like a hoe spider 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.709
 rips the victim apart and grinds 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.709
 in easily digestible purees 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.440
 tarantulas often settle in abandoned 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.650
 rodents burrow 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.240
 danger of eating their prey allocates 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.790
 silk thread tarantulas do not weave web 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.260
 for catching prey and wraps it in 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 your victim to not get lost 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.810
 individual pieces and and dissolving body 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.110
 copies of the head I'm a snake just as dangerous 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.850
 a predator like a tarantula adult snakes themselves 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.739
 looking for prey and young 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.110
 prefer to lie in wait and wait 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.239
 opportunity a young snake slowly 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.680
 wiggled white with the tip of the tail imitates 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:33.180
 worm movement at the sight of this frog 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.180
 unable to resist the temptation 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.700
 fret and snake reacts instantly 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.700
 hitting the victim with deadly poison 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.870
 adults copy heads and snakes reaching 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.010
 two and a half meters long snake to us 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.010
 the kingdom has very few enemies 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.130
 after the smell led this snake to mink 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.130
 now you need to collect all the information 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.959
 there are many traces of a rodent here but they are all 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.079
 old means mink may turn out to be 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.970
 the serpent empty in the hole loses its 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.350
 benefits there may be too few 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.030
 places to turn or attack the snake for now 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.800
 can't determine who is hiding down 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.370
 but the tarantula has already felt it 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.370
 presence 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.370
 giant tarantulas in front of their burrows 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.550
 put up a kind of fence of thread 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.550
 cobwebs 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.770
 they are located so that the spider caught 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.730
 any movement and on the principle of action 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:55.620
 resemble azure alarm spear 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.660
 the head i snake slips into suspense 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.470
 I do not suspect that it is already a security case 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.419
 alarm and spider got 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.419
 warning of its approach 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.090
 however, in the pits on the sides of the head of this snake 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.690
 Sensitive thermal 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.520
 sensors 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.560
 assisting with hunting 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.660
 warm-blooded mammals in their dark 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.970
 mink but the local lodger is not 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.110
 mammal 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.480
 sensitive hairs on spider legs 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.580
 have already told him all sizes of speed 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.810
 movement and location uninvited 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.030
 guest and he prepares for assault fullness 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:47.650
 information and surprise attacks give 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:50.140
 tarantula all the benefits before 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.720
 the snake manages to respond the spider introduces 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.580
 in it a fatal dose of poison paralyzing 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.220
 the liquid begins to act dissolve 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.180
 snake's internal organs inflict retaliatory 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.720
 kick too late and after a few 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.100
 minutes 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.100
 the snake is already dead 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.930
 and u eat the menu starting from the head and 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.290
 then sucking up all its dissolving 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.290
 body 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.449
 after 17 hours from the cop of a snake 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.250
 there is only an empty skin 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.270
 in tarantula cleaning up his house 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.270
 takes out the trash
