00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello my name is message and 11 years 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm throwing you a joy challenge I was not leaving 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.250
 cape of aerobatic jump gaza 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.170
 who knows us the heroes of shoes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.340
 from the pool to the incredible but 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 not for acrobatic jumpers 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 catapulted at 80 km / h on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 jumps of 5 meters is crazy desert 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.420
 chained the figures to more than 15 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.949
 meters high a snow discipline 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 and water or courage and rivers 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.039
 Freestyle skiing is a sport 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.080
 relatively young appeared in the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 80s with the first 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.219
 Olympic Games demonstrations in 80 mg 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.020
 and in calgary and it was official so 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.700
 by the feast at the Olympics in 94 on 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 or there will not initially be a little 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.670
 trampoline to be a good jumper the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
 main quality let's say it's 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 acrobatics acrobatics it's either in there 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
 being from gymnastics disciplines 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 or trampoline or so that is practiced and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 we can not be a good jumper 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.910
 acrobatic if we neglect acrobatics up 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.330
 tac agree softly and these are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.820
 hands on the sides there we took too much 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.229
 polite we will go to the small to see and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 that we play at the office and shoes of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 ski it gives that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.960
 we will put one will make your you go 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 so put wax on the on the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 sole to facilitate're slides 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.070
 on the boom what as on the soft 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.829
 like on skis on the snow 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.569
 exactly the same it is cold that has 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.069
 What is there then there I Tropez 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.120
 just my skis to cool the 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.710
 end of courage 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.990
 go now towards the little 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.210
 stepping stone for the first jump jo-ann a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.730
 instead of concentration and 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.750
 visualization we are in fact 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.510
 close your eyes and try to 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.770
 visualize the jump the small movements 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.810
 the little details that will make the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.430
 difference 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 who are you kidding me about 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.670
 to say yes I'm not going well 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.320
 to say yes I was stable on your 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.610
 okay legs you do not look in 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.160
 down you look in front 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.700
 so the jv you're going to look at you 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.700
 will have to let you slip 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.670
 he still deserves the first he has 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 past the springboard he fell on the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.190
 feet you like it and it's scary 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.310
 now go harder a 360 degrees 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.830
 and with your right arm okay you'll 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.830
 go get on the side like that she 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.540
 because with the little experience he 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.370
 a and we really made a beautiful 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.019
 demonstration for those who would like 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.459
 to get started we can start from 12 years 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.900
 and to reach the level of the lawsuits 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.269
 five hours of training a day 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.049
