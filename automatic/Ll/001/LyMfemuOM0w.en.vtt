hey all its micro I'm back again with a
bit<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> proof-of-concept<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:06.080> if<00:00:07.080> you

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
bit of a proof-of-concept so if you

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.640 
bit of a proof-of-concept so if you
watch<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.010> lot<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.189> vortex<00:00:08.910> streams<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:10.080> Twitch

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
watch a lot of vortex streams on Twitch

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.160 
watch a lot of vortex streams on Twitch
you'll<00:00:10.980> notice<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.490> he<00:00:11.790> has<00:00:11.880> been<00:00:12.170> getting

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.160 
you'll notice that he has been getting
somewhat<00:00:13.650> back<00:00:13.889> into<00:00:15.859> runescape<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
somewhat back into runescape so I

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.060 
somewhat back into runescape so I
decided<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.880> I'm<00:00:20.880> bored<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:22.109> runescape

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
decided that I'm bored I like runescape

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.529 
decided that I'm bored I like runescape
I<00:00:23.340> don't<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.820> play<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> much

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I don't really play it all that much

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.019 
I don't really play it all that much
because<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.849> gotten<00:00:26.849> bad<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> figured<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
because it's gotten bad and I figured I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
because it's gotten bad and I figured I
also<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.630> minecraft<00:00:31.080> why<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.410> try<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.740> make

my<00:00:52.920> mining<00:00:53.460> you'll<00:00:53.610> notice<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.090> the

level<00:00:58.379> 6<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.329> plan<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.359> making<00:01:00.690> levels<00:01:01.199> harder

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
level 6 I plan on making levels harder

level 6 I plan on making levels harder
to<00:01:01.920> achieve<00:01:02.600> eventually<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.320> just

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to achieve eventually but this is just

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.270 
to achieve eventually but this is just
again<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> proof-of-concept<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.570> rough<00:01:07.280> plan

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
again a proof-of-concept very rough plan

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.789 
again a proof-of-concept very rough plan
and<00:01:08.460> making<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> more<00:01:08.909> efficient<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.140> go

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and making it more efficient so I go

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
and making it more efficient so I go
ahead<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.340> mining<00:01:11.729> iron<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.420> pick<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
ahead I'm mining iron I pick it up for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.490 
ahead I'm mining iron I pick it up for
later<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.000> whatever<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> replace<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
later so whatever and replace it with a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
later so whatever and replace it with a
and<00:01:17.180> emptied<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.920> unable<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.340> used<00:01:20.369> stone

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and emptied out unable to be used stone

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
and emptied out unable to be used stone
which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.409> later<00:01:22.740> replaced<00:01:23.009> after<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.549> bit

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
which is then later replaced after a bit

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.749 
which is then later replaced after a bit
of<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.110> warm-up<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> cool-down<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.580> if

it cools after it cooled down time door
replace<00:01:53.579> itself<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.960> mined

replace itself I know it can be mined

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.249 
replace itself I know it can be mined
again<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> notice<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.479> mining<00:01:58.110> level

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
again and if you notice my mining level

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.580 
again and if you notice my mining level
is<00:01:58.680> slowly<00:01:59.630> going<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:03.659> looks<00:02:03.810> level<00:02:04.200> 10

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is slowly going up that looks level 10

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
is slowly going up that looks level 10
and<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.729> figure<00:02:06.030> why<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.869> show<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.539> stuff

this<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:44.590> because<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> test

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
this one because I can and I have a test

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.820 
this one because I can and I have a test
for<00:02:48.070> block<00:02:48.610> 5<00:02:49.180> blocks<00:02:49.540> above<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.080> one<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:50.560> an

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
for block 5 blocks above this one for an

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
for block 5 blocks above this one for an
air<00:02:51.070> block<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.640> every<00:02:51.940> time<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:54.640> every<00:02:55.480> time

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
air block so every time there every time

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.410 
air block so every time there every time
this<00:02:56.530> iron<00:02:57.040> block<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.550> replaced<00:02:57.940> with<00:02:58.030> an<00:02:58.239> air

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
this iron block is replaced with an air

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.740 
this iron block is replaced with an air
block<00:02:58.630> it'll<00:02:59.560> send<00:03:00.250> off<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> pulse<00:03:00.760> which<00:03:01.480> goes

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
block it'll send off a pulse which goes

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.800 
block it'll send off a pulse which goes
into<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.200> block<00:03:02.700> which<00:03:03.700> goes<00:03:04.000> off<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.510> add

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
into this block which goes off to add

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.009 
into this block which goes off to add
the<00:03:05.560> closest<00:03:05.980> player<00:03:06.280> one<00:03:06.910> level<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.780> their

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the closest player one level in their

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.520 
the closest player one level in their
remaining<00:03:08.290> level<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.840> replaces<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.290> block

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
remaining level and replaces the block

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.550 
remaining level and replaces the block
with<00:03:12.390> stone<00:03:15.180> which<00:03:16.180> after<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.200> sends<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
with stone which after that it sends a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.350 
with stone which after that it sends a
pulse<00:03:17.739> out<00:03:18.010> around<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.489> way<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.239> make

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
pulse out around this way I can make

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630 
pulse out around this way I can make
longer<00:03:19.829> probably<00:03:20.829> going<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.100> come<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.370> some

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
longer probably going to come with some

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.420 
longer probably going to come with some
sort<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.970> more<00:03:22.780> efficient<00:03:23.200> way<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.380> set<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
sort of more efficient way to set up the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.330 
sort of more efficient way to set up the
pulse<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.870> replaces<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.920> stone

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
pulse and this one replaces that stone

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.020 
pulse and this one replaces that stone
block<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:28.030> an<00:03:28.360> iron<00:03:29.260> ore<00:03:29.590> block<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:30.610> rather

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
block with an iron ore block it's rather

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.090 
block with an iron ore block it's rather
simple<00:03:31.360> again<00:03:31.840> just<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.140> proof-of-concept<00:03:32.530> I

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
simple again just a proof-of-concept I

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.940 
simple again just a proof-of-concept I
plan<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.459> making<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:33.970> more<00:03:34.120> efficient<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.739> I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
plan on making it more efficient but I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.470 
plan on making it more efficient but I
was<00:03:36.160> bored<00:03:36.549> had<00:03:36.790> nothing<00:03:37.060> better<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.269> do<00:03:37.450> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
was bored had nothing better to do I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.319 
was bored had nothing better to do I
figured<00:03:37.870> I'll<00:03:37.989> show<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.860> off<00:03:39.010> that's<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.030> much

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
figured I'll show it off that's not much

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.079 
figured I'll show it off that's not much
but
