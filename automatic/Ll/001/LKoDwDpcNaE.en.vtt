00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
of the unboxing of that I showed you

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.430 
of the unboxing of that I showed you
that<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:29.080> trays<00:00:29.980> have<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.820> large<00:00:31.300> grate<00:00:32.199> on

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
that the trays have a large grate on

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.939 
that the trays have a large grate on
them

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
them

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.090 
them
I<00:00:32.980> mean<00:00:33.220> unusually<00:00:33.790> large<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.890> really

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
I mean unusually large and you really

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.160 
I mean unusually large and you really
can't<00:00:36.309> do<00:00:36.489> small<00:00:36.790> items<00:00:37.150> like<00:00:37.239> peas<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.900> corn

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
can't do small items like peas and corn

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.530 
can't do small items like peas and corn
because<00:00:38.440> they'll<00:00:38.620> fall<00:00:38.890> through<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:40.390> then

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
because they'll fall through and then

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.840 
because they'll fall through and then
some<00:00:40.809> stuff<00:00:41.080> that's<00:00:41.350> okay<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.340> sit<00:00:42.550> on<00:00:42.640> there

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
some stuff that's okay to sit on there

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.430 
some stuff that's okay to sit on there
as<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.090> dehydrates<00:00:43.660> might<00:00:43.870> become<00:00:44.170> small

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
as it dehydrates might become small

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.930 
as it dehydrates might become small
enough<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.860> fall<00:00:45.100> through<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:45.790> just

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
enough to fall through and it just

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.689 
enough to fall through and it just
because<00:00:46.239> it's<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.420> problem<00:00:46.839> so<00:00:47.670> Waring<00:00:48.670> Pro

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
because it's a problem so Waring Pro

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.320 
because it's a problem so Waring Pro
gives<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.269> these<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.879> like<00:00:51.909> a<00:00:52.030> silicone

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
gives you these it's like a silicone

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.259 
gives you these it's like a silicone
tray<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.500> guess<00:00:54.280> it's<00:00:54.430> designed<00:00:54.790> for<00:00:54.879> fruit

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
tray I guess it's designed for fruit

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.530 
tray I guess it's designed for fruit
roll-ups<00:00:55.870> or<00:00:56.170> fruit<00:00:56.979> leather<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:57.729> know

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
roll-ups or fruit leather and you know

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.049 
roll-ups or fruit leather and you know
it<00:00:59.260> would<00:00:59.680> work<00:00:59.860> I<00:01:00.100> can<00:01:00.280> put<00:01:00.430> peas<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.879> stuff

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
it would work I can put peas and stuff

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.820 
it would work I can put peas and stuff
on<00:01:01.210> there<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:01.540> they<00:01:01.629> only<00:01:01.780> give<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.140> one<00:01:02.500> and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
on there but they only give you one and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.060 
on there but they only give you one and
they're<00:01:03.790> expensive<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.780> mean<00:01:05.710> they're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
they're expensive I mean they're

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.649 
they're expensive I mean they're
ridiculous<00:01:06.580> just<00:01:06.970> five<00:01:07.150> trays<00:01:07.450> they

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
ridiculous just five trays they

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.330 
ridiculous just five trays they
should've<00:01:07.930> gave<00:01:08.049> you<00:01:08.170> five<00:01:08.440> but<00:01:09.070> they<00:01:09.190> give

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
should've gave you five but they give

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.770 
should've gave you five but they give
you<00:01:09.370> one<00:01:09.640> because<00:01:10.120> you<00:01:10.210> know<00:01:10.240> how<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.570> works

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
you one because you know how that works

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
perfect size okay and what I did is I

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.890 
perfect size okay and what I did is I
traced<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.240> fruit<00:01:52.810> roll-up<00:01:53.350> tray<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.900> cut

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
traced that fruit roll-up tray and cut

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.520 
traced that fruit roll-up tray and cut
it<00:01:56.020> out<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:57.310> got<00:01:57.490> this<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.960> what<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.320> does

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
it out and I got this and what that does

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.610 
it out and I got this and what that does
is<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.920> sits<00:02:00.220> right<00:02:00.280> there<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.110> perfect

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
is that sits right there it's a perfect

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.420 
is that sits right there it's a perfect
fit<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:03.040> mean<00:02:03.190> -<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:04.050> edge<00:02:05.050> but<00:02:06.040> that's<00:02:06.190> hard

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
fit I mean - the edge but that's hard

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430 
fit I mean - the edge but that's hard
plastic<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.480> you<00:02:07.510> can<00:02:07.840> see<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.259> that's

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
plastic so you can see this and that's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680 
plastic so you can see this and that's
nothing<00:02:08.679> never<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:09.099> fall<00:02:09.310> through<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.569> it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
nothing never can fall through so it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.600 
nothing never can fall through so it
worked<00:02:10.840> out<00:02:11.019> perfectly<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.860> got<00:02:12.069> rid<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610

big holes and made little small holes

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.380 
big holes and made little small holes
that<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.099> air<00:02:18.220> can<00:02:18.430> still<00:02:18.640> circulate<00:02:19.150> through

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that the air can still circulate through

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.849 
that the air can still circulate through
and<00:02:19.540> like<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.750> put<00:02:19.930> peas<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.319> corn<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.739> all

that these are so if it doesn't work how
I<00:03:18.100> mean<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:18.970> was<00:03:19.060> only<00:03:19.270> 69<00:03:19.600> cents<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.200> wasted

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
I mean it was only 69 cents I wasted

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.240 
I mean it was only 69 cents I wasted
okay<00:03:21.210> but<00:03:22.470> I'm<00:03:23.470> not<00:03:23.530> really<00:03:23.800> sure<00:03:23.980> if<00:03:24.070> that's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
okay but I'm not really sure if that's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.960 
okay but I'm not really sure if that's
gonna<00:03:24.370> matter<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.060> too<00:03:25.240> much<00:03:26.640> we'll<00:03:27.640> see<00:03:27.670> how

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
gonna matter to too much we'll see how

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.920 
gonna matter to too much we'll see how
it<00:03:28.120> works<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.690> mean<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:31.270> know<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.630> don't<00:03:31.750> live

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
forever so I don't really think there's

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.920 
forever so I don't really think there's
gonna<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.410> too<00:03:35.650> much<00:03:35.800> transfer<00:03:36.580> of<00:03:36.730> anything<00:03:37.330> I
