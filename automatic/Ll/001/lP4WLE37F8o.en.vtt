00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
because I felt like the makeup would

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.960 
because I felt like the makeup would
stick<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.750> my<00:04:13.870> hair<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:15.160> go<00:04:15.579> on<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.760> my

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.940 
stick to my hair and not go on to my
skin<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:16.660> would<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.900> had<00:04:17.380> somebody<00:04:17.620> tell<00:04:17.890> me

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
skin and it would I had somebody tell me

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.199 
skin and it would I had somebody tell me
in<00:04:18.099> high<00:04:18.190> school<00:04:18.459> one<00:04:18.609> time<00:04:18.640> that<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.060> should

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
in high school one time that I should

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.180 
in high school one time that I should
really<00:04:19.419> think<00:04:19.690> twice<00:04:19.870> about<00:04:20.049> using<00:04:20.349> face

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
really think twice about using face

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.379 
really think twice about using face
makeup<00:04:21.489> because<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.060> would

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
makeup because it would

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.330 
makeup because it would
accentuate<00:04:22.749> the<00:04:23.020> hair<00:04:23.199> on<00:04:23.319> my<00:04:23.349> face<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.039> I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
accentuate the hair on my face so I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.339 
accentuate the hair on my face so I
really<00:04:25.240> stopped<00:04:25.449> using<00:04:25.599> face<00:04:25.870> makeup<00:04:26.139> when<00:04:26.289> I

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
really stopped using face makeup when I

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.689 
really stopped using face makeup when I
was<00:04:26.439> about<00:04:26.530> 15<00:04:26.680> years<00:04:27.009> old<00:04:27.129> when<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.340> very
