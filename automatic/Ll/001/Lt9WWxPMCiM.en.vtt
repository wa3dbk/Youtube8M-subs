00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:07.849 
difficult to buy for unless you just buy

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.220 
difficult to buy for unless you just buy
gadgets<00:00:08.849> because<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:09.360> all<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.690> gadgets<00:00:10.110> so

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
gadgets because they all have gadgets so

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.839 
gadgets because they all have gadgets so
you've<00:00:10.349> got<00:00:10.530> iPod<00:00:11.150> iPad<00:00:12.200> Kindle<00:00:13.849> but

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
you've got iPod iPad Kindle but

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.420 
you've got iPod iPad Kindle but
everything's<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.870> expensive<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.310> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
everything's really expensive so if you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.750 
everything's really expensive so if you
don't<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> huge<00:00:18.330> budget<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.380> then<00:00:20.369> things

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
don't have a huge budget and then things

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
don't have a huge budget and then things
can<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.359> bit<00:00:21.480> more<00:00:21.720> difficult<00:00:22.109> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
can get a little bit more difficult so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.170 
can get a little bit more difficult so
I've<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.010> put<00:00:23.220> together<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.580> few<00:00:23.699> little

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.529 
I've just put together a few little
ideas<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.380> thought<00:00:25.740> well<00:00:25.920> quite<00:00:26.130> nice<00:00:26.539> if

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
ideas I thought well quite nice if

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.769 
ideas I thought well quite nice if
you're<00:00:27.779> stuck<00:00:28.490> for<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> get<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.390> dad's

or brother boyfriend or husband or son

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.160 
or brother boyfriend or husband or son
but<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:35.880> only<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.090> very<00:00:36.300> small<00:00:36.450> selection

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but there's only a very small selection

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.560 
but there's only a very small selection
of<00:00:37.410> things<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.670> gonna<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:38.910> quite<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
of things here so it's gonna be quite a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.400 
of things here so it's gonna be quite a
quick<00:00:40.050> video<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.629> first<00:00:42.629> thing<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.170> have

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.139 

which<00:00:46.410> i<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.910> indeed

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
which i think is very very good indeed

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
which i think is very very good indeed
and<00:00:48.390> I've<00:00:48.480> tried<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.230> works<00:00:49.469> it's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and I've tried this out it works it's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.229 
and I've tried this out it works it's
called<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.789> razor<00:00:50.969> pit<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> her

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
called the razor pit and it's like her

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.250 
called the razor pit and it's like her
it's<00:00:54.239> based<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
it's based on the same thing that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
it's based on the same thing that
barbers<00:00:55.770> used<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.370> sharpen<00:00:56.760> their<00:00:57.059> razors<00:00:57.420> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
barbers used to sharpen their razors on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
barbers used to sharpen their razors on
but<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> with<00:00:58.739> disposable

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but you actually use it with disposable

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.490 
but you actually use it with disposable
razors<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> extend<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.170> life<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
razors and it can extend the life of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
razors and it can extend the life of
each<00:01:01.620> disposable<00:01:02.430> razor<00:01:02.640> head<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.149> 150

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
each disposable razor head by about 150

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.219 
each disposable razor head by about 150
times<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> effect<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:06.720> could<00:01:06.930> use<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
times so in effect you could use the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
times so in effect you could use the
same<00:01:07.439> razor<00:01:08.159> head<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> whole<00:01:08.760> year<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
same razor head for the whole year and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
same razor head for the whole year and
you<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.810> drag<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> strip<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you just drag it down the strip and it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.420 
you just drag it down the strip and it
removes<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> dead<00:01:13.799> skin<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
removes all of the kind of dead skin and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
removes all of the kind of dead skin and
soap<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.600> dulls<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
soap and things like that that dulls the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.820 
soap and things like that that dulls the
blade<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
blade so I think this is really good and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
blade so I think this is really good and
it's<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> gadget<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:20.909> well<00:01:21.200> obviously

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it's kind of gadget in as well obviously

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.570 
it's kind of gadget in as well obviously
it's<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.979> present<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's not very good for a present for a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.710 
it's not very good for a present for a
guy<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> hasn't<00:01:24.689> started<00:01:24.990> shaving<00:01:25.380> yet<00:01:25.770> but

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
and I've been testing it out on my

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.440 
and I've been testing it out on my
guinea<00:05:33.330> pig<00:05:33.390> not<00:05:34.169> a<00:05:34.440> guinea<00:05:35.070> pig<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:36.090> human

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
guinea pig not a guinea pig the human

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.610 
guinea pig not a guinea pig the human
guinea<00:05:36.660> pig<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:39.030> really<00:05:39.330> does<00:05:39.570> work<00:05:39.600> so<00:05:40.590> I

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
guinea pig and it really does work so I

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.050 
guinea pig and it really does work so I
think<00:05:40.710> that's<00:05:40.979> quite<00:05:41.130> an<00:05:41.250> interesting<00:05:41.460> gift

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
think that's quite an interesting gift

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.100 
think that's quite an interesting gift
and<00:05:42.570> again

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
and again

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.380 
and again
it's<00:05:43.380> got<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.620> element<00:05:44.040> of<00:05:44.190> gadget<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.030> so

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
it's got the element of gadget to it so

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.950 
it's got the element of gadget to it so
men<00:05:46.110> would<00:05:46.290> probably<00:05:46.740> like<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.840> but<00:05:48.840> I'm

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
men would probably like it but I'm

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.630 
men would probably like it but I'm
actually<00:05:49.110> going<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.500> go<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:49.979> test<00:05:50.340> this<00:05:50.490> out

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
actually going to go and test this out

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.969 
actually going to go and test this out
now<00:05:52.400> slightly<00:05:53.479> concerned<00:05:54.479> about<00:05:54.840> it<00:05:55.110> but<00:05:55.470> I'm

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
now slightly concerned about it but I'm

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.770 
now slightly concerned about it but I'm
assured<00:05:56.490> that<00:05:56.790> after<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.240> first<00:05:57.479> five

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
assured that after the first five

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.690 
assured that after the first five
minutes<00:05:57.960> of<00:05:58.260> intense<00:05:58.650> burning<00:05:59.040> it's

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
minutes of intense burning it's

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.030 
minutes of intense burning it's
absolutely<00:06:00.390> fine<00:06:00.570> so<00:06:01.290> I<00:06:01.320> actually<00:06:01.650> think<00:06:01.919> that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
absolutely fine so I actually think that

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.610 
absolutely fine so I actually think that
this<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.430> some<00:06:02.700> is<00:06:03.330> good<00:06:03.600> to<00:06:03.810> present<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.500> not

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
this is some is good to present and not

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.240 
this is some is good to present and not
just<00:06:04.860> for<00:06:05.040> men<00:06:05.160> for<00:06:05.490> anybody<00:06:06.030> really<00:06:06.530> so<00:06:07.530> those

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
just for men for anybody really so those

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.780 
just for men for anybody really so those
are<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.550> couple<00:06:08.580> of<00:06:08.850> ideas<00:06:08.970> for<00:06:10.430> gifts<00:06:11.430> for<00:06:11.490> men

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790
