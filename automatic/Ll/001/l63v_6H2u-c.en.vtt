evenly<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.740> thermometer<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> placed<00:00:29.939> right

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
evenly the thermometer is placed right

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
evenly the thermometer is placed right
where<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> eggs<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.349> monitor<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
where the eggs are to monitor the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.250 
where the eggs are to monitor the
temperature<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.700> needs<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> kept<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.079> a

temperature it needs to be kept around a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.209 
temperature it needs to be kept around a
hundred<00:00:34.410> degrees

hundred degrees

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.090 
hundred degrees
keep<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> mind<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:37.230> body<00:00:37.260> temperature

keep in mind that your body temperature
is<00:00:38.129> around<00:00:38.399> 100<00:00:38.910> degrees<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.989> touch<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> eggs

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is around 100 degrees so touch the eggs

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010 
is around 100 degrees so touch the eggs
to<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> feel<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:42.120> sure<00:00:42.600> your

to see how they feel to make sure your

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889 
to see how they feel to make sure your
thermometer<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.829> working<00:00:44.280> correctly<00:00:44.899> we

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
thermometer is working correctly we

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.760 
thermometer is working correctly we
place<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> eggs<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.399> pillow

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
place the eggs on the pillow

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
place the eggs on the pillow
now<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.980> eggs<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.260> pencil

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
now these eggs have got in pencil

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.650 
now these eggs have got in pencil
they've<00:00:52.739> gotten<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.190> O<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.879> side<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> an<00:00:54.449> X

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
they've gotten an O on one side and an X

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.729 
they've gotten an O on one side and an X
on<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> other<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.770> help<00:00:55.980> us<00:00:56.420> determine<00:00:57.739> who's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
on the other to help us determine who's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.939

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so there's Eggbert and Shelley and Yocum

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
so there's Eggbert and Shelley and Yocum
if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.740> guys<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> seen<00:01:11.220> ice<00:01:11.400> age<00:01:11.640> 3<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> then

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
if you guys have seen ice age 3 and then

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.330 
if you guys have seen ice age 3 and then
we<00:01:13.170> cover<00:01:13.470> them<00:01:14.450> with<00:01:15.450> our<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.950> towel<00:01:16.950> here
