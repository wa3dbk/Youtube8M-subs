tried to make her speak that she is a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.540 
tried to make her speak that she is a
witch<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.690> that's<00:01:18.020> why<00:01:18.200> they've<00:01:18.500> done<00:01:18.620> so<00:01:19.370> many

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
witch so that's why they've done so many

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.850 
witch so that's why they've done so many
things<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:20.510> figure<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:21.440> are<00:01:21.470> learning

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
things to this figure we are learning

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.370 
things to this figure we are learning
how<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.040> do<00:01:22.280> our<00:01:22.520> own<00:01:22.790> prosthetic<00:01:23.240> species<00:01:23.960> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
how to do our own prosthetic species and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.240 
how to do our own prosthetic species and
so<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.370> think<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:27.650> course<00:01:27.860> is<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.010> very

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
so I think is the course is a very

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.370 
so I think is the course is a very
heavily<00:01:28.700> subsidized<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.420> lots<00:01:29.600> of<00:01:29.720> students

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
heavily subsidized so lots of students

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.649 
heavily subsidized so lots of students
haven't<00:01:30.650> paid<00:01:30.880> as<00:01:31.880> much<00:01:31.970> as<00:01:32.270> they<00:01:32.360> would<00:01:32.510> do<00:01:32.600> if

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
haven't paid as much as they would do if

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.670 
haven't paid as much as they would do if
they<00:01:32.780> went<00:01:32.900> into<00:01:33.049> probably<00:01:33.409> probably

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
they went into probably probably

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.170 
they went into probably probably
companies<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.400> do<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.880> would<00:01:34.940> cost

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
companies to do it it would cost

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.490 
companies to do it it would cost
thousands<00:01:35.690> for<00:01:35.840> them<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.049> do<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.260> elsewhere

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
thousands for them to do it elsewhere

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.330 
thousands for them to do it elsewhere
but<00:01:36.830> they're<00:01:37.010> very<00:01:37.220> lucky<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.670> have

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
