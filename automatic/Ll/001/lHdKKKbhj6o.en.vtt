00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
behaved quite well the best thing about

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.469 
behaved quite well the best thing about
the<00:05:55.440> DCI<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:56.100> this<00:05:56.340> car<00:05:56.610> is<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:57.060> is

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
the DCI in this car is that is

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.379 
the DCI in this car is that is
sufficient<00:05:58.139> power<00:05:58.380> at<00:05:58.650> all<00:05:58.949> gas<00:05:59.280> at<00:05:59.520> all<00:05:59.639> rpms

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
sufficient power at all gas at all rpms

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.210 
sufficient power at all gas at all rpms
now<00:06:00.690> this<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:00.990> big<00:06:01.260> car<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:01.650> in<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.860> city

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
now this is a big car so in the city

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.030 
now this is a big car so in the city
manoeuvring<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.330> is<00:06:03.780> very<00:06:04.110> simple<00:06:04.410> even<00:06:04.919> the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
manoeuvring it is very simple even the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.920 
manoeuvring it is very simple even the
second<00:06:05.370> gear<00:06:05.610> has<00:06:06.000> enough<00:06:06.479> torque<00:06:06.750> to

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
second gear has enough torque to

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.379 
second gear has enough torque to
actually<00:06:07.860> pull<00:06:08.070> you<00:06:08.160> through<00:06:08.220> traffic<00:06:08.850> that

is a good thing you don't have to take a
downshift<00:06:11.240> unnecessarily<00:06:12.240> and<00:06:12.419> again<00:06:12.840> and

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
downshift unnecessarily and again and

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.420 
downshift unnecessarily and again and
again<00:06:13.229> which<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.650> delight<00:06:14.070> when<00:06:14.310> you're

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.540 
so if Nissan manages to keep the price
around<00:08:02.810> 9.50<00:08:03.810> lakh<00:08:04.050> it<00:08:04.440> might<00:08:04.800> work<00:08:05.069> well<00:08:05.310> for

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:05.550 
around 9.50 lakh it might work well for

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.669 
around 9.50 lakh it might work well for
