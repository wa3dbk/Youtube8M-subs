shoe sizes that we have
so<00:00:45.780> starting<00:00:46.350> all<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
so starting all this all the way from a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.660 
so starting all this all the way from a
small<00:00:48.270> infant<00:00:48.780> size<00:00:48.960> ball<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.520> to

small infant size ball all the way up to

small infant size ball all the way up to
a<00:00:50.700> large<00:00:50.969> size<00:00:51.239> seven<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.559> many

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a large size seven and how many

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.970 
a large size seven and how many
millimeters<00:00:53.219> each<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.239> those<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.680> terms

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
millimeters each of those are in terms

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
millimeters each of those are in terms
of<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.280> length<00:00:56.520> I've<00:00:57.480> haven't<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:58.050> able<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
of what length I've haven't been able to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.959 
of what length I've haven't been able to
do<00:00:58.440> anything<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.010> terms<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.399> width<00:00:59.579> because

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
do anything in terms of width because

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.240 
do anything in terms of width because
that<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.390> such<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> hard<00:01:01.260> area<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.859> cover

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that is just such a hard area to cover

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.770 
that is just such a hard area to cover
because<00:01:02.789> obviously<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.300> shoes<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
because obviously the shoes not just

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.500 
because obviously the shoes not just
were<00:01:04.080> eyes<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.589> deep<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.700> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
were eyes it's deep things like that but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
were eyes it's deep things like that but
obviously<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.320> something<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
obviously that's something that you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.969 
obviously that's something that you
probably<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:09.060> having<00:01:09.479> been<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.659> mother

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
probably know having been a mother

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
probably know having been a mother
getting<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.189> child<00:01:11.460> measured<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> past<00:01:12.210> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
getting a child measured in the past so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510 
getting a child measured in the past so
if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.130> child's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
if you know that your child's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609 
if you know that your child's
particularly<00:01:14.939> deep<00:01:15.150> particularly<00:01:15.659> wise<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
particularly deep particularly wise then

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
particularly deep particularly wise then
we<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.189> able<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> recommend<00:01:17.670> certain<00:01:18.150> size

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
we all be able to recommend certain size

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.749 
we all be able to recommend certain size
for<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> day<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:20.189> five<00:01:20.369> foot

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
for that like for a day for five foot

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
for that like for a day for five foot
show<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.509> particularly<00:01:21.810> narrow<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.890> may

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
show that's particularly narrow that may

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
show that's particularly narrow that may
be<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.400> better<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.820> something<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.450> super

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
be much better for something like super

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.370 
be much better for something like super
fit

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

but<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.189> ways<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.759> around

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
but there are other ways of going around

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
but there are other ways of going around
that<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> use<00:01:28.619> Ella<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.310> know

because<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.670> maybe<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.940> start<00:02:15.210> leaning

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
because there maybe you start leaning

because there maybe you start leaning
forward<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.590> sprays<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.310> force<00:02:17.520> out<00:02:17.610> slightly

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
forward it sprays the force out slightly

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060 
forward it sprays the force out slightly
and<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.600> affect<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.350> measurement<00:02:19.860> that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
and it will affect the measurement that

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
and it will affect the measurement that
you<00:02:20.130> saved<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:23.460> then<00:02:23.670> need<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> make<00:02:24.270> sure

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
you saved you then need to make sure

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.250 
you saved you then need to make sure
that<00:02:25.140> you've<00:02:25.350> measure<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.190> longest<00:02:26.760> toe<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that you've measure the longest toe that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.050 
that you've measure the longest toe that
doesn't<00:02:28.530> necessarily<00:02:28.680> mean<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.880> going

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
doesn't necessarily mean that it's going

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.640 
doesn't necessarily mean that it's going
to<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> big<00:02:30.540> toe<00:02:30.780> all<00:02:31.080> depends<00:02:31.440> on

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to be the big toe all depends on

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.920 
to be the big toe all depends on
different<00:02:31.830> foot<00:02:32.190> shapes<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:33.330> also<00:02:33.570> need<00:02:33.900> to

different foot shapes you also need to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
different foot shapes you also need to
make<00:02:34.230> sure<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.800> foot<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.490> completely

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
make sure that the foot is completely

make a slight mark there and make a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880 
make a slight mark there and make a
slight<00:02:55.590> foot<00:02:55.950> mark<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.300> foot<00:02:57.540> there<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
slight foot mark on that foot there so

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.550 
slight foot mark on that foot there so

you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.030> move<00:03:06.150> away<00:03:06.270> now<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.650> where<00:03:07.800> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you can move away now this is where you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.840 
you can move away now this is where you
don't<00:03:08.100> need<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.460> get<00:03:10.310> tape<00:03:11.310> measure<00:03:11.550> and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
don't need to get tape measure and

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.020 
don't need to get tape measure and
you're<00:03:12.240> measuring<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.870> way<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.880> use<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
you're measuring all the way just use a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.150 
you're measuring all the way just use a
ruler<00:03:18.420> or<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> tape<00:03:18.660> measure<00:03:19.050> anything<00:03:19.920> you've

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
ruler or a tape measure anything you've

ruler or a tape measure anything you've
got<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.370> hand<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:23.280> will<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.700> trick<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.230> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
got to hand it will do the trick so that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.640 
got to hand it will do the trick so that
one<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.760> see<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.210> coming<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:29.330> but

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
one that you can see is coming out but

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.960 
one that you can see is coming out but
205<00:03:31.700> millimeters<00:03:34.010> that's<00:03:35.010> her<00:03:35.160> left<00:03:35.340> foot<00:03:35.610> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
205 millimeters that's her left foot and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:45.130 
205 millimeters that's her left foot and
her<00:03:36.660> right<00:03:36.930> foot<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:40.260> coming<00:03:40.800> out<00:03:41.040> at<00:03:42.650> 203

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
her right foot is coming out at 203

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.210 
her right foot is coming out at 203
millimeters<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.060> Bourbon<00:03:48.480> back<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
millimeters so the Bourbon back to the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.449 
millimeters so the Bourbon back to the
chart<00:03:50.490> we<00:03:50.730> have<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:53.750> only<00:03:54.750> you've<00:03:54.870> grown<00:03:55.459> if

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
chart we have here only you've grown if

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.010 
chart we have here only you've grown if
you<00:03:57.030> look<00:03:57.270> at<00:03:57.540> 200<00:03:58.170> millimeters<00:03:59.420> that<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.720> size

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
you look at 200 millimeters that is size

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.040 
you look at 200 millimeters that is size
one<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> fact<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.390> one<00:04:03.690> foot<00:04:03.930> is

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
one so the fact that one foot is

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.050 
one so the fact that one foot is
measuring<00:04:05.900> 205<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.500> other<00:04:07.650> 203<00:04:08.400> she's<00:04:08.790> more

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
measuring 205 the other 203 she's more

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.010 
measuring 205 the other 203 she's more
like<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.480> one<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.930> half

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
like a one and a half

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.990 
like a one and a half
having<00:04:13.020> said<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.290> she<00:04:13.740> is<00:04:13.920> narrow<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.820> we

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
having said that she is narrow so we

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.150 
having said that she is narrow so we
will<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.270> wanting<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.140> order<00:04:16.320> shoes<00:04:16.890> that

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
will be wanting to order shoes that

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.940 
will be wanting to order shoes that
around<00:04:17.520> a<00:04:17.670> one<00:04:17.940> two<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.479> one<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.870> half

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
around a one two a one and a half

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.050 
around a one two a one and a half
