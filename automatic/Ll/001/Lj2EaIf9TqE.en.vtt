00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's open The Nose! 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
This is very rare document.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.033
opening hinge cover

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200
By only one HEX ratchet.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.533
Hinge cover was released.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.333
now, they start opening the nose cover

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
rocked by only 2 bolts.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
It's too heavy.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Now, the hidden core, the coupler is appearing !

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.633
pulling locking pin

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
OK.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
Pulley and rope are needed.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:29.567
Coupler was set on standart position.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.770
Can you find the transpalency ?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.930
You can see the vertical headlights through a glass.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.530
So the nose was lighted dimmer.
