00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
drive is standard but I've seen the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.710

Tokyo Drift movie it's converted to rear
wheel<00:01:24.900> drive<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.470> perform<00:01:25.860> those<00:01:26.070> crazy<00:01:26.460> skids

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
wheel drive to perform those crazy skids

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.100

so<00:01:27.210> we'll<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> rear-wheel<00:01:28.080> drive

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so we'll go with a rear-wheel drive

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.289 
so we'll go with a rear-wheel drive
conversion<00:01:28.920> in-game<00:01:29.250> which<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.210> actually

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
conversion in-game which I actually

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
conversion in-game which I actually
thought<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.869> ruin<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.259> cars<00:01:31.530> performance

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159

but<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.670> turns<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> handle<00:01:33.600> really

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
but actually turns out to handle really

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
but actually turns out to handle really
nicely<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.500> definitely<00:01:34.860> advise<00:01:35.159> giving

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
otherwise all that's left is the most

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130
