00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:11.269
 Hello, I want to tell you how eminem 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.730
 removable caps without removing the head 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.859
 cylinder block counted on the Internet 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 many options yes there are all sorts of guys 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.599
 stuffed the rope into the cylinder through 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.210
 hole with hiv and then exposed 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.199
 piston and top dead center valve 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.670
 pressed down but such and such nonsense to me 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.580
 it seemed I made such an adapter 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:44.130
 simple candles were made 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:47.670
 I took a candle and cut it off. 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 core pulled and pasted it here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.890
 such here on zamu fitting it from the pump 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.240
 It was probably pumping mattresses there 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.259
 all sorts but such a crap happened 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.619
 we put on a manual icon 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:11.719
 carpenter's pump so that later 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.450
 twisting she's not left there 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:21.109
 screw the trail baldor cylinder 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.109
 instead of a candle 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710
 we change to pumps 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.970
 now a couple 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.810
 a couple somewhere shows all seven 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.810
 sad 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 crackers pulled magnetite 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.610
 at the spring then 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.610
 udaltsova 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.150
 got the old oil scraper 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.150
 neatly 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.810
 we put pressure on valve 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:12.050
 valve keeps tight valve does not fall 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.050
 in the cylinder just a tree on the valve 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.220
 pursed up 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.320
 few . 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.280
 boil put in place 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.420
 This color will be more convenient and how 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.420
 hands to handle 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.380
 that's all that's the whole replacement for no 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.540
 no dead spots 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.680
 cylinder ropes all elementary 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:27.840
 simple on the fitting this took well half an hour 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.840
 somewhere thank you all for your attention chow
