 and nobody gave him the let's have a workshop called carpentier 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 we need in the legs 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.250
 zelaya can be several 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.179
 the Palestinians and mediums the issue 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.859
 we need insecure 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 the walls of brazil 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 we also have charcoal 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.950
 we have some tapes 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.910
 they need 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.420
 when anbar tian helps some adults to help them contribute 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.880
 to do this workshop 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.570
 we are going to integrate the avatar in which the cave paintings were 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.280
 then it's worth here we have one pound 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.730
 where you can see some examples in this book that among the museum of 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.810
 Californias an expedition that we have from here in the Tijuana cultural center 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.020
 We found some pictures of paintings that are found 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.160
 in the peninsula 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.840
 I am going to choose this one that is here to translate it into the leg 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.660
 the model sea land 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.660
 and also have our brushes ready 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.320
 if you have seen some rock paintings or some images and primitive 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200
 from somewhere else although it is not the peninsula of baja california also 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 can translate it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 was they can even draw other things about 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.950
 and the most interesting thing of all is that this type of material or account in 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.040
 any place there are already those who criticize the color coffee to get this 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.080
 color mix the color red and the color green if they have a very dark coffee 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.050
 we can put a little yellow to make it a little clearer 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.160
 ancient inhabitants when they made the cave paintings and used them 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.600
 blood used some flowers or little plants that is the cinema 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.430
 and they also used the coal that comes out another later on we go 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.310
 to use 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.810
 normally these ancient settlers when drawing and painting 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.600
 they were based on everything they saw, for example, animals whose scant fan 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.920
 for example, if he is one of those who believe that, in some occasions we will see 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.339
 some suns then there were other elements of nature 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.339
 now that people said the transit 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.399
 well I finished my rock painting my art in stone 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.059
 i the next match 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:35.269
 placing a wire the first stretch is expected is to cut a wire of eta 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.419
 intercity meters approximately a longer post 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.180
 It is important what 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.689
 we'll see the blackboards points 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.029
 with massively 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 so you do not see it once 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.439
 let's place the wire under the piece 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.439
 Let's talk a little 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 following the shape of the earth 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 in this regard to stop 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.329
 and what we're going to do now is do as some basic ways 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.300
 like a triangle maybe a circle 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.999
 in this way more out 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:19.439
 so we can stop some grave some letter a role this 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.620
 All this 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.069
 thus 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.989
 the stone with a painting that weighs that we make timbre lawn like this 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.279
 integrate can 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.029
 she will make us forget 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.169
 yes no prÃ©val 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.809
 cute something that makes you feel good because they must also have letters 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.379
 they do nothing this is one of the activities that you can find here 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.069
 dry remember that every weekend we have children's workshops to the 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.120
 one of the afternoon in snail garden 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.079
 so wait for them here do not feel pressured by the material 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.639
 I know it's important that they come with a lot of desire to work
