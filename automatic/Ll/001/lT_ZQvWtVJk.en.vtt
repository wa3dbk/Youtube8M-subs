asked which is the budget one so let's

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.520 
asked which is the budget one so let's
now<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.290> all<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:27.680> action<00:02:28.870> ok<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:29.930> let's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
now see them all in action ok so let's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.500 
now see them all in action ok so let's
see<00:02:30.740> how<00:02:30.770> effective<00:02:31.520> these<00:02:31.700> things<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.330> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
see how effective these things out and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.900 
see how effective these things out and
practice<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.590> first<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.280> our<00:02:34.550> budget

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
practice so first up we have our budget

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.550 
practice so first up we have our budget
one<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> bit<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.590> pound<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:38.440> see<00:02:39.440> how

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
one is it a bit to pound and see how

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
one is it a bit to pound and see how
effectively<00:02:40.100> out<00:02:40.250> on<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.520> screen<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.850> don't

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
effectively out on the screen I don't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.610 
effectively out on the screen I don't
have<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.270> screen<00:02:41.510> cover<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.990> anything<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.470> it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
have a screen cover that anything on it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.860 
have a screen cover that anything on it
so<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> Street<00:02:44.330> on<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.630> glass

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so this is that Street on in the glass

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.250 
so this is that Street on in the glass
and<00:02:45.260> I'll<00:02:46.070> use<00:02:46.370> proxy<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.090> which<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.900> drawing

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
and I'll use proxy it which is a drawing

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.350 
and I'll use proxy it which is a drawing
up<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:48.980> can<00:02:49.130> see<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.459> display<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.820> nosov

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360

whose<00:04:51.560> we've<00:04:51.740> got<00:04:51.949> back<00:04:52.099> pencil<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.639> your<00:04:52.669> hand

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
whose we've got back pencil in your hand

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.140 
whose we've got back pencil in your hand
and<00:04:53.800> make<00:04:54.800> their<00:04:54.979> back<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.370> chunky<00:04:55.789> for<00:04:55.969> some

and make their back to chunky for some
people<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:56.919> probably<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.099> biggest

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
people and probably the biggest

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.730 
people and probably the biggest
disadvantage<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.509> is<00:04:59.860> thus<00:05:00.860> we<00:05:01.330> cannot

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
disadvantage of it is thus we cannot

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.529 
disadvantage of it is thus we cannot
seal<00:05:03.740> that<00:05:04.460> runs<00:05:04.729> through<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.120> whole<00:05:05.300> pain

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
squatchy which is an ideal because your

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.469 
squatchy which is an ideal because your
finger<00:05:54.589> isn't<00:05:54.740> that<00:05:54.949> squad<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.370> need<00:05:56.180> about<00:05:56.330> a
