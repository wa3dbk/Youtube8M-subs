00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
to about 55 60 yards from him all I

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.180 
to about 55 60 yards from him all I
could<00:03:52.690> see<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.140> hair<00:03:53.350> lying<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.800> his<00:03:53.920> form

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
could see is the hair lying on his form

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.320 
could see is the hair lying on his form
and<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> windy<00:03:54.760> day<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.150> it's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
and on a windy day like this it's

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.699 
and on a windy day like this it's
actually<00:03:55.450> rather<00:03:55.720> good<00:03:55.900> because<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.440> hair<00:03:56.620> is

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
actually rather good because the hair is

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.100 
actually rather good because the hair is
hunkered<00:03:57.070> up<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.480> end<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.750> could<00:03:58.930> just

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
hunkered up and in the end I could just

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.949 
hunkered up and in the end I could just
pick<00:03:59.350> out<00:03:59.670> the<00:04:00.670> bum<00:04:00.880> end<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.390> eye<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.930> I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
pick out the bum end and the eye so I

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.020 
pick out the bum end and the eye so I
the<00:04:02.590> big<00:04:02.800> cross<00:04:03.040> wind<00:04:03.340> blowing<00:04:03.580> so<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.820> aimed

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the big cross wind blowing so I aimed

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.920 
the big cross wind blowing so I aimed
about<00:04:04.330> an<00:04:05.080> inch<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> half<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.520> left

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
about an inch and a half and to the left

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.680 
about an inch and a half and to the left
of<00:04:07.930> his<00:04:08.140> head<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:09.160> way<00:04:09.250> my<00:04:09.460> thinking<00:04:09.850> is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
of his head and the way my thinking is

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.030 
of his head and the way my thinking is
if<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.020> wind<00:04:11.200> doesn't<00:04:11.380> affect<00:04:11.800> it'll<00:04:11.950> either

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
if the wind doesn't affect it'll either

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.980 
if the wind doesn't affect it'll either
miss<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.490> or<00:04:12.610> kill<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.120> no<00:04:13.210> mild<00:04:13.510> appellate

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
miss it or kill it and no mild appellate

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.560 
miss it or kill it and no mild appellate
hit<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.680> hair<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.190> mean<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> freaky<00:04:16.390> thing

hit the the hair I mean the freaky thing

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.210 
hit the the hair I mean the freaky thing
is<00:04:16.690> about<00:04:16.930> an<00:04:17.110> airgun<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.590> there's<00:04:17.769> no<00:04:18.040> noise

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220
