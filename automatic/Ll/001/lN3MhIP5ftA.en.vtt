ok so today I got that ring key swimming
I<00:00:03.870> already<00:00:04.589> reviewed<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.250> spy<00:00:05.879> Jen<00:00:06.470> spittin

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
I already reviewed the spy Jen spittin

whatever<00:00:08.069> um<00:00:09.000> this<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> nice<00:00:09.750> case<00:00:10.050> really

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
whatever um this is a nice case really

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.070 
whatever um this is a nice case really
well<00:00:10.920> done<00:00:11.210> when<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.300> comes<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> ring<00:00:12.929> key

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
well done when it comes to the ring key

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.670 
well done when it comes to the ring key
though<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.780> lesser<00:00:15.780> quality<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.470> my

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
though it is of lesser quality in my

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040 
though it is of lesser quality in my
opinion<00:00:16.980> if<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.940> look<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> edges<00:00:18.510> here

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
opinion if you look at the edges here

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
opinion if you look at the edges here
even<00:00:19.560> though<00:00:19.710> these<00:00:19.920> edges<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.520> sharp<00:00:22.070> but

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
even though these edges are sharp but

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.759 
even though these edges are sharp but
they're<00:00:23.640> very<00:00:23.670> uniform<00:00:24.510> there<00:00:24.779> they're<00:00:25.470> clean

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
they're very uniform there they're clean

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.109 
they're very uniform there they're clean
I<00:00:26.039> mean<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.640> would<00:00:27.060> recommend<00:00:27.300> using<00:00:27.720> some

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
I mean I would recommend using some

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.160 
I mean I would recommend using some
sandpaper<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.449> make<00:00:30.630> them<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> little<00:00:31.019> more

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
sandpaper to make them a little more

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.850 
sandpaper to make them a little more
rounded<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.120> make<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> nicer<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
rounded and that should make it nicer it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.500 
rounded and that should make it nicer it
ranked<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.430> hand<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.630> comes

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
ranked you on the other hand it it comes

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.799 
ranked you on the other hand it it comes
jaggedy<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.660> could<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:41.690> where<00:00:42.690> they

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
jaggedy you could see the where they

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
jaggedy you could see the where they
broke<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> off<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.530> mold<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.930> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
broke it off the mold right there and it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.880 
broke it off the mold right there and it
is<00:00:46.050> even<00:00:46.739> sharper<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:49.230> other<00:00:49.350> part<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is even sharper the other part of it is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.600 
is even sharper the other part of it is
when<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:51.000> Nexus<00:00:51.620> 5<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.219> reason<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
when on my Nexus 5 and the reason it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
when on my Nexus 5 and the reason it's
not<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> Nexus<00:00:54.270> 5<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.140> tried<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
not on the Nexus 5 is because I tried to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
not on the Nexus 5 is because I tried to
remove<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> started<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.090> scratch<00:00:57.680> at

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
remove it and it started to scratch at

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.979 
remove it and it started to scratch at
the<00:00:58.829> sides<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.370> nexus<00:00:59.940> 5<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> had<00:01:00.480> actual

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
the sides of my nexus 5 I had actual

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.889 
the sides of my nexus 5 I had actual
white<00:01:01.469> streaks<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> corners<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> my

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
white streaks right on the corners of my

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.710 
white streaks right on the corners of my
nexus<00:01:04.350> 5<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:05.400> trying<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> remove<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.390> case

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
nexus 5 from trying to remove this case

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.090 
nexus 5 from trying to remove this case
so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.030> really<00:01:09.030> don't<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.650> show<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so I really don't want to show it in the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
so I really don't want to show it in the
case<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.570> off

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
case because I don't want to take it off

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
case because I don't want to take it off
and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.080> scratch<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> again<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:14.760> going

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and then scratch it again so I'm going

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.990 
and then scratch it again so I'm going
to<00:01:14.939> send<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> Amazon<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:17.000> it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to send this back to Amazon because it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
to send this back to Amazon because it's
definitely<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.400> guess<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.659> nice<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
definitely I guess not as nice also the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
definitely I guess not as nice also the
camera<00:01:23.460> caught<00:01:23.670> out<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.540> looks

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
camera caught out on that one this looks

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
camera caught out on that one this looks
nicer<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.560> opinion<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> rinky<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.860> little

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
nicer my opinion the rinky is a little

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.450 
nicer my opinion the rinky is a little
bit<00:01:32.430> swimmer<00:01:33.650> what's<00:01:34.650> nice<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.280> ring

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
bit swimmer what's nice about the ring

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
bit swimmer what's nice about the ring
keys<00:01:35.670> ides<00:01:36.530> follows<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:40.290> curve<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> Nexus

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.450 
keys ides follows the curve of the Nexus
5<00:01:42.259> where<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> has<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.280> bit

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
5 where is this one it has a little bit

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.890 
5 where is this one it has a little bit
of<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:46.020> bevel

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.730 

I<00:01:53.890> personally<00:01:54.890> kind<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:55.880> siding<00:01:56.300> with<00:01:56.480> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
I personally kind of siding with the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.530 
I personally kind of siding with the
despite<00:01:57.740> Jen<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.130> seems<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.610> little<00:01:58.820> better

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
despite Jen it seems a little better

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.320 
despite Jen it seems a little better
done<00:01:59.810> in<00:02:00.530> my<00:02:00.710> opinion<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.520> really<00:02:04.910> bugs

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
done in my opinion but that really bugs

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.109 
done in my opinion but that really bugs
me<00:02:05.450> right<00:02:05.720> there<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.260> guess<00:02:07.040> sandpaper<00:02:07.730> should

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
me right there I guess sandpaper should

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419 
me right there I guess sandpaper should
fix<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:08.960> that<00:02:09.140> way<00:02:09.320> all<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.399> way

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
fix it and it's that way all the way

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.930 
fix it and it's that way all the way
around<00:02:10.780> also<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:11.990> one<00:02:12.200> has<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:13.040> tether<00:02:13.640> loop

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
around also this one has a a tether loop

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.970 
around also this one has a a tether loop
so<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.690> could<00:02:14.840> put<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> little<00:02:15.410> tether<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so you could put a little tether in

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.850 
so you could put a little tether in
there<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:17.690> tie<00:02:17.930> down<00:02:18.110> your<00:02:18.140> phone<00:02:18.560> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
there so it tie down your phone to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.320 
there so it tie down your phone to
whatever<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.800> touches<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.910> thought<00:02:23.209> i'd

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
whatever and touches on but thought i'd

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.850 
whatever and touches on but thought i'd
give<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.540> little<00:02:23.750> bit<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.170> update<00:02:24.320> on<00:02:24.530> some

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
give a little bit of an update on some

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
give a little bit of an update on some
of<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.070> all<00:02:26.030> righty<00:02:26.150> bye
