am<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.720> top<00:02:54.960> part<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.290> arm<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.800> not<00:02:55.980> colored

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
am the top part of my arm is not colored

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.850 
am the top part of my arm is not colored
but<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> pulled<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:58.080> hoodie<00:02:58.290> good<00:02:58.560> enough

but I pulled down my hoodie good enough

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.560 
but I pulled down my hoodie good enough
so<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.190> doesn't<00:02:59.220> show<00:02:59.700> at<00:03:00.000> all<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
so it doesn't show at all so this is

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.480 
so it doesn't show at all so this is
practically<00:03:04.050> what's<00:03:04.350> consisted<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.280> it's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
of layering on it practically it it

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.070
