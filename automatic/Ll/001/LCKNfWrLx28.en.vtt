mmm<00:05:54.280> there<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.580> another<00:05:54.789> way<00:05:55.110> there<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.229> in

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
mmm there is another way there is in

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.709 
mmm there is another way there is in
fact<00:05:56.530> another<00:05:56.680> way<00:05:57.009> and<00:05:57.219> this<00:05:57.699> is<00:05:57.759> actually<00:05:58.389> a

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
fact another way and this is actually a

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.709 
fact another way and this is actually a
bit<00:05:59.340> you<00:06:00.340> don't<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.789> can't<00:06:01.030> go<00:06:01.150> as<00:06:01.330> further<00:06:01.569> as

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
bit you don't you can't go as further as

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.570 
bit you don't you can't go as further as
you<00:06:01.810> can<00:06:01.960> in<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.229> avoid<00:06:02.440> because<00:06:03.250> this<00:06:03.400> way

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
you can in the avoid because this way

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.839 
you can in the avoid because this way
you<00:06:03.639> will<00:06:04.389> get<00:06:04.750> blocked<00:06:04.960> in<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.259> wall<00:06:05.409> so<00:06:06.370> if<00:06:06.699> I

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
you will get blocked in the wall so if I

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.429 
you will get blocked in the wall so if I
just<00:06:07.979> find<00:06:08.979> the<00:06:09.099> bit<00:06:10.110> because<00:06:11.110> there<00:06:11.289> is<00:06:11.409> a

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
just find the bit because there is a

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:17.969 
just find the bit because there is a
there<00:06:11.830> is<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.979> bit<00:06:12.219> but<00:06:13.229> right<00:06:14.340> here<00:06:15.659> we<00:06:16.659> go<00:06:16.979> okay

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
there is a bit but right here we go okay

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.369 
there is a bit but right here we go okay
so<00:06:18.039> if<00:06:18.250> I<00:06:18.340> just<00:06:18.490> throw<00:06:18.669> them<00:06:18.759> out<00:06:18.819> there<00:06:19.379> right

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
so if I just throw them out there right

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:21.689 
so if I just throw them out there right
what<00:06:20.800> you<00:06:20.889> need<00:06:20.979> to<00:06:21.069> do<00:06:21.190> is<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.400> need<00:06:21.520> to<00:06:21.550> get
