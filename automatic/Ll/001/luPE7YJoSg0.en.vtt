to be showing you are only the tip of
the<00:00:15.580> iceberg<00:00:16.090> because<00:00:16.510> there's<00:00:16.720> so<00:00:17.199> much<00:00:17.529> more

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
the iceberg because there's so much more

the iceberg because there's so much more
that<00:00:18.070> you<00:00:18.130> can<00:00:18.369> do<00:00:18.580> including<00:00:19.589> working<00:00:20.589> with

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
that you can do including working with

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.249 
that you can do including working with
patterns<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.999> applying<00:00:22.329> patterns<00:00:22.929> and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.919 
overlays but let's just take a look at
some<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:26.999> simple<00:00:27.999> ways<00:00:28.239> that<00:00:28.269> you<00:00:28.749> can

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929

paper<00:00:43.539> texture<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.260> so<00:00:44.500> we're<00:00:44.710> going<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:44.890> take

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
paper texture to so we're going to take

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.669 
paper texture to so we're going to take
a<00:00:45.250> look<00:00:45.579> at<00:00:45.789> a<00:00:46.059> couple<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.600> ways<00:00:46.719> we<00:00:47.019> can<00:00:47.260> go

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
a look at a couple of ways we can go

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
notice that it's it's pretty strong so

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.580 
it and I don't like shine on watercolor
paper<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.330> that's<00:03:22.480> one<00:03:22.990> of<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.200> areas<00:03:23.560> that

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
paper so that's one of the areas that

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.950 
paper so that's one of the areas that
would<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.370> would<00:03:24.730> bring<00:03:25.420> all<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> way

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
would that I would bring all the way

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.800 
would that I would bring all the way
down<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.410> zero<00:03:26.650> percent<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:28.060> let's<00:03:28.300> go<00:03:28.480> ahead

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
down to zero percent so let's go ahead

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.780 
down to zero percent so let's go ahead
now<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.080> select<00:03:29.980> okay

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
now and select okay

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.750 
now and select okay
and<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:32.110> can<00:03:32.290> see<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.920> I'm<00:03:33.010> going<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.190> zoom<00:03:33.520> in

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and you can see and I'm going to zoom in

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.930 
and you can see and I'm going to zoom in
here<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.710> paper<00:03:35.950> texture<00:03:36.460> has<00:03:36.730> been

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
here that that paper texture has been

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.300 
here that that paper texture has been
applied<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.750> image<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.770> looks<00:03:38.980> pretty

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
applied to the image and it looks pretty

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.350 
applied to the image and it looks pretty
good<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:40.000> know<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.240> looks<00:03:40.510> pretty<00:03:40.630> realistic

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
good you know it looks pretty realistic

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.600 
good you know it looks pretty realistic
you<00:03:43.360> know<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.500> not<00:03:44.800> overly<00:03:45.340> overdone<00:03:46.270> and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you know it it's not overly overdone and
