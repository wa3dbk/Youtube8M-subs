 here it is or the trait it became more 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 clear interest in the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.160

 here is hdmi and you can see everything without 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.230
 no problem 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.360
 Um, I do not know any resolution that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.750
 it's here on this side we can see 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.780
 here any resolution we will see here 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.070
 screen resolution, you will see that the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.810
 problem had on the second 1366 by 1888 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:01.079
 I'll put in 1920 by 1080 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.079

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.500
 Come on, I'm going to do it. I took it out here. 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.500
 that I'm going to put the power over 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.489
 notebooks 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:49.080
 Let's maximize it. Let's play. Let's go. 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.170
 Try to play back here on the screen. 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.830
 Be cool too. 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.260
 and tv but it gets a little blurry not 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.070
 I told you leave any resolution 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.680
 what 's on the cable 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:12.510
 see the screen resolution I see 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:16.910
 here 1368 1368 try to play it here full hd 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.690
 to see if you catch fire ale where you see there 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
 he set fire to the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.920
 yet it seems that the staff 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 image gets even a little darker 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.940
 blurry 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.490
 You're seeing there with the camera is a 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.390
 little imperceptible're I will change 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:47.640
 new there one must be living a reflection 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:55.320
 committed hdmi and let's go there again 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:58.530
 Hi! For me, the image is clearer. 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.860
 clearer the image of the person 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.840
 see if you notice anything 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.210
 can perceive something for the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.880
 camcorder and the video that for me is 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.150
 clear that it is better to be left 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.970
 any resolution he's here 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:22.530
 1920 by 1080 p That's the same resolution 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:25.230
 full hd that holds the personal monitor 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.360
 then this video was to show that 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.180
 there is really a difference between the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.320
 sup car what is vg what is this 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.020

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.710
