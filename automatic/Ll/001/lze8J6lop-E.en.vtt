that the parents are facing at this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.270

point<00:01:16.650> huge<00:01:17.720> well<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.100> what

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
point huge well they really they what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
point huge well they really they what
they<00:01:20.460> were<00:01:20.520> told<00:01:20.759> initially<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> babies

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they were told initially that the babies

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
they were told initially that the babies
probably<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> brain<00:01:23.009> had<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.460> formed<00:01:23.939> enough

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
probably the brain had not formed enough

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.230 
probably the brain had not formed enough
for<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.840> breathe<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.040> their<00:01:26.250> own<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
for them to breathe on their own and the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
for them to breathe on their own and the
babies<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.920> three<00:01:29.430> won't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
babies and that was about three won't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
babies and that was about three won't
let<00:01:30.090> me<00:01:30.180> see<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.689> pro<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.320> four<00:01:31.530> or

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
let me see that was pro that four or

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
let me see that was pro that four or
five<00:01:31.770> weeks<00:01:32.009> ago<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.270> happens<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> babies

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
five weeks ago as it happens the babies

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.719 
five weeks ago as it happens the babies
are<00:01:34.560> breathing<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.130> their<00:01:35.280> own<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.579> they've

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
are breathing on their own so they've

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
are breathing on their own so they've
passed<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.240> hurdle<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.170> next<00:01:37.470> hurdle<00:01:37.650> is

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
passed that hurdle the next hurdle is

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
passed that hurdle the next hurdle is
for<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.520> able<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> feed<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> be

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
for them to be able to feed and to be

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
for them to be able to feed and to be
able<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> feed<00:01:41.189> independently<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> the

able to feed independently and and the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
able to feed independently and and the
problem<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.799> two<00:01:44.490> mouths<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
problem is that they have two mouths two

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.499 
problem is that they have two mouths two
noses<00:01:45.630> two<00:01:46.290> brains<00:01:46.610> one<00:01:47.610> set<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> lungs<00:01:48.149> one

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
noses two brains one set of lungs one

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319 
noses two brains one set of lungs one
heart<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.869> stomach<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.210> if

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
heart one stomach and you know that if

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
heart one stomach and you know that if
you<00:01:51.450> breathe<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> same<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.649> you're
