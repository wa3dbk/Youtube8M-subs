the British Museum and so he

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.499 
the British Museum and so he
reconstructed<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.460> thought<00:01:50.759> Piltdown

reconstructed what he thought Piltdown

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330

man<00:01:51.750> would<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.020> looked<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.439> based<00:01:53.100> on

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
man would have looked like based on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
man would have looked like based on
these<00:01:53.670> fossils<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.409> showed<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
these fossils but when they showed it to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
these fossils but when they showed it to
the<00:01:56.159> scientists<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.689> under<00:01:58.020> glass<00:01:58.259> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the scientists it was under glass so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.319 
the scientists it was under glass so
they<00:01:58.680> could<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> examined<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.759> properly

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
they could have examined it properly

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.289 
they could have examined it properly
well<00:02:01.110> remember<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.280> thought<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.030> was

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
well remember that they thought this was

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
well remember that they thought this was
the<00:02:03.329> only<00:02:03.560> available<00:02:04.560> specimen<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> missing

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
link it was too precious to risk further

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
evolution is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.970 
evolution is
well<00:04:18.160> they<00:04:18.549> lie<00:04:18.780> yeah<00:04:19.780> they<00:04:20.140> do<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.590> as<00:04:20.920> a

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
well they lie yeah they do that as a

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.610 
well they lie yeah they do that as a
result<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:22.030> Piltdown<00:04:22.600> man<00:04:22.840> bones<00:04:23.140> weren't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
result the Piltdown man bones weren't

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.480 
result the Piltdown man bones weren't
even<00:04:23.950> displayed<00:04:24.430> for<00:04:24.940> decades<00:04:25.420> then<00:04:26.140> in<00:04:26.500> 1953

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
even displayed for decades then in 1953

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.940 
even displayed for decades then in 1953
the<00:04:27.820> British<00:04:28.180> Museum<00:04:28.470> finally<00:04:29.470> let<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
the British Museum finally let the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.850 
the British Museum finally let the
scientists<00:04:30.640> examine<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> fossil<00:04:31.870> they<00:04:32.650> had<00:04:32.830> a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
scientists examine the fossil they had a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.550 
scientists examine the fossil they had a
new<00:04:33.130> test<00:04:33.430> called<00:04:33.760> fluorine<00:04:34.330> dating<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:34.930> they

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
new test called fluorine dating and they

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.930 
new test called fluorine dating and they
tried<00:04:35.890> on<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.220> because<00:04:36.430> they<00:04:36.580> wanted<00:04:36.850> to

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
tried on it because they wanted to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.390 
tried on it because they wanted to
verify<00:04:37.150> how<00:04:37.570> old<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.960> was<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.380> way<00:04:38.950> Florian

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
verify how old it was the way Florian

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.220 
verify how old it was the way Florian
dating<00:04:39.700> works<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.120> you<00:04:40.420> have<00:04:40.570> to<00:04:40.720> drill<00:04:40.930> into

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
dating works is you have to drill into

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.740 
dating works is you have to drill into
the<00:04:41.440> fossil<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.670> have<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:42.970> get<00:04:43.210> to

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
the fossil because you have to get to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.330 
the fossil because you have to get to
where<00:04:44.230> everything<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.010> hasn't<00:04:45.310> been

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
where everything is that hasn't been

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.730 
where everything is that hasn't been
contaminated<00:04:45.730> from<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.360> outside<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.110> then

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
contaminated from the outside and then

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.490 
contaminated from the outside and then
you<00:04:47.830> tested<00:04:48.190> for<00:04:48.340> fluorine<00:04:48.580> levels<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.990> they

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
you tested for fluorine levels so they

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.320 
you tested for fluorine levels so they
start<00:04:50.770> drilling<00:04:51.010> into<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> fossil<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:51.940> then

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
start drilling into the fossil and then

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.390 
start drilling into the fossil and then
they<00:04:52.480> start<00:04:52.750> saying<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.940> you<00:04:55.330> smell<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:56.400> that

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
they start saying do you smell that that

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.060 
they start saying do you smell that that
smells<00:04:57.670> kind<00:04:57.940> of<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.060> burning<00:04:58.540> flesh

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
smells kind of like burning flesh

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.700 
smells kind of like burning flesh
something<00:05:00.070> organic<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.880> burning<00:05:01.710> there's

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
something organic is burning there's

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.040 
something organic is burning there's
nothing<00:05:02.830> organic<00:05:03.220> in<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> fossil<00:05:04.060> it

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
nothing organic in the fossil it

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.260 
nothing organic in the fossil it
couldn't<00:05:05.440> be<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.620> fossil<00:05:06.190> but<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.000> smells

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
couldn't be the fossil but it smells

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.990 
couldn't be the fossil but it smells
like<00:05:07.390> burning<00:05:07.750> flesh<00:05:08.140> well<00:05:09.040> you'd<00:05:09.460> think<00:05:09.490> they

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
like burning flesh well you'd think they

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.760 
like burning flesh well you'd think they
would<00:05:10.180> have<00:05:10.330> noticed<00:05:10.720> his<00:05:10.960> fate<00:05:11.200> been<00:05:11.500> set<00:05:11.740> on

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
would have noticed his fate been set on

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.270 
would have noticed his fate been set on
fire<00:05:12.390> one<00:05:13.390> would<00:05:13.570> think<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.500> they<00:05:15.040> looked

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
fire one would think so they looked

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.860 
fire one would think so they looked
inside<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.820> part<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.180> fossil<00:05:16.540> where<00:05:16.720> they

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
inside the part of the fossil where they

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.840 
inside the part of the fossil where they
drilled<00:05:17.230> what<00:05:17.860> they<00:05:18.040> found<00:05:18.280> is<00:05:18.550> that<00:05:18.580> the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
drilled what they found is that the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.390 
drilled what they found is that the
inside<00:05:19.510> of<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.810> fossil<00:05:20.260> was<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:20.680> light<00:05:21.040> gray

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
inside of the fossil was a light gray

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.300 
inside of the fossil was a light gray
color<00:05:21.450> just<00:05:22.450> like<00:05:22.750> bone<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.350> not<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.770> darker

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
color just like bone and not a darker

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.580 
color just like bone and not a darker
color<00:05:24.490> like<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.030> outside<00:05:25.450> of<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.660> fossil<00:05:26.080> but

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
color like the outside of the fossil but

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.920 
color like the outside of the fossil but
a<00:05:26.620> fossil<00:05:27.190> should<00:05:27.640> be<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.030> same<00:05:28.270> color<00:05:28.630> all

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
a fossil should be the same color all

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.020 
a fossil should be the same color all
the<00:05:28.960> way<00:05:29.140> through<00:05:29.530> since<00:05:30.070> it's<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.580> minerals

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
the way through since it's the minerals

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.300 
the way through since it's the minerals
that<00:05:31.419> replaced<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.050> phone<00:05:32.350> that<00:05:32.890> give<00:05:33.160> the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
that replaced the phone that give the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.940 
that replaced the phone that give the
fossil<00:05:33.790> its<00:05:33.940> color<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.290> meant<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.650> this

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
fossil its color so that meant that this

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.909 
fossil its color so that meant that this
was<00:05:36.220> not<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.490> fossil<00:05:37.030> at<00:05:37.180> all<00:05:37.330> but<00:05:37.900> all<00:05:38.200> that<00:05:38.740> had

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
was not a fossil at all but all that had

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.430 
was not a fossil at all but all that had
been<00:05:39.160> stained<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.640> look<00:05:39.850> like<00:05:40.120> one<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:41.290> they

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
been stained to look like one so they

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.650 
been stained to look like one so they
did<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.860> fluorine<00:05:42.310> test<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.820> they<00:05:43.180> found<00:05:43.450> out

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
did the fluorine test and they found out

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.540 
did the fluorine test and they found out
that<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.020> bones<00:05:44.230> were<00:05:44.500> hundreds<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.370> years

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
that the bones were hundreds of years

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.050 
that the bones were hundreds of years
old<00:05:45.880> not<00:05:46.390> millions<00:05:46.990> or<00:05:47.200> even<00:05:47.260> thousands<00:05:48.250> they

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
old not millions or even thousands they

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.450 
old not millions or even thousands they
also<00:05:49.270> examined<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.080> under<00:05:50.230> magnification<00:05:50.710> and

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
also examined it under magnification and

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.580 
also examined it under magnification and
they<00:05:51.820> found<00:05:52.090> out<00:05:52.360> that<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.810> teeth<00:05:53.110> were

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
they found out that the teeth were

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.680 
they found out that the teeth were
chimpanzee<00:05:54.550> teeth<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.270> had<00:05:55.419> just<00:05:55.450> been

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
chimpanzee teeth that had just been

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.230 
chimpanzee teeth that had just been
filed<00:05:56.200> down<00:05:56.530> to<00:05:56.950> look<00:05:57.100> like<00:05:57.310> human<00:05:57.669> teeth<00:05:57.850> they

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
filed down to look like human teeth they

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.659 
filed down to look like human teeth they
can<00:05:58.270> see<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.780> file<00:05:59.050> marks<00:05:59.560> now<00:06:00.070> if<00:06:00.250> they<00:06:00.520> had

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
can see the file marks now if they had

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.550 
can see the file marks now if they had
been<00:06:00.730> allowed<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.450> get<00:06:01.690> their<00:06:01.870> hands<00:06:02.169> on<00:06:02.380> this

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
been allowed to get their hands on this

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.890 
been allowed to get their hands on this
fossil<00:06:03.070> in<00:06:03.220> 1912<00:06:03.940> they<00:06:04.419> could<00:06:04.630> have<00:06:04.720> found

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
fossil in 1912 they could have found

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.650 
fossil in 1912 they could have found
this<00:06:05.080> out<00:06:05.320> in<00:06:05.530> 10<00:06:05.919> minutes<00:06:06.370> even<00:06:07.120> without<00:06:07.240> the

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
this out in 10 minutes even without the

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.740 
this out in 10 minutes even without the
fluorine<00:06:08.050> test<00:06:08.380> so<00:06:09.340> you<00:06:09.730> really<00:06:09.940> couldn't<00:06:10.480> say

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
fluorine test so you really couldn't say

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.740 
fluorine test so you really couldn't say
that<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.169> scientists<00:06:12.100> or<00:06:12.460> full<00:06:12.880> by<00:06:13.120> anything

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
that the scientists or full by anything

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.810 
that the scientists or full by anything
because<00:06:14.290> they<00:06:14.620> weren't<00:06:14.800> even<00:06:15.250> able<00:06:15.400> to

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
because they weren't even able to

because they weren't even able to
examine<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.480> properly<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.740> then<00:06:18.669> there's

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
examine it properly and then there's

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.430 
examine it properly and then there's
those<00:06:19.000> other<00:06:19.270> scientists<00:06:19.870> I<00:06:19.960> mentioned<00:06:20.350> who

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440

American accent why I like it I think it

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.170 
American accent why I like it I think it

the fossil until nineteen fifty three
many<00:06:49.680> were<00:06:49.890> suspicious<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.640> whole<00:06:50.850> time<00:06:51.150> and

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
many were suspicious the whole time and
