00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
board and of course I popped some extra

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.569 
board and of course I popped some extra
stone<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.079> don't<00:03:24.260> really<00:03:24.440> need<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.100> I'm<00:03:25.370> just

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
stone I don't really need it so I'm just

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.780 
stone I don't really need it so I'm just
going<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.910> cut<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.569> away<00:03:26.870> just<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:28.190> can

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
going to cut that away just so I can

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.090

leave enough to tuck underneath and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.270 
leave enough to tuck underneath and
again<00:03:32.470> remember<00:03:33.470> when<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:33.769> did<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.100> back

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.390 
again remember when we did the back
where<00:03:34.970> we<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.480> mitered<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.470> little<00:03:36.739> bit<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.250> we

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
where we just mitered a little bit so we

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.660 
where we just mitered a little bit so we
could<00:03:37.609> get<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.819> nice<00:03:38.180> tight<00:03:39.109> secure<00:03:39.620> fit<00:03:40.040> all

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
applies and again at the sides we just

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.500 
applies and again at the sides we just
go<00:03:45.889> around<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.400> tuck<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.790> underneath<00:03:47.090> now

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510
