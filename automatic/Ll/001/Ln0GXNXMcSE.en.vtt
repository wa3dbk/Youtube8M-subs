00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.700
 ah 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 a few days ago the newspaper silver the newspaper 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.770
 of Russia published a news according to the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.059
 which Peru is about to buy armored 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.430
 and combat vehicles to Russia by 700 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.430
 million dollars of forgiveness of dollars 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.100
 and we do not know what kind of armored what 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.310
 type of equipment are those that are 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 buy it is also known that there is interest and 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.610
 I do not know if it is already specified because 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.400
 now it is not public knowledge 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 except for the announcements of the minister of 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.970
 defense that are also being acquired 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 24 of control against that I do not have 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.190
 no objection because he found 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.230
 they do not really like that the armored 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.270
 and much less if it is about 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.090
 tanks I hope it's not about 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.970
 tanks but the helicopters yes and 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 besides the Russians the mi-17 and they are 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.180
 effectively the best helicopters 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.790
 for our reality but on the subject 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.620
 of the armored ones no one seems 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.020
 know what the conflict hypothesis is 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.140
 it is true that the military 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.050
 even before the failure of the already 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.500
 they had a little concern that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.510
 regarding the possible reaction of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 some military in chile that for those 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.430
 Chiles had armed tremendously good 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.100
 that has already happened and it is very clear that it is not going to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.930
 have a war hypothesis with 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.060
 none in our neighboring countries of 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.710
 way that the armored ones serve for very 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 little on the other hand there are many other 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.160
 needs within the forces 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.160
 which should be covered by 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.240
 At some point there may be conflicts 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.080
 what do I think that should be 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.180
 solved simply by pure 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.510
 of land that we read the gringos or 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.750
 be a little better I do not get with this 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.730
 because I can create bigger conflicts what 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.310
 which is called deterrence 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.129
 that 's why I think that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.500
 the armed forces and listen to your voices 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.159
 that they must disappear I think that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.640
 must remain something so that nobody 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.110
 not only the Chileans but none 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.950
 bolivia on some day then having 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.840
 money and try to force a way out 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.330
 our sea and us as we 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.640
 we would defend, I do not think it should be 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.079
 a defense like the one we did in the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.110
 pacific war that is a 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.450
 totally inefficient tom deficiency 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.910
 with ships that were not prepared 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.549
 with ships with votes that do not 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.230
 they had experience they did not have they did not know 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.410
 shoot 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.140
 so 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.110
 and ammunition that could not be mixed 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.900
 some like others had not 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 uniformized the calibers of the rifles 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.390
 really a disgrace and in the end 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.390
 we lost and we lost a lot
