 we discovered a very different zurbaran 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.729

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.959
 as for his son Juan the mastery of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.450
 line and concept of these works are at 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.780
 reach of very few and evidence the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.940
 modernity of zurbar치n 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.920
 the color and the monumentality of 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.350
 paintings are two of the aspects that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.080
 they make the visit to this exhibition something 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.510

 Spanish painting many times with funds 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 very dark in this case we have chosen 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.020
 a background I think very bright is a color 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.940
 that was used in the cloisters 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.590
 Sevillians but it is a color that we 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.440
 we can still see when we walk by 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.660

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.550
