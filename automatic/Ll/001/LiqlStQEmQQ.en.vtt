one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much
was<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> chemistry<00:01:22.409> between

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
was because of the chemistry between

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
the greatest things about these movies
where<00:01:25.979> people<00:01:26.009> switch<00:01:26.400> bodies<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.030> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
where people switch bodies like that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.359 
where people switch bodies like that
when<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> actor<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.170> able<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> perfectly

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
when the actor is able to perfectly

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.300 
when the actor is able to perfectly
embody<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.540> character<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.890> person<00:01:32.040> he

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
embody the character of the person he

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.149 
embody the character of the person he
switched<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.740> always<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
switched with that is always so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.710 
switched with that is always so
entertaining<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> watch<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.210> reminded<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.659> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
entertaining to watch it reminded me of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600

some of the issues I had with the phone
or<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.780> seemed<00:03:13.110> too<00:03:13.290> long<00:03:13.530> I'm<00:03:13.860> not

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
or that it seemed too long I'm not

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.040 
character didn't really seem to fit I
understand<00:03:35.489> why<00:03:35.880> he<00:03:36.239> needed<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.690> there<00:03:36.720> for

understand why he needed to be there for
the<00:03:37.110> story<00:03:37.440> but<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.250> seems<00:03:38.550> like<00:03:38.700> his

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the story but it seems like his

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.490 
the story but it seems like his
character<00:03:39.060> could<00:03:39.420> easily<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.959> been<00:03:39.989> deleted

from<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.739> film<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.820> film<00:03:41.850> wouldn't<00:03:42.239> have

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
from the film and the film wouldn't have

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.940
