00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
gentle thing you have to make sure he's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.720 
gentle thing you have to make sure he's
gentle<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.650> he's<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.130> trying<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> kill

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
gentle and he's not just trying to kill

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.400 
gentle and he's not just trying to kill
the<00:00:23.939> ball<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.420> he<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.869> took<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the ball you see how he just took it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.140 
the ball you see how he just took it
from<00:00:28.529> me<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.189> dropped<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:29.699> hand<00:00:30.000> now

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
from me and dropped it in my hand now

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
from me and dropped it in my hand now
when<00:00:30.420> she's<00:00:30.869> learning<00:00:31.170> something<00:00:31.410> new<00:00:31.560> he's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
when she's learning something new he's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.240 
when she's learning something new he's
super<00:00:32.489> heightened<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.750> he'll<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> eye

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
super heightened so he'll do the eye

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
super heightened so he'll do the eye
pinning<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> he's<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.210> excited<00:00:36.780> about<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
pinning and he's really excited about it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.869 
pinning and he's really excited about it
it's<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> bad<00:00:37.559> excitement<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it's not a bad excitement but it's

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.799 
it's not a bad excitement but it's
something<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.180> need<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.390> aware<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
something you need to be aware of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
something you need to be aware of
because<00:00:40.170> he'll<00:00:40.559> start<00:00:40.829> moving<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.219> fast

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
because he'll start moving really fast

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
because he'll start moving really fast
and<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.090> still<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> approach<00:00:43.170> him

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and you still need to approach him

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.670 
and you still need to approach him
slowly<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.960> excited<00:00:49.079> he<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
slowly so you can see how excited he is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.959 
slowly so you can see how excited he is
and<00:00:50.070> sometimes<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:50.730> lead<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and sometimes that will lead to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
and sometimes that will lead to
aggression<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.870> come<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> too<00:00:52.379> fast<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
aggression if you come in too fast and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.200 
aggression if you come in too fast and
start<00:00:53.100> trying<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> keep<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:54.090> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
start trying to keep up with them so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
start trying to keep up with them so
make<00:00:55.020> sure<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:56.160> movements

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
make sure that your know your movements

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.150 
make sure that your know your movements
continue<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.360> slow<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.829> how<00:00:59.010> much

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
continue to be slow you can see how much

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
continue to be slow you can see how much
more<00:00:59.399> willing<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> turn<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.780> because

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
more willing he is to turn here because

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.260 
more willing he is to turn here because
his<00:01:01.170> tail<00:01:01.379> doesn't<00:01:01.649> hit<00:01:01.890> anything<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.579> when

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
his tail doesn't hit anything and when

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.399 
his tail doesn't hit anything and when
you're<00:01:03.390> teaching<00:01:03.690> him<00:01:03.780> something<00:01:04.110> new<00:01:04.229> make

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you're teaching him something new make

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.880 
you're teaching him something new make
sure<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> cue<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.129> other<00:01:05.309> stuff<00:01:11.240> good<00:01:12.890> you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
sure to cue that other stuff good you

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
sure to cue that other stuff good you
don't<00:01:13.950> explain<00:01:14.220> why<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.700> shake<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
don't explain why I just shake what you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't explain why I just shake what you
did<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> reason<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.159> click<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> I'm

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
did and the reason that I click and I'm

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
did and the reason that I click and I'm
not<00:01:18.540> exactly<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> rewarding<00:01:20.130> him<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> because

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
not exactly the rewarding him is because

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
not exactly the rewarding him is because
he's<00:01:20.970> showing<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.600> excited<00:01:22.140> he<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
he's showing me how excited he is to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
he's showing me how excited he is to
Train<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Train so I know I can get more out of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
Train so I know I can get more out of
him<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> feed<00:01:27.180> him<00:01:27.420> less<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.320> just

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
him and have to feed him less and I just

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
him and have to feed him less and I just
to<00:01:31.799> add<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.250> she<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.610> saying<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.960> call

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to add on to what she was saying we call

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.399 
to add on to what she was saying we call
that<00:01:34.350> F<00:01:34.560> r1<00:01:34.979> f<00:01:35.310> r2<00:01:35.909> f<00:01:36.210> r3<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> means

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that F r1 f r2 f r3 and all that means

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710 
that F r1 f r2 f r3 and all that means
is<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> treat<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.670> given<00:01:39.000> every<00:01:39.210> first<00:01:39.450> time

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
is the treat just given every first time

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
is the treat just given every first time
every<00:01:40.079> second<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.799> every<00:01:40.950> third<00:01:41.159> time

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
every second time or every third time

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219 
every second time or every third time
that<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> bird<00:01:41.909> doesn't<00:01:42.119> trick<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> think

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that the bird doesn't trick so I think

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.999 
that the bird doesn't trick so I think
you<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.500> saw<00:01:43.740> her<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.009> half<00:01:44.130> r3<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.860> do

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
you just saw her do half r3 and you do

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.469 
you just saw her do half r3 and you do
that<00:01:47.159> after<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> bird<00:01:47.700> understands<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that after the bird understands the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.410 
that after the bird understands the
trick<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:49.409> spin<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> wave<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
trick like spin and the wave then you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
trick like spin and the wave then you
can<00:01:51.540> start<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.470> treating<00:01:52.920> every<00:01:53.100> single<00:01:53.399> time

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can start not treating every single time

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.160 
can start not treating every single time
where<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> beginning<00:01:54.720> where<00:01:55.079> he's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
where in the beginning where he's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
where in the beginning where he's
learning<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> trick<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> treat

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
learning a trick here you want to treat

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
learning a trick here you want to treat
every<00:01:57.240> single<00:01:57.630> time<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.899> he<00:01:58.170> does<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.469> right

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
every single time that he does it right

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.899 
every single time that he does it right
hopefully<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> makes<00:01:59.670> sense<00:01:59.899> all<00:02:00.899> right

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.480 

and<00:02:04.909> its<00:02:05.659> best<00:02:06.020> when<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.740> can<00:02:06.920> tell<00:02:07.159> me<00:02:07.340> you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and its best when you can tell me you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.400 
and its best when you can tell me you
can<00:02:07.520> set<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.119> his<00:02:08.390> environment<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.020> where<00:02:09.200> he

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
can set up his environment to where he

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.699 
can set up his environment to where he
can<00:02:09.619> fly<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.950> certain<00:02:10.459> places<00:02:10.780> um<00:02:11.810> because

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
can fly to certain places um because

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.920 
can fly to certain places um because
when<00:02:13.040> he's<00:02:13.250> pent<00:02:13.640> up<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.910> his<00:02:14.030> cage<00:02:14.300> all<00:02:14.450> day<00:02:14.480> he

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
when he's pent up in his cage all day he

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.230 
when he's pent up in his cage all day he
becomes<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.380> monster<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.760> let<00:02:16.940> him<00:02:17.120> out

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
becomes a monster when you let him out

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.270 
becomes a monster when you let him out
he<00:02:17.480> has<00:02:17.569> too<00:02:17.780> much<00:02:17.900> energy<00:02:17.959> if<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.010> could<00:02:19.160> ask

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
he has too much energy if you could ask

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.190 
he has too much energy if you could ask
him<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.670> these<00:02:19.790> short<00:02:20.090> flights<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.690> travel

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
him to do these short flights and travel

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.050 
him to do these short flights and travel
around<00:02:21.260> his<00:02:21.560> cage<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.010> stuff<00:02:22.280> he<00:02:22.610> will<00:02:22.760> become

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
around his cage and stuff he will become

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.750 
around his cage and stuff he will become
much<00:02:23.450> better<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.430> right<00:02:25.610> now
