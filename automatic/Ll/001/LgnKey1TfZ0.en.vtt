I've<00:01:36.990> even<00:01:37.380> seen<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.829> Costco<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.880> they're

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I've even seen them at Costco so they're

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
I've even seen them at Costco so they're
they're<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> easy<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> find<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
they're kind of easy to find there is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
they're kind of easy to find there is
also<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.060> large<00:01:42.479> window<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
also a large window right there as you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
also a large window right there as you
can<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.729> light<00:01:44.939> gets

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
can see but actually not much light gets

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
can see but actually not much light gets
in<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> direction<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
in there because of the direction of the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
in there because of the direction of the
Sun<00:01:46.710> plus<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.490> tall<00:01:47.670> building

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
Sun plus this really tall building

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
Sun plus this really tall building
across<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> blocks<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> light

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
across from me that blocks all the light

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
across from me that blocks all the light
so<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.430> doesn't<00:01:50.610> help<00:01:50.790> much<00:01:51.000> plus<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so it really doesn't help much plus I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.830 
so it really doesn't help much plus I
film<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.020> night<00:01:52.049> most<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.920> anyway<00:01:53.310> so

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
film at night most of the time anyway so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
film at night most of the time anyway so
doesn't<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:55.020> help<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.829> why<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> wanted

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
doesn't really help that's why I wanted

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.830 
doesn't really help that's why I wanted
some<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.729> good<00:01:56.850> lights<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.509> reason<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
some really good lights the reason you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.230 
some really good lights the reason you
need<00:01:57.960> good<00:01:58.350> lighting<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> helps<00:02:00.180> with

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
need good lighting is that it helps with

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.539 
need good lighting is that it helps with
your<00:02:00.450> video<00:02:00.689> quality<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.469> mean<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.280> my<00:02:02.369> art

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
your video quality I mean I want my art

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.359 
your video quality I mean I want my art
to<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:02.729> its<00:02:02.909> best<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.810> also

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
to look its best for one but also

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.889 
to look its best for one but also
cameras<00:02:05.369> work<00:02:05.579> best<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.119> brighter<00:02:06.390> light<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
cameras work best in brighter light and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.290 
cameras work best in brighter light and
if<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.259> dark<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:08.190> picture<00:02:08.580> quality<00:02:09.000> isn't

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
if it's dark your picture quality isn't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
if it's dark your picture quality isn't
going<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.690> good<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to be as good it's going to be

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.710 
going to be as good it's going to be
more<00:02:10.770> grainy<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.879> actually<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.420> brighten

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
more grainy and I actually do brighten

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
more grainy and I actually do brighten
my<00:02:12.930> video

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
my video

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
my video
is<00:02:13.319> when<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.560> edit<00:02:13.799> them<00:02:14.129> but<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.150> too

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is when I edit them but if you do too

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.199 
is when I edit them but if you do too
much<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.319> again<00:02:16.650> get<00:02:16.920> grainy<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
much of that it can again get grainy so

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.990 
much of that it can again get grainy so
I<00:02:18.769> kind<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.799> wanted<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.069> better<00:02:20.220> lighting<00:02:20.670> setup

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I kind of wanted a better lighting setup

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.940 
I kind of wanted a better lighting setup
to<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.480> film<00:02:21.750> better<00:02:21.959> video<00:02:22.349> quality<00:02:22.560> off

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
to just film better video quality off

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.649 
to just film better video quality off
the<00:02:23.129> start<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.090> less<00:02:24.299> editing

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
the start and have to do less editing

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.660 
the start and have to do less editing
don't<00:02:25.500> feel<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.010> need<00:02:26.189> to<00:02:26.220> get<00:02:26.430> this

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
don't feel like you need to get this

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.819 
don't feel like you need to get this
fancy<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.659> your<00:02:27.810> lights<00:02:28.019> but<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.709> try<00:02:28.799> to

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
fancy with your lights but just try to

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.589 
fancy with your lights but just try to
get<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.129> as<00:02:29.250> bright<00:02:29.459> as<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.360> best

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
get it as bright as you can for the best

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.259 
get it as bright as you can for the best
possible<00:02:30.900> picture<00:02:31.319> quality<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.159> then<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:33.150> my

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
possible picture quality and then for my

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.539 
possible picture quality and then for my
microphone<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.500> blue<00:02:34.829> Nessie<00:02:35.280> which

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
microphone I have this blue Nessie which

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.349 
microphone I have this blue Nessie which
I<00:02:35.730> got<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> Best<00:02:36.480> Buy<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.799> use<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.489> while<00:02:39.150> I'm

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
I got it Best Buy and I use it while I'm

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.059 
I got it Best Buy and I use it while I'm
recording<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:40.379> doing<00:02:40.620> something<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:40.950> a

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
recording if I'm doing something like a

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.130 
recording if I'm doing something like a
tutorial<00:02:41.430> otherwise<00:02:42.329> I<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:43.019> use

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
tutorial otherwise I actually don't use

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.750 
tutorial otherwise I actually don't use
it<00:02:43.379> while<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> record<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.189> I<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.459> use<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.730> for

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
it while I record and I just use it for

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
it while I record and I just use it for
voiceover<00:02:45.450> after<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.989> fact<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.400> really

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
voiceover after the fact but I do really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.020 
voiceover after the fact but I do really
like<00:02:47.879> it<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.409> my<00:02:49.739> tripod<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.579> my

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
like it so that I have my tripod and my

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.270 
like it so that I have my tripod and my
camera<00:02:51.599> I<00:02:51.840> actually<00:02:52.319> never<00:02:52.590> used<00:02:52.859> to<00:02:52.980> use<00:02:53.010> my

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
camera I actually never used to use my

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.430 
camera I actually never used to use my
tripod<00:02:53.639> in<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.909> past<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.750> figured<00:02:55.319> out<00:02:55.409> a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
tripod in the past but I figured out a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.160 
tripod in the past but I figured out a
cool<00:02:55.739> setup<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.030> feet<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> tripod<00:02:57.989> are

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
cool setup so the feet of the tripod are

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
cool setup so the feet of the tripod are
resting<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> windowsill<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.400> then<00:02:59.819> it's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
resting on the windowsill and then it's

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490 
resting on the windowsill and then it's
leaning<00:03:00.389> against<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> desk<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.260> kind<00:03:01.440> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
leaning against the desk it's kind of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.729 
leaning against the desk it's kind of
wedged<00:03:01.889> in<00:03:02.280> there<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.750> then<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.079> have<00:03:04.500> my

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
wedged in there and then I have my

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.920 
wedged in there and then I have my
camera<00:03:05.010> up<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.510> extended

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
camera up here and I have this extended

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.470 
camera up here and I have this extended
pretty<00:03:07.319> high<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.950> because<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.819> higher<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> go

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
pretty high just because the higher I go

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.660 
pretty high just because the higher I go
the<00:03:09.510> further<00:03:10.200> forward<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:10.980> comes<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.489> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the further forward it comes because I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.129 
the further forward it comes because I
don't<00:03:11.909> want<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> film<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.569> feet<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
don't want to film the feet of the

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.860 
don't want to film the feet of the
tripod<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:13.889> why<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.609> it<00:03:14.879> angled<00:03:15.480> like

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
tripod that's why I have it angled like

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.990 
tripod that's why I have it angled like
this<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.379> so<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:17.159> see<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.549> feet<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
this is so you don't see the feet of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.569 
this is so you don't see the feet of the
tripod<00:03:18.359> in<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> video<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.349> then<00:03:20.160> at<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> very

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
tripod in the video and then at the very

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.640 
tripod in the video and then at the very
top<00:03:20.790> here<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.419> camera<00:03:21.690> screws<00:03:22.199> in<00:03:22.440> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
top here the camera screws in and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.159 
top here the camera screws in and
there's<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.400> flap<00:03:23.819> right<00:03:24.120> here<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:24.989> see

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
there's this flap right here you can see

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.289 
there's this flap right here you can see
that<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.349> have<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.500> angled<00:03:26.010> upwards<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
that I have it angled upwards so the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.080 
that I have it angled upwards so the
camera<00:03:27.690> points<00:03:28.109> down<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.730> face

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
camera points down just so it can face

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.509 
camera points down just so it can face
downwards<00:03:30.569> at<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.109> drawing<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.680> when<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.400> do

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
downwards at the drawing and when you do

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.460 
downwards at the drawing and when you do
it<00:03:32.609> this<00:03:32.760> way<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:33.269> picture<00:03:33.660> will<00:03:33.900> actually<00:03:34.319> be

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it this way the picture will actually be

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.960 
it this way the picture will actually be
upside<00:03:34.859> down<00:03:35.069> when<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.310> edit<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> video

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
upside down when you edit the video

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.640 
upside down when you edit the video
because<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.449> screen<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.810> currently<00:03:37.290> upside

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
because the screen is currently upside

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.439 
because the screen is currently upside
down<00:03:37.799> I've<00:03:38.549> never<00:03:38.819> had<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.359> my

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
down I've never had to do that with my

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.849 
down I've never had to do that with my
old<00:03:39.660> set<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.019> but<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.349> actually<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.829> that

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
old set up but it's actually not that

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.740 
old set up but it's actually not that
hard<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.250> do<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.489> editing<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:41.940> all<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.389> it

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
hard to do in editing at all so it

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.089 
hard to do in editing at all so it
shouldn't<00:03:43.109> be<00:03:43.199> too<00:03:43.379> much<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.949> an

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
shouldn't be too much of an

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.150 
shouldn't be too much of an
inconvenience<00:03:45.049> this<00:03:46.049> tripod<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.889> don't<00:03:47.069> know

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.050 
little bit better this is the canon
powershot<00:04:02.220> g7x<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:04.290> i<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.340> got<00:04:05.549> it<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.909> it

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
powershot g7x and i just got it and it

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.629 
powershot g7x and i just got it and it
is<00:04:06.180> amazing<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.959> has<00:04:06.989> beautiful<00:04:07.799> picture

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
is amazing it has beautiful picture

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.939 
is amazing it has beautiful picture
quality<00:04:09.209> which<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.260> what<00:04:10.409> I'm<00:04:10.500> most<00:04:10.680> excited

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
quality which is what I'm most excited

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.099 
quality which is what I'm most excited
about<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.729> then<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.000> other<00:04:12.180> good<00:04:12.569> perk<00:04:12.840> about

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
about and then the other good perk about

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.649 
about and then the other good perk about
it<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.409> that<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.680> has<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:14.040> flip<00:04:14.370> up<00:04:14.489> screen<00:04:14.699> so

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
it is that it has this flip up screen so

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.449 
it is that it has this flip up screen so
it<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.959> fold<00:04:16.139> down<00:04:16.409> it<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.859> pull<00:04:17.099> all<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> way

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
it can fold down it can pull all the way

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.250 
it can fold down it can pull all the way
up<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.760> can<00:04:17.909> go<00:04:18.060> all<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.449> way<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.599> here<00:04:19.079> but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
up it can go all the way to here but

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.259 
up it can go all the way to here but
when<00:04:19.859> I'm<00:04:19.979> sitting<00:04:20.159> down<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.430> probably<00:04:20.849> wanted

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
when I'm sitting down I probably wanted

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.219 
when I'm sitting down I probably wanted
an<00:04:21.450> angle<00:04:21.900> about<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:24.360> lets<00:04:24.570> me<00:04:24.690> see

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
an angle about here and it lets me see

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.080 
an angle about here and it lets me see
the<00:04:25.380> artwork<00:04:25.650> while<00:04:26.370> I'm<00:04:26.520> working<00:04:26.849> so<00:04:26.969> I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
the artwork while I'm working so I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.300 
the artwork while I'm working so I
no<00:04:27.330> if<00:04:27.480> I'm<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.780> frame<00:04:28.050> or<00:04:28.260> not<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.710> mean<00:04:28.919> with<00:04:29.190> my

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
no if I'm in frame or not I mean with my

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.250 
no if I'm in frame or not I mean with my
old<00:04:29.460> set<00:04:29.669> up<00:04:29.820> my<00:04:30.210> camera<00:04:30.510> was<00:04:30.750> actually<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> lot

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
old set up my camera was actually a lot

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.439 
old set up my camera was actually a lot
lower<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.889> so<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.460> could<00:04:32.699> usually<00:04:32.940> just<00:04:33.120> poke

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
lower and so I could usually just poke

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.990 
lower and so I could usually just poke
my<00:04:33.660> head<00:04:33.690> up<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.110> see<00:04:34.290> if<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.800> frame<00:04:35.100> but

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
my head up and see if I was in frame but

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.360 
my head up and see if I was in frame but
with<00:04:36.600> this<00:04:36.810> setup<00:04:37.050> my<00:04:37.260> camera<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.680> much<00:04:38.040> higher

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
with this setup my camera is much higher

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.450 
with this setup my camera is much higher
and<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.360> I'm<00:04:39.780> really<00:04:40.410> dependent<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.310> this

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
and so I'm really dependent on this

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.969 
and so I'm really dependent on this
screen<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.389> see<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:42.930> I'm<00:04:43.020> actually<00:04:43.260> filming

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979
