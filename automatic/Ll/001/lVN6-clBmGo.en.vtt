00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.310 

so<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.120> idea<00:00:14.240> that<00:00:14.480> I<00:00:14.630> had<00:00:14.719> charted<00:00:15.080> out<00:00:15.170> in

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
so the idea that I had charted out in

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.109 
so the idea that I had charted out in
the<00:00:15.410> storyboard<00:00:15.889> for<00:00:15.920> this<00:00:16.160> next<00:00:16.430> shot<00:00:16.610> was<00:00:17.000> I

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
the storyboard for this next shot was I

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.810 
the storyboard for this next shot was I
wanted<00:00:17.330> to<00:00:17.450> look<00:00:17.570> at<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.750> blueprint<00:00:18.290> and<00:00:18.529> then

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
wanted to look at a blueprint and then

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.580 
wanted to look at a blueprint and then
descend<00:00:19.820> down<00:00:20.119> into<00:00:20.689> that<00:00:20.810> blueprint<00:00:21.349> and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
descend down into that blueprint and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.249 
descend down into that blueprint and
have<00:00:21.950> it<00:00:22.070> smoothly<00:00:22.400> transition<00:00:23.240> into<00:00:23.509> an

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
have it smoothly transition into an

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.760 
have it smoothly transition into an
actual<00:00:24.590> set<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:25.520> know<00:00:25.640> full<00:00:25.880> color<00:00:26.529> so<00:00:27.529> first

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
actual set you know full color so first

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.800 
actual set you know full color so first
of<00:00:27.890> all<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.009> constructed<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:28.880> primary<00:00:29.330> set<00:00:29.660> in

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
of all I constructed the primary set in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.470 
of all I constructed the primary set in
movie<00:00:30.289> storm<00:00:30.529> then<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.519> made<00:00:31.789> an<00:00:31.910> alternate

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
movie storm then I made an alternate

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.330 
movie storm then I made an alternate
version<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:33.019> that<00:00:33.050> same<00:00:33.440> set<00:00:33.800> by<00:00:33.980> making<00:00:34.280> a

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
version of that same set by making a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.009 
version of that same set by making a
copy<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.059> then<00:00:35.360> removing<00:00:35.690> certain

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
copy of it and then removing certain

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.049 
copy of it and then removing certain
elements<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.739> simplifying<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.850> color

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
elements and simplifying the color

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.360 
elements and simplifying the color
scheme<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.470> is<00:00:39.650> what<00:00:39.800> was<00:00:39.920> going<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.250> be

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
scheme and this is what was going to be

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.160 
scheme and this is what was going to be
run<00:00:40.550> through<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.090> filters<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.840> give<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.080> a

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
run through the filters to give it a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.799 
run through the filters to give it a
blueprint<00:00:42.739> look<00:00:43.269> now<00:00:44.269> I<00:00:44.300> went<00:00:44.540> ahead<00:00:44.660> and

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
blueprint look now I went ahead and

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.049 
blueprint look now I went ahead and
recorded<00:00:45.019> the<00:00:45.469> camera<00:00:45.980> movement<00:00:46.430> in<00:00:46.640> movie

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
recorded the camera movement in movie

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.940 
recorded the camera movement in movie
storm<00:00:47.360> with<00:00:47.600> both<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:48.050> those<00:00:48.170> sets<00:00:48.530> because

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
storm with both of those sets because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.470 
storm with both of those sets because
basically<00:00:49.309> we're<00:00:49.700> going<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:49.879> cross<00:00:50.120> fade

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
basically we're going to cross fade

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.450 
basically we're going to cross fade
between<00:00:50.660> them<00:00:51.110> once<00:00:51.410> we<00:00:51.530> finish<00:00:51.860> prepping<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
between them once we finish prepping the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.670 
between them once we finish prepping the
blueprint<00:00:52.820> version<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:53.899> grabbed<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.410> first

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
blueprint version so I grabbed the first

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040 
blueprint version so I grabbed the first
frame<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.820> blueprint<00:00:56.210> descent<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:56.660> open

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
frame of the blueprint descent and open

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.600 
frame of the blueprint descent and open
it<00:00:57.140> up<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.379> paintshop<00:00:57.680> pro<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.160> could<00:00:58.430> use

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
it up in paintshop pro you could use

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.430 
it up in paintshop pro you could use
your<00:00:58.850> image<00:00:59.059> editor<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.449> choice<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.930> applied

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
your image editor of choice I applied

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.900 
your image editor of choice I applied
some<00:01:00.469> filters<00:01:01.039> to<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.520> give<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:01.820> a

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
some filters to it to give it a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.270 
some filters to it to give it a
blueprint<00:01:02.449> type<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.840> look<00:01:02.960> saved<00:01:03.559> my<00:01:03.860> settings

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
blueprint type of look saved my settings

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.620 
blueprint type of look saved my settings
for<00:01:04.489> those<00:01:04.580> filters<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.300> could<00:01:05.360> later

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
for those filters so that I could later

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.540 
for those filters so that I could later
make<00:01:05.750> use<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.170> those<00:01:06.440> as<00:01:06.619> you'll<00:01:06.770> see<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.130> then

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
make use of those as you'll see and then

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.730 
make use of those as you'll see and then
for<00:01:07.789> the<00:01:07.880> opening<00:01:08.240> shot<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.720> added<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.289> new<00:01:09.470> layer

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
for the opening shot I added a new layer

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.249 
for the opening shot I added a new layer
to<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.130> image<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.700> added<00:01:11.270> some<00:01:11.300> overlays<00:01:11.930> to

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
to this image and added some overlays to

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.560 
to this image and added some overlays to
fill<00:01:12.590> out<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.160> blueprint<00:01:13.580> drawing<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.240> I

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
fill out the blueprint drawing and I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.359 
fill out the blueprint drawing and I
just<00:01:14.750> used<00:01:14.960> some<00:01:15.080> reference<00:01:15.680> photos<00:01:16.130> online

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
just used some reference photos online

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.820 
just used some reference photos online
to<00:01:17.000> get<00:01:17.179> some<00:01:17.360> ideas<00:01:17.780> for<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.440> kinds<00:01:18.770> of

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
to get some ideas for the kinds of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.800 
to get some ideas for the kinds of
elements<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.250> put<00:01:19.459> on<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:19.789> then<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.509> took<00:01:20.630> that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
elements to put on this then I took that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
elements to put on this then I took that
layer<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.530> overlays<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.399> put<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:22.640> over<00:01:22.910> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
layer of overlays and I put that over a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.190 
layer of overlays and I put that over a
green<00:01:23.270> background<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:23.959> i<00:01:23.990> could<00:01:24.050> easily

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
green background so that i could easily

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.190 
green background so that i could easily
chroma<00:01:24.679> that<00:01:24.920> end<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.310> post<00:01:25.819> now<00:01:26.780> we<00:01:26.840> got<00:01:27.110> to

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
chroma that end in post now we got to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.050 
chroma that end in post now we got to
prepare<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.649> moving<00:01:28.130> blueprint<00:01:28.610> shot<00:01:28.849> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
prepare the moving blueprint shot and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.550 
prepare the moving blueprint shot and
that<00:01:29.240> was<00:01:29.420> done<00:01:29.569> by<00:01:29.690> taking<00:01:30.080> those<00:01:30.200> same

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
that was done by taking those same

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.650 
that was done by taking those same
filters<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.340> paid<00:01:31.700> shot<00:01:31.940> pro<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.300> applying

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
filters and paid shot pro and applying

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.690 
filters and paid shot pro and applying
them<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.470> shot<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.369> paint<00:01:34.550> shop<00:01:34.670> pro

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
them to this shot but paint shop pro

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.070 
them to this shot but paint shop pro
doesn't<00:01:35.090> deal<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:35.330> video<00:01:35.660> it<00:01:35.780> only<00:01:35.899> deals

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
doesn't deal with video it only deals

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.870 
doesn't deal with video it only deals
with<00:01:36.229> still<00:01:36.530> images<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.429> did<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.700> I

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
with still images so what I did is I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.089 
with still images so what I did is I
opened<00:01:38.240> up<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.360> shot<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:39.170> AVI<00:01:39.530> file<00:01:39.860> in

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
opened up that shot that AVI file in

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.400 
opened up that shot that AVI file in
virtualdub<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.119> then<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.539> exported<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.259> as

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
virtualdub and then I exported that as

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.469 
virtualdub and then I exported that as
an<00:01:42.590> image<00:01:42.920> sequence<00:01:43.489> which<00:01:43.910> basically<00:01:44.239> means

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
an image sequence which basically means

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.440 
an image sequence which basically means
one<00:01:44.840> image<00:01:45.289> per<00:01:45.590> frame<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.190> film<00:01:46.429> then<00:01:47.060> using

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
one image per frame of film then using

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.940 
one image per frame of film then using
some<00:01:47.630> batch<00:01:47.810> processing<00:01:48.500> features<00:01:48.649> in

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
some batch processing features in

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.339 
some batch processing features in
paintshop<00:01:49.190> pro<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.789> applied<00:01:50.539> those<00:01:50.750> filters<00:01:51.170> to

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
paintshop pro I applied those filters to

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.919 
paintshop pro I applied those filters to
every<00:01:51.800> frame<00:01:52.160> of<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:52.610> shot<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:53.599> I<00:01:53.720> used

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
every frame of that shot and then I used

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.839 
every frame of that shot and then I used
a<00:01:54.050> utility<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.739> reassemble<00:01:55.340> those<00:01:55.489> frames

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
a utility to reassemble those frames

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.979 
a utility to reassemble those frames
back<00:01:56.270> into<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> movie<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.340> here's<00:01:58.610> what<00:01:58.789> that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
back into a movie so here's what that

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:06.130 
back into a movie so here's what that
blueprint<00:01:59.989> shot<00:02:00.289> looks<00:02:00.530> like

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.450 

now<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.350> simply<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> matter<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> stitching

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
now is simply a matter of stitching

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.800 
now is simply a matter of stitching
these<00:02:08.580> elements<00:02:08.880> together<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> proper

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
these elements together in the proper

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
these elements together in the proper
sequence<00:02:09.960> and<00:02:10.470> crossfading<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.340> nice<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
sequence and crossfading them nice and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.300 
sequence and crossfading them nice and
smoothly<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.710> here's<00:02:13.710> what<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> final<00:02:14.190> shot

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
smoothly and here's what the final shot

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:37.160 
smoothly and here's what the final shot
looks<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.850> oh<00:02:33.320> yeah<00:02:34.320> Toyota
