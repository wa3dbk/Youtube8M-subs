let's<00:00:14.790> go<00:00:14.910> ahead<00:00:15.440> let's<00:00:16.440> pick<00:00:16.590> our<00:00:16.710> first

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
let's go ahead let's pick our first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.320 
let's go ahead let's pick our first
benchmark<00:00:17.490> test<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.990> our<00:00:22.170> first<00:00:22.380> tests<00:00:23.330> will

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
benchmark test and our first tests will

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.470 
benchmark test and our first tests will
be<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.990> Anton<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.300> some

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
be with Anton to you can see some

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.880 
be with Anton to you can see some
previous<00:00:27.810> tests<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.410> we'll<00:00:28.529> run<00:00:28.710> them

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
previous tests here but we'll run them

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
previous tests here but we'll run them
again<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.630> just<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:30.779> our<00:00:30.929> previous<00:00:31.080> test

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
again and just from our previous test

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.959 
again and just from our previous test
the<00:00:32.210> AT&amp;T<00:00:33.210> version<00:00:33.360> scored<00:00:33.960> 51<00:00:34.410> 59<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the AT&amp;T version scored 51 59 and the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
the AT&amp;T version scored 51 59 and the
t-mobile<00:00:36.450> version<00:00:36.540> cord<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.440> 766<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
t-mobile version cord for 766 but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.650 
t-mobile version cord for 766 but
running<00:00:38.579> again<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.360> let's<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.600> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
running again for you so let's do that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
running again for you so let's do that
begin<00:00:40.140> test<00:00:41.750> start<00:00:42.750> test<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> run<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
begin test start test so we run that and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
begin test start test so we run that and
after<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> quadrant<00:00:47.070> test<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
after that we do a quadrant test and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
after that we do a quadrant test and
final<00:00:48.149> benchmark<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> video<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:50.129> be

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
final benchmark with this video will be

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.209 
final benchmark with this video will be
a<00:00:50.420> speed<00:00:51.420> test<00:00:51.629> between<00:00:51.840> 4G<00:00:52.379> LTE<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
a speed test between 4G LTE on the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.569 
a speed test between 4G LTE on the
samsung<00:00:53.610> galaxy<00:00:53.969> s3<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.539> 18t<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> he<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.430> be

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
samsung galaxy s3 on 18t and he just be

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
samsung galaxy s3 on 18t and he just be
a<00:00:56.610> plus<00:00:56.969> 42<00:00:57.360> megabits<00:00:57.840> per<00:00:57.899> second<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
a plus 42 megabits per second on the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:20.100 
a plus 42 megabits per second on the
tmobile<00:00:59.370> samsung<00:00:59.670> galaxy<00:01:00.210> s3

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.510 

so<00:01:21.110> our<00:01:21.350> test<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.890> wrapped<00:01:22.100> up<00:01:22.250> here<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.490> can

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
so our test is wrapped up here you can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.080 
so our test is wrapped up here you can
see<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.759> total<00:01:23.030> score<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:24.409> ett<00:01:24.680> version<00:01:25.219> 52<00:01:25.640> 2

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
see the total score the ett version 52 2

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.710 
see the total score the ett version 52 2
3<00:01:26.619> t<00:01:27.619> mobile<00:01:27.920> version<00:01:28.220> 5020<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.360> not<00:01:29.509> far

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
3 t mobile version 5020 so not far

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.200 
3 t mobile version 5020 so not far
pretty<00:01:30.229> similar<00:01:30.649> but<00:01:30.829> of<00:01:31.549> course<00:01:31.759> i'm<00:01:31.880> running

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
pretty similar but of course i'm running

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.319 
pretty similar but of course i'm running
the<00:01:32.539> Snapdragon<00:01:33.439> s4<00:01:33.530> processor<00:01:33.979> because<00:01:34.399> okay

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
the Snapdragon s4 processor because okay

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.210 
the Snapdragon s4 processor because okay
so<00:01:35.390> let's<00:01:35.600> move<00:01:35.719> on<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.869> our<00:01:35.929> next<00:01:36.220> benchmark

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
so let's move on to our next benchmark

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.569 
so let's move on to our next benchmark
test<00:01:37.460> we're<00:01:37.700> using<00:01:37.850> quadrant<00:01:38.450> standard<00:01:39.579> open

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
test we're using quadrant standard open

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.169 
test we're using quadrant standard open
it<00:01:40.700> up<00:01:41.289> run<00:01:42.289> a<00:01:42.319> full<00:01:42.500> benchmark<00:01:42.979> again<00:01:43.280> 18t

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
it up run a full benchmark again 18t

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.279 
it up run a full benchmark again 18t
here<00:01:45.079> on<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.229> left<00:01:45.439> t-mobile<00:01:46.399> on<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.990> right

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:02:04.849 

run<00:01:51.289> our<00:01:51.470> benchmark<00:01:51.829> test

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.440 

so<00:02:05.859> it<00:02:05.979> shows<00:02:06.159> our<00:02:06.310> scores<00:02:06.609> look<00:02:06.909> at<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.060> ATT

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so it shows our scores look at the ATT

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.919 
so it shows our scores look at the ATT

support court devices is a Snapdragon s4

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.880 
support court devices is a Snapdragon s4
and<00:02:18.540> our<00:02:19.540> t-mobile<00:02:19.989> version<00:02:20.849> 33<00:02:21.849> 15<00:02:22.680> which<00:02:23.680> is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and our t-mobile version 33 15 which is

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.210 
and our t-mobile version 33 15 which is
slightly<00:02:24.700> behind<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.180> course<00:02:25.360> our<00:02:26.220> AT&amp;T

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
slightly behind of course our AT&amp;T

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.830 
slightly behind of course our AT&amp;T
version<00:02:27.549> but<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:28.000> course<00:02:28.269> behind<00:02:28.480> the

version but of course behind the
transformer<00:02:29.379> prime<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:31.120> HTC<00:02:31.930> One<00:02:32.110> X

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
transformer prime and the HTC One X

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.550 
transformer prime and the HTC One X
which<00:02:32.440> are<00:02:32.590> both<00:02:32.940> quad<00:02:33.940> core<00:02:34.330> power<00:02:35.110> devices

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
which are both quad core power devices

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.440 
which are both quad core power devices
so<00:02:36.400> there's<00:02:37.150> our<00:02:37.239> quad<00:02:37.510> results<00:02:39.329> really<00:02:40.329> as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so there's our quad results really as

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.880 
so there's our quad results really as
you<00:02:40.510> will<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.319> think<00:02:41.560> they<00:02:41.650> pretty<00:02:41.799> much

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
you will but I think they pretty much

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.100 
you will but I think they pretty much
similar<00:02:42.220> match<00:02:42.610> there<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.420> finally<00:02:43.630> let's<00:02:43.810> do

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
similar match there so finally let's do

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.800 
similar match there so finally let's do
a<00:02:44.140> speed<00:02:44.860> test<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.730> final<00:02:46.390> part<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.630> our

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
a speed test so a final part of our

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.600 
a speed test so a final part of our
benchmark<00:02:47.440> test<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.829> we're<00:02:47.980> doing<00:02:48.040> speed<00:02:48.400> test

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
benchmark test so we're doing speed test

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
six said I've been using it i was

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.340 
six said I've been using it i was
getting<00:04:07.390> an<00:04:07.480> average<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.840> about<00:04:07.930> 12<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.680> 14<00:04:09.220> so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
getting an average of about 12 to 14 so

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.870 
getting an average of about 12 to 14 so
you<00:04:11.350> know<00:04:11.470> maybe<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.860> lot<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.160> t<00:04:12.310> mobile<00:04:12.550> users

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
you know maybe a lot of t mobile users

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.550 
you know maybe a lot of t mobile users
are<00:04:13.060> using<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.600> network<00:04:13.810> right<00:04:14.080> now<00:04:14.140> since

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
are using the network right now since

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.650 
are using the network right now since
these<00:04:14.680> are<00:04:14.830> love<00:04:15.040> data<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.580> anyway<00:04:16.390> you<00:04:16.450> see

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
these are love data so anyway you see

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.150 
these are love data so anyway you see
the<00:04:16.780> speed<00:04:16.989> tests<00:04:17.290> there<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.799> can<00:04:17.980> make

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
the speed tests there you can make

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.590 
the speed tests there you can make
judgments<00:04:18.730> for<00:04:18.820> yourself<00:04:19.150> but<00:04:19.330> again

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
judgments for yourself but again

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.340 
judgments for yourself but again
especially<00:04:20.380> with<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.420> wireless<00:04:22.420> speed<00:04:23.110> test

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
especially with the wireless speed test

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.430 
especially with the wireless speed test
is<00:04:23.620> depending<00:04:24.100> on<00:04:24.190> location<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.820> area<00:04:25.440> so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
is depending on location and area so

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.520 
is depending on location and area so
this<00:04:26.650> is<00:04:26.800> not<00:04:26.950> really<00:04:27.190> true<00:04:27.640> scientific<00:04:28.530> test

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
this is not really true scientific test

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.680 
this is not really true scientific test
results<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:31.000> our<00:04:31.060> quadrant

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
results but we do have our quadrant

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.110 
results but we do have our quadrant
scores<00:04:31.960> there<00:04:32.140> they're<00:04:32.320> both<00:04:32.560> similar

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
scores there they're both similar

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.810 
scores there they're both similar
especially<00:04:34.120> in<00:04:34.180> quadrant<00:04:34.510> scores<00:04:34.890> 333<00:04:35.890> 894

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.290 
especially in quadrant scores 333 894
18t<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.870> it's<00:04:38.080> 3310<00:04:38.530> for<00:04:38.980> tmobile<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.640> terms

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
18t and it's 3310 for tmobile in terms

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.350 
18t and it's 3310 for tmobile in terms
of<00:04:40.630> antoine<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.410> slightly<00:04:42.340> higher<00:04:42.700> for<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
of antoine to slightly higher for the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.090 
of antoine to slightly higher for the
AT&amp;T<00:04:43.600> version<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:44.320> again<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.770> still<00:04:44.950> very

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
AT&amp;T version but again is still very

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.420 
AT&amp;T version but again is still very
close<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.520> similar<00:04:46.320> ballpark<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.560> there<00:04:48.310> you

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
close and similar ballpark so there you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.190 
close and similar ballpark so there you
have<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.120> have<00:04:49.300> your<00:04:49.480> speed<00:04:49.810> test<00:04:50.050> your
