00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.820
 trapezoidal threading 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.389
 diameter 68 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.389
 everything is ok six 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 hectares clean cut 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.419
 opening uterine hare thread length 750 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.439
 millimeters here now show one hand 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.439
 certainly uncomfortable but 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.060
 So 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.340
 m 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.060
 cutter 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.060
 hard alloy 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.700
 some bourgeois 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.700
 emulsion 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410
 here 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.530
 let's go now 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.710
 250 turns 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.689
 now find in the groove unplug the nut 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810
 there is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 dirt cartridge we do not stop 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.110
 constantly going chuck 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.860
 that is, open the nut as 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.890
 multiple thread pitch 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.740
 step 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.050
 12 would be 6 as i said 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.710
 Well, probably another passes 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 and there will be everything 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.900
 I already take almost nothing 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 al 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.310
 assistant 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 but 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.490
 So 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.480
 I know you can not see 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:53.980
 probably we can see the nut nut 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 ready i'm going to try spinning now 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.230
 or not should be 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.980
 he's calling 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.770
 0 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:29.010
