00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
would suggest you get the auxilary

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.440 
would suggest you get the auxilary
upgrade<00:00:33.399> critical<00:00:34.399> strikes<00:00:34.760> now<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:35.149> earn

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
upgrade critical strikes now you earn

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.319 
upgrade critical strikes now you earn
this<00:00:35.750> when<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:36.110> take<00:00:36.379> down<00:00:36.559> Shiva<00:00:37.159> so<00:00:37.940> if

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
this when you take down Shiva so if

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.660 
this when you take down Shiva so if
before<00:00:39.199> you<00:00:39.379> start<00:00:39.739> this<00:00:39.920> I<00:00:40.039> would<00:00:40.159> suggest<00:00:40.339> go

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
before you start this I would suggest go

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.509 
before you start this I would suggest go
take<00:00:40.940> 2<00:00:41.089> out<00:00:41.210> Shiva<00:00:41.690> first<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.320> then<00:00:43.190> once<00:00:43.399> you

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
take 2 out Shiva first and then once you

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.239 
take 2 out Shiva first and then once you
have<00:00:43.640> Shiva<00:00:43.909> done<00:00:44.239> then<00:00:44.929> then<00:00:45.679> start<00:00:46.039> this

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
have Shiva done then then start this

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.919 
have Shiva done then then start this
because<00:00:46.429> then<00:00:46.819> it's<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:47.300> much<00:00:47.510> simpler<00:00:47.839> to

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
because then it's it's much simpler to

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.790 
because then it's it's much simpler to
get<00:00:48.109> these<00:00:48.260> critical<00:00:48.679> strikes<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.190> need<00:00:49.629> and

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
get these critical strikes you need and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.500 
get these critical strikes you need and
I<00:00:51.800> would<00:00:51.949> also<00:00:52.159> suggest<00:00:52.519> you<00:00:52.940> probably<00:00:53.300> get

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
I would also suggest you probably get

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.340 
I would also suggest you probably get
the<00:00:53.749> combo<00:00:54.710> boost<00:00:55.449> multiplier<00:00:57.550> which<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:59.350> yeah

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the combo boost multiplier which is yeah

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.069 
the combo boost multiplier which is yeah
the<00:01:00.979> special<00:01:01.850> combo<00:01:02.210> boosts<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:02.719> then<00:01:02.870> it

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
the special combo boosts because then it

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.940 
the special combo boosts because then it
starts<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:03.739> much<00:01:03.979> quicker<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.740> what<00:01:06.740> you're

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
starts it much quicker so what you're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.350 
starts it much quicker so what you're
going<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.130> need<00:01:07.370> is<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.670> large<00:01:07.970> group<00:01:08.270> of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
going to need is a large group of

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.210 
going to need is a large group of
enemies<00:01:08.750> now<00:01:08.990> right<00:01:09.230> now<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.710> am<00:01:09.980> at<00:01:10.190> the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
enemies now right now I am at the

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.720 
enemies now right now I am at the
abandoned<00:01:10.880> court<00:01:11.120> house<00:01:11.470> there's<00:01:12.470> about<00:01:12.740> I'd

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
abandoned court house there's about I'd

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.590 
abandoned court house there's about I'd
say<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.110> 6<00:01:15.110> or<00:01:15.260> 7<00:01:15.320> if<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.220> guy<00:01:16.400> can<00:01:17.210> get<00:01:17.360> past

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
say like 6 or 7 if that guy can get past

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.230 
say like 6 or 7 if that guy can get past
the<00:01:17.780> gate<00:01:18.230> I<00:01:18.560> don't<00:01:18.830> think<00:01:18.980> you<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:19.880> 6<00:01:20.120> you

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
the gate I don't think you can but 6 you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.720 
the gate I don't think you can but 6 you
do<00:01:20.390> just<00:01:20.660> fine<00:01:20.870> now<00:01:21.140> let's<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:21.770> take<00:01:22.160> out<00:01:22.430> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
do just fine now let's just take out the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.380 
do just fine now let's just take out the
guys<00:01:22.880> with<00:01:23.210> guns<00:01:23.480> first<00:01:24.340> um<00:01:25.340> that's<00:01:25.970> probably

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
guys with guns first um that's probably

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.450 
guys with guns first um that's probably
going<00:01:26.510> to<00:01:26.570> be<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.900> simplest<00:01:27.800> way<00:01:27.980> to<00:01:28.010> do<00:01:28.280> this

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
going to be the simplest way to do this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.670 
going to be the simplest way to do this
so<00:01:28.760> they<00:01:28.880> don't<00:01:28.910> shoot<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.750> while<00:01:30.470> you're

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
so they don't shoot you while you're

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.050 
so they don't shoot you while you're
doing<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.210 

all<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.509> let's<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
all right so let's get them all and I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.289 
all right so let's get them all and I
group<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:40.610> all<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:44.030> once<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> get

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
group first all right so once you get

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
group first all right so once you get
two<00:01:45.420> times<00:01:45.689> five<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.860> these<00:01:46.979> purple

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
two times five that's when these purple

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.109 
two times five that's when these purple
strikes<00:01:47.670> start<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.649> happen<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.970> need

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
strikes start to happen so all you need

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.289 
strikes start to happen so all you need
to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.020> critical<00:01:52.409> strikes<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.920> just

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
to do for these critical strikes is just

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.960 
to do for these critical strikes is just
very<00:01:54.299> smoothly<00:01:55.229> hit<00:01:55.890> square<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.580> jam<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
very smoothly hit square don't jam it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.320 
very smoothly hit square don't jam it
down<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.979> when<00:01:58.979> you're<00:01:59.100> countering<00:01:59.580> don't

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
down and when you're countering don't

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.719 
down and when you're countering don't
jam<00:02:01.020> down<00:02:01.200> triangle<00:02:01.710> either<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.280> have

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
jam down triangle either just have

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.950 
jam down triangle either just have
square<00:02:03.330> one

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
square one

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.440 
square one
you're<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.770> tapping<00:02:05.100> Square<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:06.000> all

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.920 
getting critical strikes like crazy and
it's<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.860> take<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.549> slow<00:02:14.819> take<00:02:15.780> out

these guys that are picking up weapons

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.330
