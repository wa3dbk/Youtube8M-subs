00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.960
 we have fought we have shown up 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.030
 the last moment we found 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.490
 with a drone that has been superior in 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.480
 first the first week and nobody came 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.490
 surely stronger in that last 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.559
 week but but hey this is the 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.420
 cycling we have given everything and we were 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.690
 very happy with what made the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 balance is personal 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.620
 very good important 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.500
 work arrivals in stages in the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 first places to put pressure on 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.660
 the best of my work is very positive 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 with conscience with the heart for a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 nairo also good when he had 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 opportunity before also giving what 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 better to look for the result 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.210
 so you can swim finally it's a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 good good tour and I leave happy and 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.050
 I'm just going to wait today to spend 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.440
 the services fields and enjoy the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.440
 rest day 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.229
 yes, I knew 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:28.610
 good good now comes san sebastiÃ¡n and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.710
 return euros important to finish a tour 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.720
 of his first year in this way 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.049
 some important classifications stages 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.700
 and well the truth is that I did not first 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.229
 great I've already done or the workshop or I have 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.640
 experience in great races of three 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.920
 weeks 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.690
 the goal is currently good, not us 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.549
 it's over it's dealing with areas determine 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.500
 why is the wheel I think I do not know 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.090
 can get but how do you have to be 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.880
 a job like the one that gregarious bases 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.130
 good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.789
 let's say it's more complicated and that's why 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 I'm glad I did not get to Paris and 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.409
 well now we will look at what comes next 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.240
 forward you were thinking about the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.700
 cover tightly to win with care 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.489
 with bucket 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.830
 the play was not chosen by some carelessness or 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.739
 good career issues is that they are 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.090
 career issues and just me 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.550
 I was forward as possible to support 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.670
 nairo already when we try to go for pine 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.530
 It was complicated but, well, that is not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.150
 is that I do not know are not discussions of 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.630
 career that are unfolding sometimes 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.950
 what is spoken would not be general and leaves 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.110
 always as it is spoken in the bus but to the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.239
 end the race healing the things of 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.129
 a different way and at the end and you play 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.239
 it plays well the good moment took advantage 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.470
 to give a very special greeting to all 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.819
 the Colombian fiction all of us 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 have followed through the radio networks 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.760
 social television screen has 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.350
 been great 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.030
 through second cycling 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.250
 finally, what is born is born 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.010
 grosso things three weeks today they say that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.880
 it's going to be a walk but with this rain 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.370
 we'll see and then nothing thanks for the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.200
 support and nothing because I want to continue supporting 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.460
 with those who prescribe over there 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.460
 for the coming seasons
