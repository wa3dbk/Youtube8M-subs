00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.029
 in the professional world 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.599
 I want to invite you 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 I was together with the course called 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.199
 records 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.829
 It's a course that we've been doing for a few years now. 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.319
 basically 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.109
 everything worked 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.030
 Let's get tired of the speeches. 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.050
 we really brought 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 revolutionary technicians and we were also the first of Brazil 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.390
 given as oysters works in manique doll that today 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.160
 virtually 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 the world of teaching already directs 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 she is the picture shows some pictures to follow 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.890
 I say the application for a hospital arrest but admits that the defeat of the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.640
 lakers 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.730
 on the ground to the rebels already made with trends and fashion news 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.950
 the wave you 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.830
 can evaluate with our work has 50 years of profession in norfolk narrate 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 fifty years of the professional why 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.240
 Brazil already knows 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300
 and sat the hospital structure 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000
 and this course is not taxed 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.280
 or make you stop being a professional that you 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.240
 you're just going to grow up 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.510
 fundamental techniques 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 to facilitate with certainty 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.100
 because the day 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.070
 the haircut aunt 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.010
 or better 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.250
 wow we do not teach 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.159
 the bet he gave 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.420
 nor do we say that the student understands here that in three days or a week 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.479
 cut hair or is it a professional no one learns the bill that dell in 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.200
 three of the Libyan leader 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.460
 and a lot of it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 You're a pro which I'm inviting. 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.720
 You repeat, finding techniques is not for cutting your hair. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.150
 in all chapters what you 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.549
 Do you want to stay here? 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.089
 There is only one way that this can happen. 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.089
 If you believe that I'm telling you 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.779
 You're not going to be the same professional. 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:19.879
 never 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.529
 You'll think of a different way. 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.589
 your technical content is certain 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.659
 it will change 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.609
 and if you come, have any questions 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.559
 It is very professional and from now on 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.039
 if you promote or 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.129
 already found new directions 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.639
 within the techniques because we create
