I don't know if it's right now it's just

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.380 
I don't know if it's right now it's just
a<00:00:33.809> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.020> work<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.890> starting<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> brainstorm

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
a lot of work and starting to brainstorm

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.350 
a lot of work and starting to brainstorm
on<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.960> upcoming<00:00:37.260> big<00:00:37.860> project<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> it's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
on this upcoming big project and it's

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.639 
on this upcoming big project and it's
quite<00:00:39.540> challenging<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> ball

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
quite challenging to get the ball

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.040 
quite challenging to get the ball
rolling<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> beginning<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
rolling in the beginning but I think the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.740 
rolling in the beginning but I think the
courses<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.590> we've<00:00:43.770> had<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:45.210> help<00:00:45.450> with

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
courses that we've had to to help with

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
courses that we've had to to help with
the<00:00:46.079> process<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:47.070> been<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.090> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the process have been really good you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
the process have been really good you
really<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.780> step<00:00:49.200> by<00:00:49.410> step<00:00:49.680> by<00:00:49.890> step<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
really see like step by step by step I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.189 
really see like step by step by step I
would<00:00:50.640> say<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> typical<00:00:51.539> day<00:00:51.660> honking

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
would say that typical day honking

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.670 
would say that typical day honking
consists<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.960> well<00:00:54.960> most<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> my<00:00:55.260> classes<00:00:55.500> are

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
consists of well most of my classes are

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
consists of well most of my classes are

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.240 
easy to approach and you get to know
them<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.600> that's

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
them and they get to know you so that's

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.740 
them and they get to know you so that's
that's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.520> positive<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.509> would

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that's a really positive thing I would

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.179 
that's a really positive thing I would
think<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.350> there's<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> big<00:01:52.740> power

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
think so there's not a big power

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
think so there's not a big power
distance<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:56.430> otherwise<00:01:56.909> yeah<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
distance and and otherwise yeah the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.969 
distance and and otherwise yeah the
atmosphere<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> easygoing<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
atmosphere is easygoing you know the

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.179 
atmosphere is easygoing you know the
students<00:02:00.759> are<00:02:00.880> friendly<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.960> nothing<00:02:02.619> scary

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
students are friendly it's nothing scary

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.899 
students are friendly it's nothing scary
we<00:02:03.369> don't<00:02:03.520> wear<00:02:03.640> suits<00:02:03.880> around<00:02:04.270> peers<00:02:05.909> there's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
we don't wear suits around peers there's

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.210 
we don't wear suits around peers there's
a<00:02:07.030> certain<00:02:07.509> amount<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.110> choice<00:02:08.349> but<00:02:09.009> at<00:02:09.130> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
a certain amount of choice but at the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.440 
a certain amount of choice but at the
same<00:02:09.340> time<00:02:09.550> there<00:02:09.729> are<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.970> courses<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.300> you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
same time there are the courses that you

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.120 
same time there are the courses that you
have<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.780> take<00:02:10.989> but<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.920> year<00:02:12.099> I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
have to take but then this year I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
have to take but then this year I
decided<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.849> just<00:02:12.910> didn't<00:02:13.390> want<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.569> take

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
decided that I just didn't want to take

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.210 
decided that I just didn't want to take
one<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.020> them<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.319> I'll<00:02:14.440> take<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.770> next<00:02:14.920> year

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
one of them so I'll take it next year

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.800 
one of them so I'll take it next year
and<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:18.459> was<00:02:18.610> nice<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.090> got<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.569> choice

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
and so it was nice that I got the choice

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.240 
and so it was nice that I got the choice
and<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.140> wasn't<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.739> know<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.010> end<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
and it wasn't you know the end of the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
and it wasn't you know the end of the
world<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.700> take<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.150> later<00:02:22.420> no<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.319> definitely

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
world to take it later no I definitely

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.320 
world to take it later no I definitely
think<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.700> having<00:02:24.880> people<00:02:25.180> from

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
think that you know having people from

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.559 
think that you know having people from
all<00:02:25.660> over<00:02:25.690> brings<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.410> certain<00:02:26.560> mix<00:02:27.550> into<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.300> so

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
all over brings a certain mix into it so

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.479 
all over brings a certain mix into it so
you<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.680> especially<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.220> group

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
you have you know especially the group

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.930 
you have you know especially the group
work<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.910> mentioned<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:31.989> have<00:02:32.940> there's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
work that I mentioned we have there's

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.729
