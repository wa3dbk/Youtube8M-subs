00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.980
 hi then i make this video for 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.669
 clarify once and for all well 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:24.129
 the use of cleansing milk and 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:28.340
 make-up remover because I see around 

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:31.730
 d'orlando are on the internet of 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.690
 reviews that reject milk a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.199
 cleansing milk because it does not remove well 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.480
 the cleansing net makeup does not have the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.420
 function to remove makeup 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.760
 function to remove the dirt from the store 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.200
 from the skin, etc. when for example 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.360
 we raise our faces in the morning but for 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.420
 then remove make-up to dissolve the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 trick you need to use one 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.590
 so make up remover when it's a trick 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.899
 quite heavy as in this case 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 what you do before you use one 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.329
 make-up remover an oily makeup remover 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.899
 possibly to better dissolve the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:19.340
 makeup then switch to cleansing milk 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.740
 to remove both the rest of the makeup 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.469
 maybe the base that is the easiest one 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 to be removed and subsequently for 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.549
 also remove the makeup remover that 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.709
 we have applied before then also 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.499
 wrong use before the milk 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.049
 cleanser and then make-up remover because 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:40.249
 otherwise we should find the name of the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.689
 face to remove the makeup remover on the 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.929
 eyes and then we'll do 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.060
 let's say we stress the skin twice 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.369
 instead using the make-up remover first 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.990
 those wait for cleansing gel we are 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.139
 sure and have removed everything then 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.819
 we do not use cleansing milk for 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:02.959
 make up to the max like I do 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.329
 let's use it when we have a trick 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.270
 very light example just a thread of 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.230
 mascara or had just a little 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 eye shadow there cleansing milk can already 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.790
 be sufficient 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.560
 but if the make-up is heavy we cannot 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.410
 claim that a cleansing milk will carry 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.740
 away all the makeup especially if 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.720
 just a fairly intense makeup goes 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.440
 well this was all we'll see at 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.440
 next hello
