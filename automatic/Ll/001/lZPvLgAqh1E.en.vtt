00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.419 

my<00:00:09.570> powerful<00:00:10.080> effects<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.769> mentalism<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
my powerful effects that mentalism is

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.999 
my powerful effects that mentalism is
the<00:00:11.969> ability<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.690> duplicate<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the ability to duplicate what a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
the ability to duplicate what a
spectator<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> thinking<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
spectator is thinking and one of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.340 
spectator is thinking and one of the
easiest<00:00:16.800> ways<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.810> is<00:00:18.810> using<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
easiest ways to do that is using a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.340 
easiest ways to do that is using a
forcing<00:00:19.770> bag<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> basically<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.840> show<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
forcing bag so basically you show the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.040 
forcing bag so basically you show the
pad<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> spectator<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.600> show<00:00:24.810> them

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
pad to the spectator and you show them

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.650 
pad to the spectator and you show them
that<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.740> words<00:00:26.010> are<00:00:26.849> different<00:00:26.910> each

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that all the words are different each

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
that all the words are different each
and<00:00:28.109> every<00:00:28.349> page<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.189> different<00:00:29.699> word<00:00:29.910> on

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and every page has a different word on

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
and every page has a different word on
it<00:00:31.369> all<00:00:32.369> right

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it all right

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
it all right
so<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.630> hold<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.140> forcing<00:00:34.829> pad<00:00:35.070> in

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
so they would hold the forcing pad in

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.680 
so they would hold the forcing pad in
their<00:00:35.910> hand<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.280> merely<00:00:38.450> riffle<00:00:39.450> through<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
their hand and merely riffle through the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.580 
their hand and merely riffle through the
pages<00:00:40.100> stop<00:00:41.100> anywhere<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:42.440> all<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
pages stop anywhere they want all right

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.790 
pages stop anywhere they want all right
look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> word<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.840> case<00:00:46.079> compact

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
look at the word in this case compact

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
look at the word in this case compact
disc<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.120> again<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.539> don't<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> thing

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
disc and again you don't see this thing

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.900 
disc and again you don't see this thing
you're<00:00:49.649> turned<00:00:49.890> away<00:00:50.750> close<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> pad<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
you're turned away close the pad up and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.450 
you're turned away close the pad up and
then<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.180> would<00:00:54.329> draw<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> exact<00:00:56.550> same<00:00:57.149> thing

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
then you would draw the exact same thing

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.700 
then you would draw the exact same thing
or<00:00:59.460> similar<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> both<00:01:01.170> turn<00:01:01.440> over

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
or similar and then you both turn over

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
or similar and then you both turn over
your<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:02.789> pads<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.600> papers<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.170> your

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
your your pads your papers and your

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.249 
your your pads your papers and your
reveal<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.769> drawing

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.859 

basically<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.460> works<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.969> these<00:01:12.240> fin<00:01:12.600> gali

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
basically this works on these fin gali

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
basically this works on these fin gali
principle<00:01:14.240> alright<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.539> that<00:01:16.229> means<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
principle alright and that means if you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.800 
principle alright and that means if you
riffle<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> pages<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> way<00:01:19.579> they're<00:01:20.579> all

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
riffle the pages this way they're all

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.469 
riffle the pages this way they're all
different<00:01:21.810> words<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.969> riffle<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
different words but if you riffle the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.899 
different words but if you riffle the
pages<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.350> you're<00:01:25.799> left<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.220> using<00:01:26.789> your

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pages this way you're left in using your

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
pages this way you're left in using your
right<00:01:27.030> hand<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> words<00:01:29.149> are<00:01:30.149> all<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.560> same

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
right hand the words are all the same

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.929 
right hand the words are all the same
believe<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:33.719> biggest<00:01:34.170> flaw<00:01:34.939> with

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
believe it or not the biggest flaw with

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.529 
believe it or not the biggest flaw with
the<00:01:36.119> spin<00:01:36.390> gali<00:01:36.659> principle<00:01:37.289> is<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.819> the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
the spin gali principle is that all the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.249 
the spin gali principle is that all the
cards<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:40.110> words<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.950> case<00:01:41.189> are<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> same

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
cards or words in this case are the same

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.120 
cards or words in this case are the same
so<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.849> for<00:01:44.849> a<00:01:44.909> countermeasure<00:01:46.130> we've

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
so what for a countermeasure we've

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.089 
so what for a countermeasure we've
created<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.819> list<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.299> synonyms<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.890> are

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
created a list of synonyms which are

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.190 
created a list of synonyms which are
words<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.789> are<00:01:51.329> those<00:01:51.569> spelt<00:01:52.110> differently

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
words that are those spelt differently

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770 
words that are those spelt differently
and<00:01:52.709> look<00:01:52.770> differently<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.390> very

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and look differently are actually very

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.850 
and look differently are actually very
similar<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.709> manner<00:01:56.720> all<00:01:57.720> right<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
similar in manner all right and the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.120 
similar in manner all right and the
reason<00:01:59.039> we<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.429> that<00:01:59.459> is<00:01:59.819> so<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.770> less

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
reason we do that is so it's less

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.059 
reason we do that is so it's less
noticeable<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.509> stand<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> initial

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
noticeable it can stand up to initial

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.839 
noticeable it can stand up to initial
brief<00:02:05.429> examination<00:02:07.099> they<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.340> riffle<00:02:08.759> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
brief examination they can riffle it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.449 
brief examination they can riffle it
both<00:02:09.060> ways<00:02:09.329> and<00:02:09.899> they'll<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
both ways and they'll see that all the

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
both ways and they'll see that all the
words<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.849> different<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.049> they<00:02:13.200> happen

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
words are different and if they happen

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.830 
words are different and if they happen
to<00:02:13.739> look<00:02:13.890> down<00:02:14.209> when<00:02:15.209> they're<00:02:15.359> rippling<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
to look down when they're rippling the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.629 
to look down when they're rippling the
page<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.170> their<00:02:16.290> left<00:02:16.440> hands<00:02:16.889> they<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.370> still

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
page in their left hands they can still

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.280 
page in their left hands they can still
see<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.150> every<00:02:18.690> word<00:02:19.049> is<00:02:19.459> different<00:02:21.290> all

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
see that every word is different all

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
see that every word is different all
right

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
right

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.530 
right
so<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.850> stands<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.389> to<00:02:24.450> brief<00:02:25.049> examination

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
so it stands up to brief examination

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.650 
so it stands up to brief examination
while<00:02:27.540> still<00:02:27.930> maintaining<00:02:28.139> the<00:02:28.980> Svengali

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
while still maintaining the Svengali

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.479 
while still maintaining the Svengali
principle<00:02:31.400> all<00:02:32.400> right<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.840> case

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
principle all right so in this case

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.550 
principle all right so in this case
we're<00:02:35.489> using<00:02:35.519> words<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:38.060> resemble

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
we're using words that all resemble

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.120 
we're using words that all resemble
force<00:02:40.560> words<00:02:40.889> that<00:02:41.549> all<00:02:41.700> resemble<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:43.130> all

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
force words that all resemble this all

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.990

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
even saucer all have to do with food so

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.589 
even saucer all have to do with food so
when<00:05:05.280> you're<00:05:05.430> doing<00:05:05.700> your<00:05:05.729> mentalism<00:05:06.300> patter

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
when you're doing your mentalism patter

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.500 
when you're doing your mentalism patter
and<00:05:06.990> you're<00:05:07.110> saying<00:05:07.349> I'm<00:05:07.940> getting<00:05:08.940> some<00:05:09.210> sort

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
and you're saying I'm getting some sort

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.040 
and you're saying I'm getting some sort
of<00:05:10.460> item<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.760> would<00:05:11.909> eat<00:05:12.210> some<00:05:12.750> sort<00:05:12.960> of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
of item that you would eat some sort of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.360 
of item that you would eat some sort of
food<00:05:13.409> item<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.210> then<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.360> draw<00:05:15.690> out<00:05:16.370> your

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
food item and then you draw out your

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.719 
food item and then you draw out your
food<00:05:17.639> item<00:05:17.969> on<00:05:18.150> your<00:05:18.210> pad<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:20.400> that's<00:05:20.580> just

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
food item on your pad so that's just

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.610 
food item on your pad so that's just
another<00:05:20.940> little<00:05:21.479> added<00:05:21.630> bonus

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.530 

so<00:05:27.160> basically<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.760> put<00:05:27.790> in<00:05:28.060> different<00:05:28.390> words

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
so basically you put in different words

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.500 
so basically you put in different words
on<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:32.230> first<00:05:32.500> page<00:05:32.820> second<00:05:33.820> page<00:05:33.850> gets<00:05:34.360> your

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
on the first page second page gets your

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.570 
on the first page second page gets your
force<00:05:34.810> word<00:05:35.080> followed<00:05:35.950> by<00:05:36.100> another<00:05:36.400> in

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
force word followed by another in

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.940 
force word followed by another in
different<00:05:36.610> word<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.360> then<00:05:38.050> every<00:05:38.470> other<00:05:38.500> page

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
different word and then every other page

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.880 
different word and then every other page
is<00:05:39.190> your<00:05:39.340> force<00:05:39.580> word<00:05:39.850> all<00:05:40.540> right<00:05:40.830> now<00:05:41.830> you

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
is your force word all right now you

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.030 
is your force word all right now you
need<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.490> make<00:05:42.640> it<00:05:42.850> spin<00:05:43.450> golly<00:05:43.750> like<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.650> just

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
need to make it spin golly like so just

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.830 
need to make it spin golly like so just
