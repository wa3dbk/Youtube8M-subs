that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.270> know<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.750> transformers

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that you know just like transformers

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.560 
that you know just like transformers
they<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.710> never<00:00:49.890> always<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.570> completely

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they would never always be completely

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
they would never always be completely
perfect<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.199> shiny<00:00:52.440> looking<00:00:52.829> they're<00:00:53.280> always

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
perfect or shiny looking they're always

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
perfect or shiny looking they're always
gonna<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.879> scrapes<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> scruffs<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
gonna be scrapes and scruffs here and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
on this figure but just make it visible

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.120 
on this figure but just make it visible
that<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> possible<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.680> here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that it is possible so here and there on

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.289 
that it is possible so here and there on
the<00:01:08.159> sphere<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.210> bit

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the sphere you see a little bit

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
the sphere you see a little bit
scratches<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.560> wearing<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.520> him

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
scratches a little bit wearing on him

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.230 
scratches a little bit wearing on him
but<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.540> too<00:01:12.810> overbearing<00:01:13.140> though

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
but it's not too overbearing though

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.050 
but it's not too overbearing though
let's<00:01:15.240> take<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:15.830> down<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.820> helmet

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
let's take a look down on this helmet

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.490 
let's take a look down on this helmet
too

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.850 

besides<00:01:24.140> especially<00:01:25.140> when<00:01:25.230> it's<00:01:25.320> flying<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
besides especially when it's flying you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:41.050 
besides especially when it's flying you
know<00:01:25.980> it<00:01:26.700> does<00:01:26.880> make<00:01:27.120> a<00:01:27.510> difference

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.860 

till<00:01:42.060> he<00:01:42.149> goes<00:01:42.240> back

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.830 

I<00:01:46.930> try<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.770> make<00:01:48.040> this<00:01:48.250> figure<00:01:49.180> as<00:01:49.300> detail<00:01:49.720> as

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
I try to make this figure as detail as

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.110 
I try to make this figure as detail as
possible<00:01:49.900> even<00:01:50.590> getting<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.010> grooves<00:01:51.340> as

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
possible even getting to the grooves as

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.760 
possible even getting to the grooves as
you<00:01:52.270> can<00:01:52.390> see<00:01:52.600> compared<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.380> use<00:01:53.500> 2<00:01:53.530> figures

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you can see compared to use 2 figures

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can see compared to use 2 figures
getting<00:01:54.190> through<00:01:54.340> all<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.580> small<00:01:55.030> grooves<00:01:55.390> to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
getting through all the small grooves to

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.070 
getting through all the small grooves to
fill<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.960> into<00:01:56.110> black<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:57.670> really<00:01:58.080> makes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
fill it into black actually really makes

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.940 
fill it into black actually really makes
the<00:01:59.260> figure<00:01:59.500> pop<00:01:59.830> a<00:01:59.860> little<00:02:00.160> more<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.370> feel<00:02:00.610> like

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the figure pop a little more I feel like

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:16.700 
the figure pop a little more I feel like
side-by-side

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.470 

for<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.190> figure<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:17.610> he<00:02:17.880> has<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> removable

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
for this figure also he has a removable

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.320 
for this figure also he has a removable
helmet<00:02:18.960> which<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.680> really<00:02:19.920> happy<00:02:20.100> about

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
and get Tony Stark I this part was
actually<00:02:29.850> inspired<00:02:30.210> by<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> Avengers<00:02:31.080> movie

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
actually inspired by the Avengers movie

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.730 
actually inspired by the Avengers movie
for<00:02:31.530> me<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:33.030> Tony<00:02:33.570> Stark<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
for me as Tony Stark is with the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.160 
for me as Tony Stark is with the
Avengers<00:02:35.040> fighting<00:02:35.670> all<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.150> aliens<00:02:36.540> when<00:02:37.110> he

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
Avengers fighting all the aliens when he

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
Avengers fighting all the aliens when he
had<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.410> shots<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.800> him<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.190> his<00:02:38.280> helmet<00:02:38.540> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
had the shots of him in his helmet is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260 
had the shots of him in his helmet is
visibly<00:02:39.960> he<00:02:40.140> has<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.650> lot<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.280> cuts<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.180> bruises

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
visibly he has a lot of cuts and bruises

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.990 
visibly he has a lot of cuts and bruises
on<00:02:42.870> his<00:02:43.110> face<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.890> thought<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.640> was<00:02:44.820> more

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
on his face so I thought that was more

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210 
on his face so I thought that was more
realistic<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> actually<00:02:46.620> added<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> little

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
realistic so I actually added a little

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.780 
realistic so I actually added a little
bit<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.520> him

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.730 

so<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.820> thought<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> came<00:02:51.330> out<00:02:51.450> pretty<00:02:51.540> well<00:02:51.740> not

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
so I thought it came out pretty well not

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.930 
so I thought it came out pretty well not
too<00:02:52.920> much<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.520> covering<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:53.880> whole

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
too much so it's covering this whole

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.770 
too much so it's covering this whole
face<00:02:54.240> still<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.840> sides<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
face still but just on the sides and the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.470 
face still but just on the sides and the
helmet<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:58.260> slips<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.890> easily<00:02:59.480> just

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
helmet just slips on really easily just

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.310 
helmet just slips on really easily just
like<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.700> there<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.790> go

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
like that there you go

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.190 
like that there you go
