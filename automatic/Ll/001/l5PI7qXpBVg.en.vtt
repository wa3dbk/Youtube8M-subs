cos lettuce and the salad dressing that
I'm<00:01:24.040> going<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.310> make<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.990> common<00:01:26.380> one

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
I'm going to make is this common one

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440 
I'm going to make is this common one
that<00:01:26.710> I've<00:01:27.130> heard<00:01:27.520> around<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.880> plant<00:01:28.210> based

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
that I've heard around the plant based

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.140 
that I've heard around the plant based
world<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.710> three<00:01:29.980> to<00:01:30.160> one<00:01:30.430> ratio<00:01:30.460> of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
world it's that three to one ratio of

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.680 
world it's that three to one ratio of
the<00:01:31.510> balsamic<00:01:32.350> vinegar<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:34.060> like<00:01:34.300> for<00:01:34.600> example

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
the balsamic vinegar so like for example

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.780 
the balsamic vinegar so like for example
three<00:01:35.260> tests<00:01:35.680> tablespoons<00:01:36.370> of<00:01:36.610> vinegar<00:01:37.570> with

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
three tests tablespoons of vinegar with

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.190 
three tests tablespoons of vinegar with
2<00:01:39.790> tablespoons<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.530> Dijon<00:01:42.070> mustard<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:43.200> 1

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
2 tablespoons of the Dijon mustard and 1

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.550 
2 tablespoons of the Dijon mustard and 1
tablespoon<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.220> maple<00:01:45.580> syrup<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:47.290> I

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
tablespoon of the maple syrup I think I

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.320 
tablespoon of the maple syrup I think I
will<00:01:48.159> probably<00:01:48.400> not<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.909> follow<00:01:49.150> that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
will probably not really follow that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.310 
will probably not really follow that
ratio<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.050> might<00:01:50.620> even<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:51.870> taste<00:01:52.870> it<00:01:53.020> as<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.290> go

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
ratio I might even just taste it as I go

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.340 
ratio I might even just taste it as I go
I<00:01:53.830> like<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> bit<00:01:54.940> sweeter<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.659> with<00:01:55.900> less<00:01:56.110> of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
I like it a bit sweeter and with less of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.350 
I like it a bit sweeter and with less of
the<00:01:56.470> vinegar<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.220> might<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.790> make<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.030> like

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
the vinegar so I might just make it like

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.380 
the vinegar so I might just make it like
a<00:01:58.770> 2<00:01:59.770> to<00:02:00.479> 2<00:02:01.479> ratio<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.070> equal<00:02:03.610> amounts<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.120> each

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
a 2 to 2 ratio so equal amounts of each

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.789 
a 2 to 2 ratio so equal amounts of each
one<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.530> I'll<00:02:05.770> mix<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.799> little

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
one and so I'll mix that in this little

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.190 
one and so I'll mix that in this little
Bowl<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.220> then<00:02:09.610> I'll<00:02:09.789> pour<00:02:10.659> it<00:02:10.810> over<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
Bowl and then I'll pour it over the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.290 
Bowl and then I'll pour it over the
potatoes<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.280> lettuce<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.790> eat<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> like

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
potatoes and the lettuce and eat it like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.480 
potatoes and the lettuce and eat it like
that<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.709> simple<00:02:15.130> lunch

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
that so just a simple lunch

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.570 
that so just a simple lunch
because<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:18.140> am<00:02:18.440> NOT<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.830> very<00:02:19.040> good<00:02:19.160> cook

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
because I just am NOT a very good cook

minutes last week and then my husband
got<00:02:54.500> tired<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.040> slept<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:55.850> then<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.540> had<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.840> go

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
got tired and slept and then I had to go

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.840 
got tired and slept and then I had to go
as<00:02:57.140> well<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.190> watch<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.490> rest<00:02:58.520> of

as well so I going to watch the rest of
it<00:02:59.000> and<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:02.230> think<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.320> was<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.470> pretty

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
it and I think it was a pretty

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.220 
it and I think it was a pretty
interesting<00:03:04.340> documentary<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:06.070> not<00:03:07.070> as

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
interesting documentary it's not as

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.530 
interesting documentary it's not as
engaging<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.610> fat<00:03:10.610> sick<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.090> nearly<00:03:11.120> dead

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
engaging as fat sick and nearly dead

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.190 
engaging as fat sick and nearly dead
which<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.080> another<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.010> watched<00:03:13.730> a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.100 
which is another one that I watched a
while<00:03:15.200> ago<00:03:15.670> mainly<00:03:16.670> because<00:03:17.000> there<00:03:17.810> doesn't

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
while ago mainly because there doesn't

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.980 
while ago mainly because there doesn't
seem<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.610> any<00:03:20.080> main<00:03:21.080> characters<00:03:21.710> in<00:03:21.920> this

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.810 
seem to be any main characters in this
it<00:03:23.990> does<00:03:24.260> ask<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.740> lot<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.890> opinions<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.580> other

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
it does ask a lot of opinions of other

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.970 
it does ask a lot of opinions of other
people<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.480> public<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.170> then<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.800> hear

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980

Fuhrman<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.570> usual<00:03:35.750> plant-based<00:03:36.260> doctors

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
Fuhrman so the usual plant-based doctors

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.120 
Fuhrman so the usual plant-based doctors
and<00:03:37.100> my<00:03:38.030> husband<00:03:38.390> was<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:39.740> always<00:03:39.860> see

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
and my husband was like we always see

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.860 
and my husband was like we always see
the<00:03:40.250> same<00:03:40.280> people<00:03:40.610> in<00:03:41.000> these<00:03:41.150> documentaries

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the same people in these documentaries

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.670 
the same people in these documentaries
and<00:03:43.180> maybe<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.360> would<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.660> even<00:03:44.960> more<00:03:45.200> credible

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
and maybe it would be even more credible

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.040 
and maybe it would be even more credible
if<00:03:45.860> we<00:03:46.010> saw<00:03:46.220> like<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.670> wider<00:03:47.000> variety<00:03:47.210> of<00:03:47.510> people

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
if we saw like a wider variety of people

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.190 
if we saw like a wider variety of people
talking<00:03:48.800> about<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.310> science<00:03:49.730> behind<00:03:50.200> milk

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
talking about the science behind milk

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.370 
talking about the science behind milk
and<00:03:51.440> meat<00:03:51.800> consumption<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:54.110> was<00:03:54.230> his

and meat consumption so that was his

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.870 
and meat consumption so that was his
thoughts<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.600> but<00:03:56.600> I<00:03:56.930> guess<00:03:57.920> there's<00:03:58.730> not
