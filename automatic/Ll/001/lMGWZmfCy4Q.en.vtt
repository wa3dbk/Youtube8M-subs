00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
stage at least there aren't so many big

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
tournaments in the world for females how

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.869 
tournaments in the world for females how
does<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> affect<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:37.140> training<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
does this affect your training or to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.930 
does this affect your training or to
keep<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> momentum<00:00:40.010> well<00:00:41.010> sometimes<00:00:41.760> it's

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
keep up the momentum well sometimes it's

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.619 
keep up the momentum well sometimes it's
hard<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.300> last<00:00:42.660> year<00:00:42.930> acc<00:00:43.649> wasn't<00:00:44.070> them

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
hard like last year acc wasn't them

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
hard like last year acc wasn't them
there<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.780> no<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> was<00:00:47.370> really

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
there was no way to see so it was really

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
there was no way to see so it was really
hard<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.030> keep<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.450> motivation<00:00:48.600> going

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
hard to like keep the motivation going

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
hard to like keep the motivation going
when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.920> any<00:00:50.160> events<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
when you don't have any events to go to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.330 
when you don't have any events to go to
especially<00:00:51.210> such<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> big<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
especially such a big one like this so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
especially such a big one like this so
today<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.120> year<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.570> been<00:00:54.660> easier<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.350> us

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
today this year it's been easier for us

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200 
today this year it's been easier for us
because<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.120> know

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
as possible as a female in

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
as possible as a female in
counter-strike<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.549> ever<00:01:20.700> feel

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
counter-strike to ever feel

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
counter-strike to ever feel
discriminated<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.369> compare

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
discriminated here if you compare

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.170 
discriminated here if you compare
yourself<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.299> men<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:26.180> really

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
yourself with the men not really

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
yourself with the men not really
discriminated<00:01:27.869> maybe<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.950> course<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
discriminated maybe of course it's a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
discriminated maybe of course it's a
different<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> female<00:01:30.630> because

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
different to be a female because

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.840 
different to be a female because
everybody<00:01:32.250> think<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> there's<00:01:32.790> no

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
everybody think is that there's no

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.859 
everybody think is that there's no
difference<00:01:33.270> between<00:01:33.329> male<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.720> female

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
difference between male and female

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.380 
difference between male and female
income<00:01:34.409> strike<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:35.939> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
income strike but I think there is so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
income strike but I think there is so
that's<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:37.920> discrimination

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that's like if there's discrimination

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
that's like if there's discrimination
that's<00:01:39.030> why<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.259> men<00:01:40.799> they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that's why you know because men they

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.880 
that's why you know because men they
think<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:42.000> no<00:01:42.119> difference<00:01:42.890> your

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think that there's no difference your

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.929 
think that there's no difference your
biggest<00:01:44.130> opponent<00:01:44.970> SK<00:01:45.600> gaming<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
biggest opponent SK gaming have a really
