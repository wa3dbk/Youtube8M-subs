00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
chordal shape starting with C we're

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.650 
chordal shape starting with C we're
gonna<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> bottom<00:03:10.420> four<00:03:11.080> strings<00:03:12.300> CMP<00:03:13.300> fly

gonna do the bottom four strings CMP fly
to<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.340> okay<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:18.190> let's<00:03:18.400> say<00:03:18.550> over<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.880> f7<00:03:19.330> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
to you okay and let's say over the f7 I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.540 
to you okay and let's say over the f7 I
want<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> do<00:03:20.470> this<00:03:21.570> as<00:03:22.570> we<00:03:22.720> want<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.900> take<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.260> up

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
want to do this as we want to take it up

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.140 
want to do this as we want to take it up
half<00:03:24.550> step<00:03:24.910> okay<00:03:26.100> now<00:03:27.100> when<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.370> resolve<00:03:27.790> to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
half step okay now when we resolve to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.920 
half step okay now when we resolve to
b-flat

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
b-flat

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.650 
b-flat
I'm<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> go<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:29.709> another<00:03:29.920> half<00:03:30.130> step<00:03:30.660> we

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
I'm going to go up another half step we

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440 
I'm going to go up another half step we
got<00:03:31.810> chromaticism<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.769> here<00:03:32.950> was<00:03:33.130> no<00:03:33.250> salad

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
got chromaticism so here was no salad

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.760 
got chromaticism so here was no salad
I'm<00:03:35.840> putting<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> low<00:03:36.410> C<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:36.890> there<00:03:37.069> so

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
I'm putting a low C in there so

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.940 
I'm putting a low C in there so
now<00:03:39.310> I'm<00:03:39.430> gonna<00:03:39.520> go<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.820> f7<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:43.770> it's<00:03:44.770> like<00:03:44.920> a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
now I'm gonna go to f7 like it's like a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.730 
now I'm gonna go to f7 like it's like a
real<00:03:45.190> real<00:03:46.120> altered<00:03:46.600> sound<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.170> then<00:03:47.530> when<00:03:47.650> I

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
real real altered sound and then when I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.210 
real real altered sound and then when I
go<00:03:47.860> up<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.010> here<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:51.190> again<00:03:51.550> it's<00:03:51.850> um<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.220> you

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
go up to here it's again it's um so you

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.440 
go up to here it's again it's um so you
know<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.490> goes<00:03:54.640> right<00:03:54.850> back<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.150> b-flat

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
know that goes right back in the b-flat

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.140 
know that goes right back in the b-flat
so<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.290> first<00:03:56.530> thing<00:03:56.770> I<00:03:57.100> recommend<00:03:57.490> trying<00:03:57.970> to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
so the first thing I recommend trying to

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.390 
so the first thing I recommend trying to
do<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:59.080> taking<00:03:59.760> voicings<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.240> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
do is it's taking voicings like that and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.830 
do is it's taking voicings like that and
this<00:04:03.400> doesn't<00:04:03.760> only<00:04:03.850> go<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> quartile

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
this doesn't only go for a quartile

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.130 
this doesn't only go for a quartile
playing<00:04:05.200> goes<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.800> um<00:04:06.240> for<00:04:07.240> just<00:04:07.750> as<00:04:07.930> any

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
playing goes for um for just as any

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.520 
playing goes for um for just as any
voicings<00:04:08.710> is<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.280> should<00:04:09.490> take<00:04:10.050> two<00:04:11.050> five<00:04:11.290> one

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
voicings is you should take two five one

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.440 
voicings is you should take two five one
patterns<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.160> try<00:04:12.460> to<00:04:12.520> move<00:04:12.760> as<00:04:12.940> little<00:04:13.300> as

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
patterns and try to move as little as

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.900 
patterns and try to move as little as
possible<00:04:13.660> if<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.530> can<00:04:14.680> move<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.340> half<00:04:15.580> steps

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
possible if you can move in half steps

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.610 
possible if you can move in half steps
that<00:04:16.180> that's<00:04:16.450> terrific<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.320> G<00:04:18.130> C<00:04:18.760> F<00:04:19.030> B<00:04:19.570> flat<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
that that's terrific so G C F B flat and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.660 
that that's terrific so G C F B flat and
10th<00:04:20.950> position<00:04:22.830> fifth<00:04:23.830> strength<00:04:24.160> or<00:04:24.340> second
