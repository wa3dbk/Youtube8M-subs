00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay so this is the second video I'm

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.760 
okay so this is the second video I'm
doing<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> quick<00:00:05.279> unboxing<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:06.180> the

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
doing this is a quick unboxing of the

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.250 
doing this is a quick unboxing of the
tunze<00:00:07.770> osmolator<00:00:08.690> just<00:00:09.690> see<00:00:09.780> what's<00:00:09.929> inside<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
tunze osmolator just see what's inside I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:28.810 
tunze osmolator just see what's inside I
guess<00:00:18.890> some<00:00:19.890> paperwork

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:46.729 

the<00:00:29.820> u<00:00:29.880> controller<00:00:43.520> tubing<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.649> don't<00:00:46.649> know

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the u controller tubing I don't know

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
the u controller tubing I don't know
what<00:00:46.829> these<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.750> we'll<00:00:48.750> figure<00:00:48.899> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
what these are just we'll figure that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:01.130 
what these are just we'll figure that
out<00:00:57.469> probably<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> sensors<00:00:59.719> nine<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.960> more

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
out probably the sensors nine one more

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.970 
out probably the sensors nine one more
box

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.500 

so<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:04.760> was<00:01:04.970> able<00:01:05.090> to<00:01:05.239> get<00:01:05.360> everything

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
so I was able to get everything

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.720 
so I was able to get everything
unwrapped<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.920> just<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.160> quick<00:01:07.340> overview

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
unwrapped it's just a quick overview

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.510 
unwrapped it's just a quick overview
everything<00:01:08.510> comes<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.170> box<00:01:09.520> paperwork

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
everything comes in the box paperwork

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
everything comes in the box paperwork
the<00:01:10.730> controller<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.830> eye<00:01:13.160> and<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
the controller you have the eye and the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.230 
the controller you have the eye and the
float<00:01:15.380> switch<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:18.020> two<00:01:18.260> magnetic<00:01:18.620> holders

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
float switch the two magnetic holders

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.570 
float switch the two magnetic holders
power<00:01:20.240> supply<00:01:20.770> another<00:01:21.770> amount<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.460> have

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
power supply another amount that I have

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390 
power supply another amount that I have
to<00:01:22.670> figure<00:01:22.910> out<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:23.300> for

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
to figure out what it's for

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.230 
to figure out what it's for
the<00:01:25.400> pump<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:27.170> line<00:01:28.150> planning<00:01:29.150> on

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
the pump and the line planning on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.840 
the pump and the line planning on
hooking<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:29.690> up<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.170> overflow<00:01:30.950> that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
hooking it up to that overflow that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.940 
hooking it up to that overflow that
sorry<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:36.650> then<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:36.979> all<00:01:37.160> go<00:01:37.690> into<00:01:38.690> there<00:01:39.140> as

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
sorry and then it all go into there as

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.320 
sorry and then it all go into there as
you<00:01:40.130> can<00:01:40.250> see<00:01:40.369> it's<00:01:40.490> only<00:01:40.729> your<00:01:40.880> tank<00:01:41.090> I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
you can see it's only your tank I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.200 
you can see it's only your tank I
haven't<00:01:41.660> gotten<00:01:41.810> anything<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.290> here<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.210> I'm

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
Vega color over there it's not even

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.690 
Vega color over there it's not even
hooked<00:01:49.550> up<00:01:49.700> yet<00:01:49.850> either<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.220> alright<00:01:52.220> I'll<00:01:52.520> get

here's<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.360> module<00:02:11.780> I'm<00:02:11.990> sorry<00:02:12.260> about<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
here's the module I'm sorry about the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.600 
here's the module I'm sorry about the
flashlight<00:02:13.160> but<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:15.230> eye<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.960> backup

shred at the water level

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.490 
shred at the water level
I'm<00:02:20.480> keeping<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.840> water<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.080> little<00:02:21.200> higher

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
I'm keeping the water a little higher

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.780 
I'm keeping the water a little higher
than<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.740> should<00:02:21.860> because<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> pumps<00:02:22.730> a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
than it should because the pumps a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.830 
than it should because the pumps a
little<00:02:22.970> high<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:24.830> gets<00:02:25.040> wired<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.840> that's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
little high just gets wired up that's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.990 
little high just gets wired up that's
where<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.080> water<00:02:27.319> comes<00:02:27.530> in

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
where the water comes in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.369 
where the water comes in
right<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.799> then<00:02:32.159> runs<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.209> here<00:02:33.480> and

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
right there and then runs up here and

right there and then runs up here and
that<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.470> all<00:02:37.709> wired<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:39.019> the
