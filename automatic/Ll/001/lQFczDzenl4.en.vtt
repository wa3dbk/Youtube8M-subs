00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.690
 30 we had to get up then stand 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.599
 with us a 500 kilometer long 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 car ride to berlin 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.990
 We also have that relatively well 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.619
 used the weather was great and so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.420
 we are then at half or half past 11 12 in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.400
 Berlin arrived 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 our hotel was in the main station unfortunately 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.220
 we could not judge yet because 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 that meant for us we are directly over 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.380
 gone to the main station there with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.730
 through the main station times a little 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.829
 have gone along now a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
 to bring trifles to eat and are 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 then drove off accordingly 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.520
 Direction dividend 2014 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.399
 Of course you asks now what is the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 dwd 2014 and that may be 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 so much to say that our youtube 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.270
 network the move one day to his 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 partner organizes workshops at which it 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.329
 make contacts and similar things 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 we have the whole we have of course 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 are then used as front runs after 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.670
 drove Berlin and have us so that it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.240
 clearly instead of looking at us 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 then made it to the 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 venue and the whole was 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.500
 in the middle of Berlin in Neukölln 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 settled there we settled in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 I think I met old theater 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.299
 and after we get to the main station 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.409

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.930
 The whole thing was nice then 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.040

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120
 We location that also who the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.760

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.069
 it first directly to the bar for it 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.900

 we do not use alcoholic drinks 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.410
 sponsored drinks from any one 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.519
 manufacturer from new york warns no 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.560
 Idea does not ask me now 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.819
 and then we had the opportunity us 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.099
 in the hall a little bit to look 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.099
 because there were stalls of sony resp 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.730
 Playstation with its portal several 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.470

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.310
 then again call of duty bus and a 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.480
 Another game we looked at completely game 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.169
 not so much control or at all 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.790
 no console 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.349
 There have to be a couple of cool times 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.260
 because I did not have that yet 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.870
 Playstation 4 controller so far in 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.489
 had the hand 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.629
 then we could again a 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.950
 little on the stalls and see 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.379
 that looked at once then 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.720
 was a stand from the ufa since they were 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.250
 altogether with a slow motion camera 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.780
 you wanted to see the background with 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.849
 high background running today times 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.500
 Do a lot of crazy things and in 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.209
 green screen was also available 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.370
 and there are some cool ones as well 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.739
 slow motion shots yahoo looking for stallion 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.109
 The one now comes with 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.040
 See the various youtube channels 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.840
 can 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.609
 it continued then or between 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.440
 program it went on then that 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 we are with a lord of youtube 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.810
 via cross promotion and youtube 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.100
 Overall, it works that tells you 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.419
 In any case very very interesting and 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.940
 then it was only short 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.680
 piano pieces in a cinema which somehow 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.830
 The company is common there 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.510
 We had an exclusive movie family 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.729

 curved canvas which is really up to date 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.590
 I do not know that for you 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.030

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.289
 cool occurs and that is the first of the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.710
 Being close is far from the band 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.810

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.880

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.830
 say these few seconds 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.830

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.420
 check in possibilities 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
 then we are also directly in bed 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.990
 gone to sleep some and in the morning 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.640
 then got up and after the breakfast 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.230

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.240

 volt gives the video just the thumb 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.900

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.610
 possibly from a trip to new york 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.900
 and the other cities of the east coast 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.610
 I'll be back soon in a few weeks 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.380
 Otherwise, it will be a short one 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.860
 rate video and we thank you for 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.860
