00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.350
 pokemon cards in exchange 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.660
 so I first want to say that in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 exchange of these pokemon cards I 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.840
 search in priority before I tell you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.859
 want to prioritize what I 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.949
 search so I search have priority 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.060
 star already the kia star because it's 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.680
 the only one I miss to have them at 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 complete and why not maybe 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.609
 other stars but really the tia star 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.130
 in priority then some old 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 ex such as nora cofex or rent their 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 decks that are cards that I like 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 really then why not want 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.950
 especially in calling people I 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 search for those who are am 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 to have them all and so here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 it's primarily going to see what I 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 Search also in booster booster 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.469

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 French boosters or another language 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 English or other is not serious people 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.199
 are looking for peace boosters that this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 are pocketbooks dexi pa of the ten 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.579
 wounds simple boosters of any 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.680
 what would it be for the ex block 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.330
 did say me loses the hearing xy 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 here I am loading of you booster 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.020
 so that's my research 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 priority 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.229
 after if you have other things to me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 propose do not hesitate 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.090
 but be aware that this is what I 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.140
 search in priority is going so I avoid and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.490
 show you some cards that are 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.220
 change them so not everything 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 so already here we do not have the chances there 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.030
 no more so just wait I just 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 find a bruce are they so his 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
 salad of finally you can propose the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.509
 land something for the cards that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.119
 are not foreign exchange but I doubt it 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.890
 strong that I'm going trading and so what 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.530
 whether I'm exchanging c or wait until 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 I'm back, so here I am already 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.070
 share so I'm trading the data from 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
 cards and jean delas who are raÃ¯kou here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.869
 that a part of the top and louviers 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.990
 part of the bottom so it interests 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.640
 someone do not hesitate to propose 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 then 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.010
 I can exchange also told them j 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.790
 kassela that one so he's still nothing 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.290
 all the wars that presented themselves 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.150
 sense in state really has a very very good 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.179
 state then what do I have still 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.560
 has therefore to the exchange to casamance judged 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.970
 almost all the stars are missing 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 just the piasse so at the box mstar that 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.500
 at aqualie celebi and metallos star 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.680
 was going to change so here are the three there 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.510
 they went to change 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.230
 after that i will still go change 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.690
 terrarium crowd arte as well as terra who 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.220
 have that ex after that maybe why 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.010
 not fulgure hoist gloria what 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.410
 I exchange after the cud and holographic 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.360
 Briefly basically it's about what I 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.380
 change hello your life makes them 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.300
 other cards that judge in case 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.860
 so these are the cards that I just 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.190
 present to you these are the ones that 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.660
 I trade first because the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.640
 men because it does not interest me 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.000
 inevitably and others I prefer them 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.010
 keep 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.230
 so for example like the ds that's it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.970
 sure she would not trade I prefer 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 keep them or why not turn so much 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.910
 that shaggy she has several doubles 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.290
 So here are the others I prefer 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 keep but if it interests someone and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.860
 which really offers something 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.480
 well 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.060
 why not that could be done here 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.860
 so listen if you have any 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.630
