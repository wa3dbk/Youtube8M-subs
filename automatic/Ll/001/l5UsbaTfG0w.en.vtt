00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.160
 I'm Edward Ferrario and I'm the author 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.760
 the interpreter of the exam series I am 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.070
 a comedian 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.350
 I started doing stand up comedy 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.449
 doing the university came to me 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.400
 the idea of ​​writing a web series 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.150
 dedicated to the world of university 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.580
 Italian 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.100
 I am a Lithium Montesi born as 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.760
 fitter and I have always been passionate about it 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.119
 of direction of the video clip who has dimension 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.010
 in short, things are matteo cappè 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.399
 codiretto examination when eduardo came 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.589
 to propose me exams or I fell for 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.969
 chair and I said let's talk maurizio e 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.409
 we do immediately 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.190
 let's say we didn't think 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.809
 exactly where to spread it ie leader 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.429
 is to actually make a 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.170
 Product issues that amuse me 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.329
 it seemed very funny that 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.999
 each dealt with a different faculty 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.589
 we say we have a little reasoned how 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.879
 say ex post ie we found each other 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.549
 we saw what we had in front of us 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.940
 then in the end we realized that 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.820
 actually the most direct way e 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.950
 fast and I have to say sensible to do it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 see would have been youtube and we have 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.060
 felt the need for example beyond 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.280
 to the joke inside the classroom to succeed that is 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.460
 to leave the classroom to study in depth 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.369
 thematic characters 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 out of the classroom just to give a 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.640
 a wider breath 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.110
 the series I started from this then 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.229
 I started from some experiences that I did 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.329
 things had happened at the exams 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.060
 above all I had heard I am 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.030
 went to them with with con's 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.619
 first drafts of screenplays and him 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.179
 made to read I saw that they laughed this 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.069
 that sara dami knows a lot about corato because 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.240
 then anyway we also say to get used to it 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:45.950
 to the relationship with the public for me is 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.509
 essential to see immediately one 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.740
 reaction if grandpa is quiet up 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.020
 this is something i am a lot 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 funny was that before work 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.360
 of the translation into images of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.000
 what was the text of exams one 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 very nice thing for me was the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.739
 moment we decided on the crew 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.329
 it was all about reading together 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.069
 all together the text in short 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.840
 transversal involvement of the whole 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.970
 crew made sure everyone did 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 affezionasse dyer inscribed sounds I give 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 hard there is a comparison with the public 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.780
 immediate is very violent if we want to 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.599
 to greet good and very bad 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.609
 olè si in the beginning we were a bit 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.359
 terrified of the idea of ​​approaching 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.819
 we said this is real 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.280
 strange shyness I think we are 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.989
 doing an interesting job 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.239
 unaware of education ie we are 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.989
 re-educating the television system in 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.459
 some way 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.440
 instead it is nice, in short, however, to see 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.500
 how the actually starts now 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.239
 the TV to look at the web 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.040
 understanding that indeed there is 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.480
 they are original and worthy products 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 this is beautiful as to say it bodes well 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 in short, there is a small revolution at 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.000
 always carries his words very much 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.000
 however large however it is
