00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.370

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.630
 greased his cooler 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.840
 the whole computer cooler is necessary not only 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.240
 brush well and occasionally lubricate 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 You can certainly go buy oh no 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.289
 so expensive 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 but you can principle it and calmly lubrication 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 we will still work and work and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.800
 work to our lubricate it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.500
 we need to remove the protective 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.820
 film 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.820
 it is better to make a stationery knife 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:51.680
 possible and a thin screwdriver now we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:01:07.020
 here we see the plug on the rubber 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:11.360
 it needs to be removed with you removed now we take 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:22.250

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:22.250
 take the oil take the usual match 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.570
 dunk in butter and that's literally a little bit straight 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
 just touch this iron one 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 here we have a roller pin 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.810
 silver iron steve eat literally 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.479
 with a cookie touch 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 and you have a little limp liver 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.180
 there is enough oil 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 literally two droplets even 2 it will be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 already a lot enough 1 drop good 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.890
 such a drop is enough for everyone and oil 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.649
 there our drops 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.130
 Now we put back our stub 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.049
 everything is corked 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 we put on a protective film for 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.080
 glue back because you are no longer 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.830

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:27.540
 electrical tape and stick here all our own 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.450
