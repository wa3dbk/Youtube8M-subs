00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
will have a servo module that will

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.640 
will have a servo module that will
attach<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.610> side<00:01:12.939> of<00:01:13.210> this<00:01:13.600> lens<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.259> this

attach to the side of this lens and this

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.910 
attach to the side of this lens and this
will<00:01:14.829> give<00:01:14.979> us<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.130> ability<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.759> work<00:01:16.240> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
will give us the ability to work in

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
and zoom demesne we're gonna go over

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.480 
and zoom demesne we're gonna go over
across<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.439> booth<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.039> check<00:01:27.280> out<00:01:27.399> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
across the booth and check out the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.029 
across the booth and check out the
module<00:01:27.819> okay<00:01:28.749> so<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:29.079> come<00:01:29.289> over<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.950> other

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
module okay so we come over to the other

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.499 
module okay so we come over to the other
section<00:01:30.429> of<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.579> Fuji<00:01:30.880> booth<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.299> just

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
section of the Fuji booth and I just

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.690 
section of the Fuji booth and I just
wanted<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.200> get<00:01:32.740> an<00:01:32.890> idea<00:01:33.249> this<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.549> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
wanted you to get an idea this is a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.910 
wanted you to get an idea this is a
mock-up<00:01:34.030> of<00:01:34.329> what<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:34.780> servo<00:01:35.289> module<00:01:35.679> would

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
mock-up of what the servo module would

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.129 
mock-up of what the servo module would
look<00:01:36.100> like<00:01:36.249> when<00:01:36.490> it's<00:01:36.670> installed<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.420> the

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
look like when it's installed and the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.440 
look like when it's installed and the
great<00:01:38.859> thing<00:01:39.039> about<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.429> module<00:01:39.639> is<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.060> if

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
great thing about this module is that if

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.450 
great thing about this module is that if
you<00:01:40.719> don't<00:01:41.499> need<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.889> then<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.039> want<00:01:42.249> to<00:01:42.310> take

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
you don't need it then you want to take

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.370 
you don't need it then you want to take
it<00:01:42.549> off<00:01:42.639> the<00:01:42.670> lens<00:01:42.939> it's<00:01:43.210> four<00:01:43.450> screws<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
it off the lens it's four screws and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.649 
it off the lens it's four screws and
this<00:01:45.249> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
this is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
this is
recalibrating<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.770> other<00:01:46.920> words<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.310> doesn't

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
recalibrating in other words it doesn't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.459 
recalibrating in other words it doesn't
require<00:01:47.880> any<00:01:48.210> special<00:01:48.539> operation<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.350> get

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
require any special operation to get

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.100 
require any special operation to get
everything<00:01:50.039> we<00:01:50.219> calibrated<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.240> working

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
everything we calibrated back working

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
everything we calibrated back working
with<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.469> servo<00:01:52.979> taking<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:53.850> putting<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
with the servo taking it off putting it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389 
with the servo taking it off putting it
back<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.289> pretty<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.799> one-stop

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
back on it's pretty much a one-stop

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
back on it's pretty much a one-stop
operation<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.720> course<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
operation and of course we have the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560 
operation and of course we have the
traditional<00:01:58.890> focus<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> Xun<00:02:00.000> demands<00:02:00.299> here

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
traditional focus and Xun demands here

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
traditional focus and Xun demands here
from<00:02:00.869> Fuji<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> mount<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
have all the LDS information that can be

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.150 
have all the LDS information that can be
