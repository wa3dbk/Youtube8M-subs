vegetables flowers and herbs which is
good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
good

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.510 
good
so<00:02:14.180> yep<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.360> got<00:02:15.569> two<00:02:15.750> bags<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.230> those<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.920> these

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
so yep I got two bags of those and these

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.880 
so yep I got two bags of those and these
are<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:19.190> eight<00:02:20.190> eight<00:02:21.060> quarts<00:02:21.599> dry<00:02:22.050> yeah

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
are actually eight eight quarts dry yeah

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.100 
are actually eight eight quarts dry yeah
besides<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.670> believe<00:02:23.940> there<00:02:24.300> were<00:02:24.390> four<00:02:24.660> twenty

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
besides I believe there were four twenty

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.559 
besides I believe there were four twenty
four<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.830> Home<00:02:26.610> Depot<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.930> got<00:02:29.569> which

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
four at Home Depot and then I got which

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.089 
four at Home Depot and then I got which
probably<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.590> thinking<00:02:31.860> about<00:02:31.920> it

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
probably now I'm thinking about it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.089 
probably now I'm thinking about it
getting<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> larger<00:02:33.480> bags<00:02:33.720> probably<00:02:34.560> costs

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
getting the larger bags probably costs

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.750 
getting the larger bags probably costs
less<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.830> been<00:02:38.069> buying<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.610> I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
less but I just kind of been buying as I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
less but I just kind of been buying as I
get<00:02:38.970> money<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.620> budget<00:02:40.800> for<00:02:41.160> my<00:02:41.250> garden

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
get money for the budget for my garden

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.190 
get money for the budget for my garden
so<00:02:41.849> that's<00:02:42.030> kind<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.269> what<00:02:42.660> I've<00:02:42.780> been<00:02:42.870> doing

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so that's kind of what I've been doing

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.509 
so that's kind of what I've been doing
and<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.640> got<00:02:44.910> two<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.480> these<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.370> they

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
and then I got two of these and they

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then I got two of these and they
have<00:02:47.549> 20<00:02:48.120> each<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.080> label

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
have 20 each and then you just label

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.270 
have 20 each and then you just label
them<00:02:49.680> stick<00:02:50.580> them<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:51.030> your<00:02:51.120> plants<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
them stick them down in your plants and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.229 
them stick them down in your plants and
honestly<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.370> probably<00:02:53.640> could<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:53.970> just

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
honestly I probably could have just

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.970 
honestly I probably could have just
bought<00:02:54.420> went<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> craft<00:02:55.470> store<00:02:55.709> I'm

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
bought went to the craft store I'm

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.550 
bought went to the craft store I'm
bought<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.510> 100<00:02:57.510> pack<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.959> popsicle<00:02:58.530> sticks

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
bought of 100 pack of popsicle sticks

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.220 
bought of 100 pack of popsicle sticks
and<00:02:59.099> it<00:02:59.250> probably<00:02:59.790> been<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.209> price<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.690> one<00:03:01.080> of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
and it probably been the price of one of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
and it probably been the price of one of
these<00:03:01.380> or<00:03:01.650> cheaper<00:03:02.069> does<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.610> Hobby<00:03:02.790> Lobby

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
these or cheaper does that Hobby Lobby

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.839 
these or cheaper does that Hobby Lobby
I'll<00:03:03.269> probably<00:03:03.480> use<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> coupon<00:03:04.819> but<00:03:05.819> I

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
I'll probably use the coupon but I

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.240 
I'll probably use the coupon but I
didn't<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.959> purchased<00:03:07.560> those<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.069> that

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
didn't I I purchased those but that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.949 
didn't I I purchased those but that
would<00:03:08.400> be<00:03:08.430> another<00:03:08.790> alternative<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.660> make<00:03:09.810> it

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
would be another alternative to make it

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.289 
would be another alternative to make it
cheaper<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.910> got<00:03:12.590> sweet<00:03:13.590> basil

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
cheaper and then I got sweet basil

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.120 
cheaper and then I got sweet basil
cilantro<00:03:16.220> dill<00:03:17.450> parsley<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.140> oregano<00:03:19.260> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
gonna be you know needing to plan a lot

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.590 
gonna be you know needing to plan a lot
to<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:38.160> what<00:03:38.400> germinates<00:03:38.880> what<00:03:39.090> doesn't<00:03:39.480> and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
to see what germinates what doesn't and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.680 
to see what germinates what doesn't and
do<00:03:39.900> them<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.109> increments<00:03:40.470> maybe<00:03:41.040> every<00:03:42.000> 10<00:03:42.359> to

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
do them in increments maybe every 10 to

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.800 
do them in increments maybe every 10 to
12<00:03:43.019> days<00:03:43.230> plant<00:03:43.739> another<00:03:44.100> set<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:45.299> can<00:03:45.569> have

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
warmer and I got the actual seed

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.250 
warmer and I got the actual seed
starting<00:03:58.739> mix<00:03:59.130> which<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.639> what<00:03:59.880> I<00:04:00.120> will<00:04:00.540> put<00:04:00.870> in

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
starting mix which is what I will put in

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.710 
starting mix which is what I will put in
you<00:04:01.950> know<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.250> container<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.940> start<00:04:03.299> my<00:04:03.450> seeds

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you know the container to start my seeds

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
you know the container to start my seeds
off<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.430> there<00:04:05.639> we<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.459> believe
