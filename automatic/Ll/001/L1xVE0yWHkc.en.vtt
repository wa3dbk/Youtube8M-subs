00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello all my and fierce welcome to the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.190
 channel one more time but first of all 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.200
 I want to remind you that if you want 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.840
 coins in a fast and secure way 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 especially cheap I leave the link to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.340
 a very reliable page next to the code 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
 that will give you 8% more coins in the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.970
 description and if you have any questions or a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.920
 problem myself the folios of art in 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 order now we do start with this new 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 video this new chapter episode like 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 he likes to call of unite for all I is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 the jonas turn of the team the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.439
 week that is currently many already what 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.329
 you know they play the valence of the bbva league 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.670
 He is Brazilian and his favorite shop is the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.860
 right we go for statistics and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.500
 first of all we see your letter with 82 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.540
 of half natural position of playmaker 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.239
 but I use it as a center forward 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.579
 rhythm of 77 84 shooting 68 of father and 86 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 of dribbling deepening a little more 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.879
 we found that he has control of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 exaggeratedly good ball since it is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.550
 92 a quite pretty completion 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.840
 but pretty good with 89 a power of 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.309
 shot 88 this is a bit 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 controversial at least for me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.450
 agility of 80 strength 62 that is a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 low and posey 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.619
 of 82 that is not bad at all has only 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.600
 three dodge stars but it has 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.880
 four bad leg have the hats 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 perfect to be an attacker since 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.229
 the attack is high and is under the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.909
 the defense its price is quite 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 accessible and until around 18 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 thousand coins today to the best already lowered 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 a little bit more and most are 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.189
 about 15 even as usual 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 in the whole review we are going to see some goals 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.210
 and it lacks a little more than I 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.039
 this player has seemed like the game is a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 bit strange because it does not finish me 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.899
 convince but it still marks me 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.429
 enough goals is super effective and the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.740
 front at the end of account for that 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.990
 they are to score goals and I do not know but I do not 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.549
 finally convince completely but yes the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 shooting is bestial because all the values 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.259
 they enter when they go with quality shot or 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.470
 of fine shot because the powerful shot is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.149
 terrible and failures at all the pace not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.729
 it's not bad at all, it even seems like a 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.319
 little bit faster sometimes 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.810
 but strength that is a problem because 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.159
 if you notice that he is very weak with another 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.569
 thing that I had mentioned now and that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.519
 you also have to stand out so that you do not 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.100
 is going to happen is the control of the ball 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.900
 because it's very weird but so weird that 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.150
 the balls bounce 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.310
 by air, it is usually controlled by a 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.409
 Perfect way skip band air tour and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.989
 the casualties without any problem and can 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.299
 prepare to shoot to pass it and make 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.799
 a danger play go now yes 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.870
 let's go to the advantages 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.209
 the first one is the kind of quality is a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.040
 What is it like, it looks like you 're in fifa 12 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.010
 before the patch do you put it on 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.780
 because of quality shooting marks all the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.939
 second the position since it is always 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 well placed to grab to grab 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.900
 all bounces or to grab 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.819
 any clearance the third is the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.379
 headshot that even if the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.329
 letter that is very little 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.299
 Jonas take many but many 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.620
 head shots thanks to its height the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.120
 last advantage had already been 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.769
 mentioned is the magnificent control of 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.150
 ball that he has because this is very 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.530
 good that is a control flat 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.480
 ball that has no ball is going 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.250
 really very well now we are going to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.290
 the disadvantages the first is the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.150
 definition but beware that here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.010
 I mean the definition with the shot 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.609
 powerful because that the truth is that if 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.609
 it's terrible it does not put any but none 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.260
 with shot so powerful none the second 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.350
 it's strength because it even seems less 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.450
 of 62 it has and it looks 50's grave 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.460
 very easy the rhythm is controversial 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 careful because I know that he had said that 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.720
 it was good even faster this can 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.580
 be a disadvantage or not do it because in 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.780
 some matches is very fast but in 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.580
 other parties is slow 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.860
 I do not understand why I do not know why 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.780
 it happened to me many times and this is something 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.880
 that is very variable the truth me that's why 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.740
 I put it as a disadvantage very well already 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.940
 Although it has its points against 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.250
 Well, he also has many points in favor 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.870
 which are very good and is a forward 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.730
 good because the forwards are for 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 scoring goals he had already said and this one 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.870
 The brand is very effective because it 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.750
 many goals all end of finished not me 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.310
 ends up convincing like that so 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.490
 that I believe that a fair rating 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.540
 it would be 8.2 the boys and they liked the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.520
