larger topic I get to just tell you what
chords<00:01:01.049> work<00:01:02.049> good<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:03.070> key<00:01:03.220> of<00:01:03.250> C<00:01:03.430> so<00:01:03.750> we

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
chords work good in the key of C so we

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.750 
chords work good in the key of C so we
got<00:01:04.900> C<00:01:05.170> which<00:01:05.500> happens<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.040> be<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.250> 1<00:01:06.460> chord

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
got C which happens to be the 1 chord

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.210 
got C which happens to be the 1 chord
and<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.540> don't<00:01:08.170> have<00:01:08.380> time<00:01:08.560> unfortunately<00:01:08.740> to

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
really get into the to the why it's all

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.280 
really get into the to the why it's all
one<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.360> everything<00:01:13.570> like<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.080> I'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
one and everything like that but I'll

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.320 
one and everything like that but I'll
just<00:01:14.320> give<00:01:15.189> you<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.460> information<00:01:16.030> for<00:01:16.180> now

just give you that information for now

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.270 
just give you that information for now
the<00:01:17.259> C<00:01:17.439> is<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.740> one<00:01:17.920> chord<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.330> then<00:01:19.840> F<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:21.039> the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
the C is the one chord and then F is the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.590 
the C is the one chord and then F is the
four<00:01:21.520> chord<00:01:22.950> G<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.219> 5<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:25.149> we've<00:01:25.299> got<00:01:25.450> one

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
four chord G is the 5 so we've got one

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.029 
four chord G is the 5 so we've got one
four<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:25.990> five<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.409> if<00:01:26.469> you<00:01:26.590> know<00:01:26.679> your<00:01:26.799> Barre

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
four and five and if you know your Barre

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.620 
four and five and if you know your Barre
chords<00:01:28.649> my<00:01:29.649> pattern<00:01:30.009> looks<00:01:30.249> like<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.700> if<00:01:31.479> we

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
chords my pattern looks like this if we

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.919 
chords my pattern looks like this if we
play<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> C<00:01:32.140> at<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.409> 8th<00:01:32.679> fret<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:34.179> then<00:01:34.600> a

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
play a C at the 8th fret and then a

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:45.660 
play a C at the 8th fret and then a
skink<00:01:35.409> bar<00:01:38.640> moved<00:01:39.640> up<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.799> incidentally<00:01:45.249> is

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
skink bar moved up which incidentally is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:56.969 
skink bar moved up which incidentally is
one<00:01:45.909> for<00:01:46.149> five<00:01:46.389> in<00:01:46.420> any<00:01:46.749> key<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:56.380> we've<00:01:56.560> got<00:01:56.710> C

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
one for five in any key so we've got C

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.789 
one for five in any key so we've got C
which<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.399> one<00:01:57.609> F<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.329> four<00:01:58.630> G's<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
which is the one F is the four G's the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.379 
which is the one F is the four G's the
five<00:02:00.039> those<00:02:00.340> are<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.609> those<00:02:00.909> are<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.119> three

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
five those are the those are the three

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.580 
five those are the those are the three

major<00:02:10.360> chords<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:12.090> nice<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.360> pattern<00:02:13.540> I

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
major chords so nice little pattern I

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.920 
major chords so nice little pattern I
like<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.020> use<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.440> also<00:02:14.800> talked<00:02:15.100> about

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
like to use and I also talked about

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.970 
like to use and I also talked about
patterns<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.440> container<00:02:17.770> scale

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
patterns a bit more in container scale

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.309 
patterns a bit more in container scale
patterns<00:02:18.340> calm<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.000> nice<00:02:19.600> pattern<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.230> to

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
patterns calm but nice pattern I like to

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.340 
patterns calm but nice pattern I like to
use<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.590> find<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> relative<00:02:21.160> minors<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.850> if<00:02:22.690> if

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
use to find the relative minors if if if

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.660 
use to find the relative minors if if if
we're<00:02:23.530> looking<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> relative<00:02:24.340> minor<00:02:24.550> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
we're looking for the relative minor of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.610 
we're looking for the relative minor of
C<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.349> down<00:02:26.500> three<00:02:26.739> frets

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
C we go down three frets

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.130 
C we go down three frets
not<00:02:28.130> counting<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.550> freighter<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.090> two<00:02:29.690> three

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
not counting the freighter on two three

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.440 
not counting the freighter on two three
go<00:02:30.920> down<00:02:31.040> three<00:02:31.280> semitones<00:02:31.610> from<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.270> note

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
go down three semitones from the note

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.080 
go down three semitones from the note
and<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.980> you'll<00:02:34.520> find<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> relative

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and that's you'll find the relative

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.410 
and that's you'll find the relative
minor<00:02:35.420> right<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.959> C<00:02:36.340> down<00:02:37.340> three<00:02:37.730> one<00:02:38.090> two

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
there's an F right right here I'm up to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.500 
there's an F right right here I'm up to
the<00:02:58.849> 13th<00:02:59.239> fret<00:02:59.560> so<00:03:00.560> an<00:03:00.620> F<00:03:00.769> there<00:03:01.299> so<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.390> go

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the 13th fret so an F there so we go

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.020 
the 13th fret so an F there so we go
down<00:03:02.690> three<00:03:03.019> one<00:03:03.350> two<00:03:03.590> three<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.819> gives

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
down three one two three and that gives

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.570 
down three one two three and that gives
us<00:03:05.180> D<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.810> D<00:03:06.019> minor<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.799> relative<00:03:07.220> minor<00:03:07.370> of

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.830 
us D so D minor is the relative minor of
F<00:03:07.910> major<00:03:08.390> okay<00:03:09.350> now<00:03:10.160> with<00:03:10.370> G<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:11.299> can<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.690> G

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
F major okay now with G we can do it G

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.820 
F major okay now with G we can do it G
