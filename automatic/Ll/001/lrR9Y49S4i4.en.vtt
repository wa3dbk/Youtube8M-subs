00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you're going to do and so the key move

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.270 
you're going to do and so the key move
there<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.569> tap<00:02:10.170> cross<00:02:10.860> correct<00:02:11.790> okay<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.740> tap

count on the ten and they're going to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.860 
count on the ten and they're going to
cross<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> five<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.510> one<00:02:48.660> more<00:02:48.840> time

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
cross that on the five so one more time

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.170 
cross that on the five so one more time
it<00:02:49.800> goes<00:02:50.010> stationary<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.060> two<00:02:51.720> three<00:02:52.709> tap<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
it goes stationary one two three tap you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.070 
it goes stationary one two three tap you
begin<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.569> pull<00:02:54.780> here<00:02:55.019> as<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.260> crook<00:02:55.560> five<00:02:56.190> six

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
begin to pull here as you crook five six

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.280 
begin to pull here as you crook five six
seven<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.970> also<00:02:59.970> notice<00:03:00.420> Gaby<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.080> when

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
seven I also notice Gaby that when

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.550 
seven I also notice Gaby that when
you're<00:03:01.500> both<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.340> are<00:03:02.430> rotating<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.660> both

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you're both of you are rotating you both

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160 
you're both of you are rotating you both
of<00:03:04.830> yours<00:03:05.130> knees<00:03:05.489> are<00:03:05.790> bent<00:03:06.180> slightly<00:03:06.480> why<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
of yours knees are bent slightly why is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.319 
of yours knees are bent slightly why is
that<00:03:07.310> exactly<00:03:08.310> most<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.090> whenever

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
that exactly most of the time whenever

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.180 
that exactly most of the time whenever
we're<00:03:09.660> doing<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.320> sort<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.890> slingshot

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
we're doing this is sort of a slingshot

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.880 
we're doing this is sort of a slingshot
move<00:03:11.610> that's<00:03:11.880> determined<00:03:12.480> by<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.380> landscapes

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
move that's determined by the landscapes

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.949 
move that's determined by the landscapes
but<00:03:14.610> whenever<00:03:14.910> we're<00:03:15.269> doing<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.720> we're

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
but whenever we're doing that we're

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.300 
but whenever we're doing that we're
dropping<00:03:16.110> down<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.620> resisting<00:03:17.040> each<00:03:17.130> other

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
dropping down and resisting each other

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.180 
dropping down and resisting each other
opposite<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.329> we're<00:03:18.510> sort<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.750> making

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
opposite so we're sort of making

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.860 
opposite so we're sort of making
resistance<00:03:20.190> here<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:20.519> top<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.390> hands

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
resistance here on top and on the hands

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.680 
resistance here on top and on the hands
so<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.530> we're<00:03:23.040> doing<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.400> step<00:03:23.670> bending<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
so as we're doing the step bending the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.060 
so as we're doing the step bending the
knees<00:03:24.840> actually<00:03:25.200> allows<00:03:25.410> us<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.620> simply

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
knees actually allows us to simply

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.460 
knees actually allows us to simply
slingshot<00:03:26.549> when<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.820> have<00:03:27.030> facing<00:03:27.420> one<00:03:27.660> two

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
slingshot when we do have facing one two

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.100 
slingshot when we do have facing one two
three<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.640> when<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:29.850> tap<00:03:30.120> our<00:03:30.390> knees<00:03:30.660> are<00:03:30.810> bent

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
three and when we tap our knees are bent

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.900 
three and when we tap our knees are bent
because<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.709> pulling<00:03:32.100> here<00:03:32.340> she's<00:03:32.579> pulling

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
because I'm pulling here she's pulling

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.910 
because I'm pulling here she's pulling
back<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.239> well<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.140> we're<00:03:34.320> slingshotting

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
back as well and we're slingshotting

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
back as well and we're slingshotting
into<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.370> five<00:03:36.239> six<00:03:37.079> seven<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.220> then<00:03:38.730> we<00:03:38.820> get

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
into it five six seven and then we get

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.340 
into it five six seven and then we get
that<00:03:39.150> total<00:03:39.630> position

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
that total position

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.130 
that total position
very<00:03:40.920> good<00:03:41.130> can<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.459> do<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.760> simultaneous<00:03:42.690> now

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
very good can you do a simultaneous now

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.009 
very good can you do a simultaneous now
with<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> basic<00:03:43.799> step<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.660> it's<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:45.870> going

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
with a basic step and it's just going

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.720 
with a basic step and it's just going
through<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> first<00:03:46.650> hook<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.160> front<00:03:47.459> on

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
through the first hook in the front on

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.220 
through the first hook in the front on
the<00:03:47.790> first<00:03:48.269> day<00:03:48.390> account<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:48.989> we'll<00:03:49.109> do

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the first day account and then we'll do

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.050 
the first day account and then we'll do
a<00:03:49.260> hook<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.680> back<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.100> sex<00:03:50.340> sounds<00:03:50.730> kit

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
a hook in the back on the sex sounds kit

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.240 
a hook in the back on the sex sounds kit
so<00:03:51.450> we're<00:03:51.570> going<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.720> go<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.709> two

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
so we're going to go one two

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.890 
so we're going to go one two
four<00:03:54.790> five<00:03:55.510> six<00:03:56.170> seven<00:03:57.100> eight<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.820> two<00:03:58.510> three
