00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.799
 Hello, friends, how are you? I'm nothing. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 cristian welcome to this new video 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.770
 today I would like to share a little of my 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.629
 experience when the server 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.190
 Latin America I would like to say is that 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.930
 has made much progress in terms of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.400
 community since I remember when it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.439
 they opened the servers and it was full 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.200
 of pieces planners the typical child rat 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.730
 finally and if right now you have noticed that 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.590
 same people begin to take the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.600
 game a little more seriously are more 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.329
 positive during games and try 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.579
 of helping each other in terms of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 qualifiers goes the same people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.480
 they try a little more no matter if the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.309
 game had a bad start no longer seek 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.780
 surrender for the 20th minute as before 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.870
 they did and now they became more 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 patients and try to get the game 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 sincerely I am very pleased that the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 same community is improving and they take 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 things a little more seriously but for 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 otherwise, everything is not rosy 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.429
 if you are with 30% of those that I have had 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.539
 they have touched people that seems to be 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.399
 they have fun of spoiling the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 departure to others are people who 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.699
 they start insulting their classmates 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.799
 first mistake they make and they're just 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 worked every time they can how 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.280
 they enjoy giving themselves 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.350
 people these insults are going up from 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 conformable tone is happening and little by little 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.890
 with each other they are throwing earth 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.510
 to the point that everything is going chaos 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 it's a moment you know that the game is already 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 He sucked headlights also I had to see 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.900
 people who get angry if it does not make them 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.979
 younger angel you can item 5 and if you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.050
 not the great ones so when they give it to you 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 they demand because even that is demanded of you 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.830
 they get angry and they start to flame and even worse 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.030
 if they came to kill them once because 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 with once they have killed them 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.390
 they begin to say that he is a friend is faith 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.340
 that is never going to help that they are going to go to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 sin they start insulting and just 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 they get trolls all because they died 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.800
 once online but hey I 'm not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 generalizing I'm just 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.490
 commenting that just as there are good things 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 there will be bad things and little by little the bad 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.670
 will be left in a minority and there will be a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.289
 greater number of people contributing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.869
 something positive inside the players 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.039
 Latin Americans the truth this right now 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.539

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.399
 Latin America will continue to be my account 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.619
 secondary but still it happened very good 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.660

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.070
