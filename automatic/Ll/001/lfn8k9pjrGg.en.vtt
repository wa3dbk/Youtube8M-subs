00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.340
 these scenes are just here to see 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.239
 many players are employed one 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.390
 long time 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.510
 They are from the years 2009 and 2010 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.760
 as dallas guardian first public 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.250
 was presented and directly many fans 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.620
 and not just because the cats 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.719
 bird cuddly fi looks so cute 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.120
 but because you immediately the typical 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.640
 flair of a game of team ico recognizes 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.739
 bike or shadow of the colossus knows 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.229
 Immediately one looks like one again 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.580
 explored mysterious world and how to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.890
 again the interplay of two 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.409
 characters in unusual manner quite 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.300
 the last guardian experiences without dialogue 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.429
 Actually, it seemed like a great one 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 combination of ico and shadow of the 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.569
 colossus secured himself accordingly 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 swiftly a fanbase and 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.280
 then said goodbye to the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.350
 There was no development envelope until 2015 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.340
 again a real sign of life from the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.170
 last guardian 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 Of course, that's not the case anymore 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.399
 for the playstation 3 but for the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.380
 Playstation 4 is planned otherwise 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.590
 but apparently not that much 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.590
 changed 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.150
 it is still about a young boy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.150
 to be together with the color 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.280
 Trakkov through mysterious battles where 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.869
 The hero couple landed there 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 we do not know the boy should 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.399
 but were kidnapped and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.649
 Traikov is also being held prisoner 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.320
 the hosts are too friendly 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.479
 probably not the host by the way the im 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.970
 current trailer does not show up 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.869
 in this older video of 2009 always 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 you can see 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.810
 The sneaking around of opponents was added 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.180
 the e3 2015 not shown but probably 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.459
 continue to play belong to the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.380
 marco should be strong enough to deal with 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.030
 to be able to invest the slave too 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.769
 So it's likely to be 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.500
 not only sneaked but 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.060
 occasionally also fought 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.819
 Of course, the focus is on the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.760
 relationship of the hero duo to each other and 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.290
 as usual , the developers are all around 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.269
 Do not rent this relationship 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.269
 with many words to stage 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.630
 Above all, they are the usual grandiose ones 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.550
 animations the boys and traikk 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.740
 not only to create a virtual life 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.260
 but also the interaction of the 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.600
 Both put in scene my clumsy 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130
 sometimes panic but always together 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.370
 the two on the way and master 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.840
 different challenges 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.370
 the development team goes with it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.800
 apparently also sparingly with 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.330
 interface elements around even if im 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.340
 probably play a few 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.470
 show more appear than in the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.540
 shown game scenes the important 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.220
 Information is provided when 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.470
 Trakkov for example this 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.690
 dream catcher windrad links spotted and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.970
 with red glowing eyes nervous and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 anxiously backs away then we knew 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.900
 Although damn why his eyes damn 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.000
 red light what makes this pinwheel 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.370
 in this kind of puzzles appears more often 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.680
 but so many ask 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.970
 let the scenes shown are open 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.310
 Immediately realize that we are the object 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.200
 have to clear up to continue with the jersey 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.750
 come 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280
 the last guardian is not supposed to 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.709
 just look pretty but also 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.420
 playfully demand it when 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.129
 The boy failed after jerseys 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.440
 snap try for example on 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.269
 tail of the fable must hold on 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.280
 then that is according to the developer statement 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.170
 no self-running inter-sequence 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.760
 the player has to hold on to that 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.890
 trigger the right moment 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.170
 in earlier demonstrations were too 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.729
 to see persistence when the 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.500
 Boy in this sequence at Trankov 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.389
 So he can possibly hold on to that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.340
 do not do anything indefinitely 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.260
 Apart from that, there should be some time 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.700
 pass until the snaps ever on 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.290
 Giant can hold 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.630
 the two should start playing 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.940
 namely, first have to make friends 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 besides, traikov should not be exclusive 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.169
 act as a script or follow orders 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.870
 but supported by a ki 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.460
 certainly his own head have a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.410
 According to sony statement, the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.510
 presentation at this year's e3 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.460
 therefore played no live 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.160
 jerseys behavior is simply too 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.320
 unpredictable it said that the bird 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.810
 cat is really so headstrong 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.490
 may well be doubted cautious 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.260
 would Traikov in hot situations 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.450
 suddenly any cooperation 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.220
 that would probably be right 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.160
 Quickly just frustrating though 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.330
 even minor variations in behavior 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.610
 would already be for positive 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.840
 take turns and talk with 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.840
 worry about other players 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.419
 a taste on the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.400
 between the two 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.120
 it in these scenes from an older one 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.919
 Video 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.840
 it actually looks like you have to 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.940
 Trajkow first to escape from his 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.919
 motivate and engage in captivity 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.620
 role of the ion win its trust 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.990
 and that is exactly how they grow together 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.419
 characters staged in the typical 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.820
 kind of fumito ueda made dallas 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.919
 Guardian in the best case to a great 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.229
 experience that significantly with a 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.240
 other gear from the many current ones 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.780
 play action fireworks in others 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.780
 dependent 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.059
 it does not matter that last 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.369
 guardian in 2015 not technically 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:58.189
 looks up to date and more like a 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.749
 hd new edition works who brave so far 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.899
 has been waiting for this game 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.899
 bravely expects to continue until the year 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:04.899
 2006
