00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 now 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.570
 how about friends of autocosmos.com and 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.820
 name is hector mañón and today we are 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.250
 Trying the best of 2014 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.530
 this selection of the best cars that 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.720
 they arrived in 2014 or good we have 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.700
 opportunity to drive in this year today 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.279
 I'm going to make envy probably of 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.930
 many, I have the key to this 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.859
 little toy that we have here behind 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.929
 us the ferrari 458 spider this is 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.050
 the convertible or convertible version 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.350
 of 458 italy and it is the first vehicle 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.390
 that makes ferrari with a retractable tone and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 has the central engine the car is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.690
 truly a show is very very 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.670
 very nice is it has all this language 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.780
 of new design of ferrari that has the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.760
 ff or even the new the ferrari that by 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.949
 true is going to arrive next year as 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.620
 part of the new technology that is 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.590
 bringing ferrari is this aerodynamics 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.570
 active that comes from the technology that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.690
 also not used in ferrari formula one 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.390
 and well on the front we have these 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.819
 ailerons that are modified are changing 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.360
 of angle depending on the speed of 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.300
 the one that travels 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.760
 helps us to have a downforce that 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.850
 stabilizes the vehicle but also without 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.700
 have this aerodynamic drag that 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.940
 would brake the vehicle the 458 spider is 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 based on the 458 italy and good has 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.850
 this ability to lose the awning with 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 press a button in just 14 seconds 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.120
 let's move from a coupe to a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.400
 convertible and that has exactly the 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.400
 Same features as the coupe version 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.080
 well then let's see how 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.080
 also this ferrari 458 spider 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.540
 Wow 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.510
 to incredible point 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.140
 well then back we have 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.430
 right behind me we have a v8 of 4.5 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.370
 liters that delivers nothing more and nothing less 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.990
 that five hundred and sixty-two horses and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.870
 we also have a torque of three hundred 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.660
 eighty-nine foot pounds that is the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 really pretty good and good the engine 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.340
 turns until nine thousand revolutions 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.090
 and we can do that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.569
 oh how fun is this there was never 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.569
 managed in ferrari 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 the address is really very accurate 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.760
 super precise 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 change direction 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.599
 very fast this 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.769
 it's practically telepathic maybe 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.769
 mediocre or pavement 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.170
 and good the transmission is very fast 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.970
 we have a double transmission 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:16.170
 clutch the first that Ferrari does 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.250
 seven-speed thanks to that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.250
 we have an acceleration 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.620
 from 0 to 100 of 3 points 2 seconds is 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.620
 very fast this car 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.610
 and we have a velocity that is less than 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.910
 the one from 458 italy 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.150
 because nothing else reaches 320 kilometers 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.150
 hour 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.260
 wow that sound is amazing 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.549
 Sound 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.549
 they had to change the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.549
 silencers 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.650
 but it's also not that impressive 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.490
 I had to change because the mufflers 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.490
 Ferrari reads 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.700
 Ferrari was worried that 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.760
 lose the awning 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.120
 the turbulence will affect the experience 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.200
 of the sound of the v8 I think what 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.200
 they did quite well and the noise is 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200
 Awesome 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.270
 the changes are very fast 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.320
 we have here some little lights in the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.950
 steering wheel 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.430
 that help us know when to change 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.430
 speed 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.070
 here also in the steering wheel we have all 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.070
 the functions 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.090
 we have the directionals that is 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.090
 quite strange 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.240
 we also have manettino here 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.720
 which tells us that we are in mode right now 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.440
 race we have a web mode that we say that 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.330
 it is much more intrusive the 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.360
 electronic aids we also have the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.819
 sport mode 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.819
 and we can turn off everything 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.990
 incredible the balance of this car 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.120
 this is the first central engine car 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.240
 with 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.669
 with a retractable hard awning that 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.040
 we said good is really very very 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.040
 lightweight weighs just 25 kilograms 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.030
 means that this awning that is 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:21.479
 aluminum weighs even less than an awning 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:27.260
 of canvas with everything and the mechanism then 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:31.330
 we have exactly the same acceleration 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.330
 Ferrari 458 Italy 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.130
 pity that this track is so small 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.539
 because this car goes flying it's 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:49.120
 awesome is awesome never 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:53.250
 I had driven a Ferrari and what a go 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.250
 awesome is this amazing
