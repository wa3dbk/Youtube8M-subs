00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello I'll introduce the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.080
 new lapierre and this title she 2014 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 it's a bike that comes to be located in 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.139
 the range between the xe air of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 cross-country in 100 mm and esteem 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 anton in 150 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's a bike that at 120 mm 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.740
 deflection at the back and front and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.240
 who has wheels in 29 inches it's a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 bike that is extremely versatile is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 extremely playful at the level of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 construction 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 we built the frame around 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 our western suspension system and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 plus which is a patented system by the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.290
 stone which is a system of points of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.719
 virtual pivot whose characteristic 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.730
 main thing is to have the effort to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 pedaling against pumping constantly 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.610
 which makes the bike extremely nervous 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.289
 and who has absolutely no pumping at 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 level of construction also we 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.710
 wanted to have a bike that was at the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.469
 times balanced for 29 wheels 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.809
 inches an extremely stiff bike and a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.390
 bike that is very very easy to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.399
 maintain for the for the user 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 we come to rigidities that are 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 far superior to what we 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 knew until now until 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.409
 28% more rigidity in the area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.790
 bottom bracket at the level of the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 geometry we have an angle of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 direction of 60 9 degrees which is a 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.759
 angle that makes the bike extremely 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.860
 manageable stability being brought by 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.439
 the big wheels for the tube angle 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 saddle we have an angle of 74 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.460
 degrees which is absolutely perfect 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 for the pedaling effort at the level of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.579
 construction 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 we have several platforms of 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.909
 frameworks we have platforms that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.310
 make themselves carbon others who are in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 supreme aluminum 6 anyway 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.979
 and whatever the level of range for 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.869
 reliability 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.970
 we have the basics that are 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 systematically in supreme alloy if 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.689
 what is an alloy that is ours 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 magic alloy that allows us to be at 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 both more reliable and lighter than 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 other aluminum alloys 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.670
 commonly used in the market it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.229
 must also know that all 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 settings all damper settings 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.979
 were made by nico vouilloz 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.049
 we wanted a suspension that was 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.299
 relatively efficient and relatively 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.090
 firm to have a good return on the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.860
 bike here I hope you'll take 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 a lot of fun to ride on the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.690
 festitrail 2014 thank you
