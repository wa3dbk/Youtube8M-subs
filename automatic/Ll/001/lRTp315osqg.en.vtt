missions and yet anything extra just

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.900 
missions and yet anything extra just
sprinted<00:02:21.900> through<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.079> story<00:02:22.489> as<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.700> could

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
sprinted through the story as I could

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.350 
sprinted through the story as I could
and<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.209> was<00:02:24.239> still<00:02:24.599> extremely<00:02:24.959> long<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.620> now

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
and it was still extremely long so now

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.460 
and it was still extremely long so now
I'm<00:02:27.360> gonna<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.989> third<00:02:28.230> time

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I'm gonna have to be just a third time

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.309 
I'm gonna have to be just a third time
and<00:02:29.720> not<00:02:30.720> gonna<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.019> that

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
and not gonna do that

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.319 
and not gonna do that
I<00:02:31.349> did<00:02:31.739> some<00:02:31.920> research<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.610> found<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
I did some research and I found out that

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.020 
I did some research and I found out that
the<00:02:33.480> reason<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:33.870> happens<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.730> when<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.819> play

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the reason this happens is when you play

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.039 
the reason this happens is when you play
online<00:02:36.299> tailing<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:38.430> die<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.690> online

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
online tailing you die and online

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.819 
online tailing you die and online
tailing<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.549> happens<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
tailing that's when it happens but the

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.129 
tailing that's when it happens but the
weird<00:02:44.040> thing<00:02:44.069> about<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.790> first<00:02:45.780> time<00:02:46.079> I

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
weird thing about this is first time I

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.590 
weird thing about this is first time I
did<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.980> died<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.790> online<00:02:48.030> telling<00:02:48.510> and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
did it I died in online telling and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840 
did it I died in online telling and
that's<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:48.900> caused<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.319> first<00:02:49.500> time<00:02:49.850> all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
that's what caused it the first time all

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.190 
that's what caused it the first time all
right<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.299> gonna<00:02:51.420> make<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.630> new<00:02:51.780> game<00:02:51.989> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
right I'm just gonna make a new game and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
right I'm just gonna make a new game and
never<00:02:52.410> play<00:02:52.590> online<00:02:52.769> telling<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.310> shouldn't

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
never play online telling you shouldn't

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.509 
never play online telling you shouldn't
have<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> worry<00:02:54.239> about<00:02:54.329> it

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
have to worry about it

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.009 
have to worry about it
guess<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.359> happens<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.870> online

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
guess what it happens in the online

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.979 
guess what it happens in the online
hacking<00:02:58.440> too

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.300 

maybe<00:03:01.989> can<00:03:02.200> happen<00:03:02.439> in<00:03:02.560> decryption<00:03:02.980> maybe

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
maybe can happen in decryption maybe

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.920 
maybe can happen in decryption maybe
free<00:03:03.609> room<00:03:03.760> maybe<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:04.480> could<00:03:04.569> happen<00:03:04.840> in

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
free room maybe it could happen in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.410 
free room maybe it could happen in
freaking<00:03:05.260> mobile<00:03:05.680> challenge<00:03:06.129> or<00:03:06.310> racing<00:03:07.739> like

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
can play online but it could still

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.030 
can play online but it could still

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
happen where your game gets

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.399 
happen where your game gets
automatically<00:04:41.800> reset<00:04:42.900> well<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.050> can't<00:04:44.289> do

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
automatically reset well you can't do

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.020

no<00:04:48.280> sense

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
no sense

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.170 
no sense
like<00:04:48.880> how<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.060> they<00:04:49.210> even<00:04:49.240> possible

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.840 

geomatics<00:04:53.180> pretty<00:04:53.510> much<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:54.760> hopefully<00:04:55.760> they

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
geomatics pretty much it hopefully they

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.580 
geomatics pretty much it hopefully they
fix<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:56.630> don't<00:04:56.750> think<00:04:56.840> they<00:04:56.960> can<00:04:57.170> fix<00:04:57.380> it

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590

fix it but I don't think they can fix it
like<00:04:58.520> even<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:58.970> they<00:04:59.090> do<00:04:59.150> fix<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.110> where

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
like even if they do fix it to where

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.840 
like even if they do fix it to where
won't<00:05:01.820> happen<00:05:02.030> again<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.930> other<00:05:03.110> players
