 reached 70 and 100 centimeters 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.279
 therefore it was difficult to build roads and 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.069
 quickly move troops 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.179

 the gorge is 100 150 kilometers straight in 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:44.249
 snow corridor 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.429
 experience of military road builders in conditions 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:47.950
 snowy winter showed 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.629
 what is least needed 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.399
 use old roads 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.319
 best for laying a new threshold 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.729
 resembled a flat field 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.299
 they won the shortest 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.839
 direction and with the help of the simplest 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.419
 road equipment drug on horse

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.240
 strip with traveling at the same time on both 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.470
 the sides of the road towered snow 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.599

 visibility from the air on the tracks 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.840
 possible strike of tank units 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.650
 the enemy created the forest 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.700
 brigade debris of five to seven people 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.999
 located in the forest at a distance of five 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.360
 six seven ten meters apart 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.230
 or other pines gives the side of the possible 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.730
 movements of enemy tanks 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.970
 formed anti-tank and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.939
 anti-personnel obstacles help 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.619
 total length of forest debris 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:37.129
 created on site 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.629
 Moscow region 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.780

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.590
 and everything 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.919
 Thousands of 366 point 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.899
 nine-tenths of kilometers on total 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.919
