from our previous lesson that in order
to<00:02:06.270> ensure<00:02:06.479> we're<00:02:06.899> playing<00:02:07.140> our<00:02:07.319> piano

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
to ensure we're playing our piano

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.190 
to ensure we're playing our piano
exercises<00:02:08.280> correctly<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:09.539> gave<00:02:09.720> each<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.959> our

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
exercises correctly we gave each of our

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.010 
exercises correctly we gave each of our
fingers<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> number<00:02:11.420> now<00:02:12.420> although<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
fingers a number now although the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.600 
fingers a number now although the
numbering<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.650> our<00:02:13.770> left<00:02:14.040> fingers<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
numbering for our left fingers is

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.369 
numbering for our left fingers is
exactly<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> same<00:02:15.569> as<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.020> our<00:02:16.170> right

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
exactly the same as for our right

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.650 
exactly the same as for our right
fingers<00:02:16.830> you'll<00:02:17.640> see<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.030> second<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.540> when

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
fingers you'll see in a second that when

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.869 
fingers you'll see in a second that when
we<00:02:18.780> use<00:02:18.989> our<00:02:19.230> left<00:02:19.410> hand<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.980> play<00:02:20.010> exercises

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
we use our left hand to play exercises

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.330 
we use our left hand to play exercises
we<00:02:21.150> originally<00:02:21.569> play<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.959> our<00:02:22.080> right<00:02:22.260> hand

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we originally play with our right hand

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.470 
we originally play with our right hand
the<00:02:23.340> numbering<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.849> actually<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.390> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the numbering is actually going to be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.720 
the numbering is actually going to be
reversed

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
reversed

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.220 
reversed
so<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.060> recap<00:02:27.209> whether<00:02:27.870> we're<00:02:28.050> talking

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
so just to recap whether we're talking

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.520 
so just to recap whether we're talking
about<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> left<00:02:29.129> or<00:02:29.400> right<00:02:29.790> hand<00:02:30.090> our<00:02:30.530> thumb

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
about the left or right hand our thumb

keyboard let's find little C again
remember<00:02:52.230> middle<00:02:52.530> C<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.770> where<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.190> would

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
remember middle C is where we would

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.000 
remember middle C is where we would
normally<00:02:53.400> place<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:54.660> thumb<00:02:54.960> but<00:02:55.860> now

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
normally place our right thumb but now

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.770 
normally place our right thumb but now
because<00:02:56.250> we're<00:02:56.610> introducing<00:02:57.180> our<00:02:57.330> left<00:02:57.540> hand

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
because we're introducing our left hand

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
pattern we first played in our previous

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.330 
pattern we first played in our previous
lesson<00:04:17.600> but<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.750> time<00:04:19.040> notice<00:04:20.040> how<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
lesson but this time notice how the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.009 
lesson but this time notice how the
numbering<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.090> exercise<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.900> now

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.790 
left hand now instead of our right now
before<00:04:27.210> we<00:04:27.300> begin<00:04:27.570> let's<00:04:28.290> make<00:04:28.530> sure<00:04:28.560> our

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
before we begin let's make sure our

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.890 
before we begin let's make sure our
fingers<00:04:29.190> are<00:04:29.340> curved<00:04:29.669> our<00:04:29.880> wrist<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.510> up<00:04:30.690> and
