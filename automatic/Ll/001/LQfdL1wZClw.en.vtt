00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that it came with a lot of water in a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
that it came with a lot of water in a
short<00:01:25.439> amount<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.070> flowing<00:01:26.820> fast

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
short amount of time just flowing fast

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.940 
short amount of time just flowing fast
they<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.540> abandon<00:01:27.930> everything<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think caused all the erosion that's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
think caused all the erosion that's
taking<00:01:32.610> place<00:01:32.640> behind<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
taking place behind you do you think it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
taking place behind you do you think it
was<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> amount<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> time<00:01:35.100> or<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> amount<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
was the amount of time or the amount of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
was the amount of time or the amount of
water

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
water

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.109 
water

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
take to erode away how long did that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.240 
take to erode away how long did that
take

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this erosion was the amount of time or

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
this erosion was the amount of time or
the<00:01:56.670> amount<00:01:56.819> of<00:01:57.000> water<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.600> caused<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the amount of water that caused it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
the amount of water that caused it
I<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:59.189> give<00:01:59.310> water<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.209> haven't<00:02:00.450> never<00:02:00.569> we'd

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I can give water we haven't never we'd

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.949 
I can give water we haven't never we'd
never<00:02:00.929> seen<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.289> much<00:02:01.920> water<00:02:02.100> ever<00:02:02.399> oh<00:02:02.959> yeah

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959

never seen this much water ever oh yeah
or<00:02:04.170> both<00:02:04.850> how<00:02:05.850> long<00:02:06.060> did<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.329> take<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.630> road

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
or both how long did it take to road

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.770 
or both how long did it take to road
this<00:02:06.959> street<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:08.000> last<00:02:09.000> night<00:02:10.549> so<00:02:11.599> let<00:02:12.599> me<00:02:12.630> ask

this street out last night so let me ask
you<00:02:12.930> again<00:02:12.989> was<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.500> amount<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.739> time<00:02:13.829> or

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you again was it the amount of time or

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.589 
you again was it the amount of time or
was<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.610> amount<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.880> water<00:02:15.180> what<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
was it the amount of water what do you

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.930 
was it the amount of water what do you
think<00:02:15.780> probably<00:02:16.230> definitely<00:02:16.709> mental<00:02:16.920> water

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.850 

I<00:02:25.940> believe<00:02:26.940> he's<00:02:27.090> had<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.269> lot<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.440> rain<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.709> lot

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
I believe he's had a lot of rain a lot

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
I believe he's had a lot of rain a lot
of<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> little<00:02:29.430> water<00:02:29.640> coming<00:02:30.030> down<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.690> was

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
of a little water coming down it was

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.559 
of a little water coming down it was
like<00:02:30.989> full<00:02:31.470> nineteen<00:02:32.130> been<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> ever

Canyon and things before oh really
yeah<00:02:40.170> well<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:40.829> why<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:41.519> in

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
yeah well that's why it not here in

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.920 
yeah well that's why it not here in
Pensacola<00:02:41.879> never<00:02:42.239> seen<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.569> quite<00:02:42.780> an

Pensacola never seen it's quite an
erosion<00:02:43.350> feature<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.889> what<00:02:44.609> do<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.700> think

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
erosion feature is what do you think

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.819 
erosion feature is what do you think
cause<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.569> at<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> amount<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.170> water<00:02:46.709> a

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
cause this is at the amount of water a

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.220 
cause this is at the amount of water a
time<00:02:47.130> or<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.579> muscle<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.209> clear<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.989> is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
time or what muscle it's clear it is

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.020 
time or what muscle it's clear it is

took<00:02:58.200> millions<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.680> years<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:59.190> mean<00:02:59.459> it's<00:02:59.790> clear

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
took millions of years I mean it's clear

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.460 
took millions of years I mean it's clear
to<00:03:00.120> me<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.420> was<00:03:00.600> driving<00:03:01.019> down<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.260> road

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
to me I was driving down this road

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.020 
to me I was driving down this road
yesterday<00:03:01.889> there<00:03:02.400> was<00:03:02.489> nothing

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
yesterday there was nothing

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.030 
yesterday there was nothing
it's<00:03:04.450> gone<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.350> took<00:03:05.530> millions<00:03:05.710> of<00:03:05.980> years

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
it's gone so it took millions of years

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's gone so it took millions of years
no<00:03:06.490> you're<00:03:07.120> sure<00:03:07.150> about<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:07.930> 100%<00:03:08.350> sure

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
no you're sure about that I'm 100% sure

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.830 
no you're sure about that I'm 100% sure
it<00:03:09.070> had<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.520> event<00:03:09.820> so<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.240> evidence<00:03:10.570> is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
it had to event so the evidence is

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.550 
it had to event so the evidence is
incredibly<00:03:11.470> clear<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:14.290> evidence

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
incredibly clear to you the the evidence

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.380 
incredibly clear to you the the evidence
is<00:03:14.830> irrelevant<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.460> believe<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.270> took

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
is irrelevant I believe that it took

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720 
is irrelevant I believe that it took
millions<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.810> years<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.320> may<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.340> driven<00:03:18.520> on

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
millions of years I may have driven on

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.400 
millions of years I may have driven on
here<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> few<00:03:19.180> days<00:03:19.330> ago<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.810> I'm<00:03:19.960> telling<00:03:20.290> you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.630 
here a few days ago but I'm telling you
it<00:03:20.709> took<00:03:20.920> millions<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.340> years<00:03:21.400> they<00:03:21.760> had<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
it took millions of years they had to it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.390 
it took millions of years they had to it
was<00:03:24.640> not<00:03:24.820> doubt<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.150> my<00:03:25.240> mind<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:27.160> learn

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
was not doubt in my mind so you learn

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
was not doubt in my mind so you learn
anything<00:03:27.640> about<00:03:27.910> some<00:03:28.270> moving<00:03:28.540> water

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
anything about some moving water

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.160 
anything about some moving water
it<00:03:29.620> destroys<00:03:30.100> anything<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:34.360> obvious<00:03:35.020> to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it destroys anything it's obvious to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.380 
it destroys anything it's obvious to
anyone<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.040> erosion<00:03:36.610> was<00:03:36.760> caused<00:03:37.120> not
