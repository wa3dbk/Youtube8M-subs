Hello, today my story is called : Fed by a raven !

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.660
It was an icy cold December

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.420
and the streets of the town were covered with snow. It was really cold.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.060
In a small basement room, a widow and her three children were crying

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.460
around a table with no food on it.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.540
At this time of year, where most families were making festive preparations and children

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
could be heard singing songs in anticipation of the festivities to come,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.820
There was only sadness and nothing to eat.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.060
However the Lord knew this deep distress, and wanted to manifest once more his Grace,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780
by answering their prayer of faith.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.260
- Mother!” the eldest child suddenly exclaimed,
Haven’t you read in the Bible

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.240
about the prophet Eli

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.100
who was fed by a raven that God 
sent carrying bread and meat?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.440
Well !And what if I ask God to send us a raven tonight to feed us, would he make it?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.260
The mother who didn’t have much faith right then, replied hesitantly,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.700
- Well! Yes, sure, if you believe strongly enough!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.240
The little boy went into his bedroom, knelt down by his bed and prayed,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.400
- Lord Jesus, please send us a raven tonight, like you did for the Prophet Eli,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.540
to bring us some food.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520
I ask this in your name, Lord Jesus, Amen."

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.160
Amen. Thank you Jesus !

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.760
Then, the boy came back really happy, kissing his mother on the cheek and telling him not to cry anymore!

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.620
He opened widely the front door and stood up
 in front of her,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.320
his arms were crossed and full of hope he was looking at the sky waiting for his prayer to be answered.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.400
It was 10 o’clock at night and the street was empty.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.440
Finally, the sound of footsteps was heard and a well-dressed man appeared at the end of the street.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.600
As he saw the front door open and the little boy standing on the doorstep, the man stopped,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.180
glanced inside of the room where 
he saw a small lamp burning

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.560
and asked what he was doing there?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
- I’m waiting, Sir, for the raven that must bring us some food tonight!"

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.600
He replied.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.960
- The raven ? What do you mean ?answered the man

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.840
The mother who was a little embarrassed to explain the fact,told what had just happened.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.120
Moved to tears, he looked at himself; at his costume

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.400
He was the mayor of the town and, he was a Christian.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.120
- Really, he said, ”I am dressed all in black like a raven !

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.000
No doubt God has sent me!

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.200
Get your basket, my boy, and come with me."

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.480
The boy, very joyful was soon ready and he took with one hand his basket

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:38.760
and with the other hand, he gave his hand to a wealthy and generous man and came back with his basket full of bread and meat.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.820
He soon returned with triumph, shouting :

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.300
- Do you see, mother, God answered your prayer !

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.520
Yes, the Lord is nearby those who shout at him truly !

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.360
He takes care of the orphan and the widow.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.720
He shows His love to those who wait on His goodness.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.980
The Word of God says in Psalm 50 verse 15, says:

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:15.840
”Call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me. »

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.000
