on the body that in the human world they

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the soul society something like that and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
the soul society something like that and
I<00:01:09.510> guess<00:01:09.689> these<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.560> replications<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
I guess these are like replications I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.359 
I guess these are like replications I
think<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.840> guess<00:01:13.140> their<00:01:13.320> soul<00:01:13.710> society

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
think or like I guess their soul society

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
think or like I guess their soul society
guy<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:15.150> tipping<00:01:15.479> over

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
guy was tipping over

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
guy was tipping over
so<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.799> Renji<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> ikkaku

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so that's not really Renji and ikkaku

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
so that's not really Renji and ikkaku
although<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.810> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> same

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
although they kind of have a same

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
although they kind of have a same
personality<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> same<00:01:21.119> thoughts<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> same

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
personality the same thoughts the same

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
personality the same thoughts the same
everything<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> thought<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> nice

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
everything so I thought that was a nice

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.890 
everything so I thought that was a nice
little<00:01:23.790> touch<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.330> whatever<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> kind<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
little touch or whatever it kind of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
little touch or whatever it kind of
reminds<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.650> again<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> mount

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
reminds me back again like on the mount

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.319 
reminds me back again like on the mount
arc<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:28.320> reminds<00:01:28.860> me<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> someone<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.850> when

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
arc it reminds me of someone that when

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
arc it reminds me of someone that when
uh<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> replication

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
uh you know how there was a replication

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
uh you know how there was a replication
of<00:01:32.790> them<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.150> had<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> memories<00:01:33.750> everything

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
of them and had the memories everything

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
of them and had the memories everything
so<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> thought<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.549> cool

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so I thought that was kind of a cool

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
so I thought that was kind of a cool
little<00:01:36.509> touch<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.049> said<00:01:37.259> um<00:01:37.470> read<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
Rukia buses Ichigo out of the jail and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.480 
Rukia buses Ichigo out of the jail and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
excited though more about the enemy
because<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.180> manga<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.660> know<00:02:21.930> we've<00:02:22.080> been

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
because the manga you know we've been

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.480 
because the manga you know we've been
going<00:02:22.350> through<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.710> lot<00:02:22.740> lately

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
going through a lot lately

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.030 
going through a lot lately
you<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.360> recently<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.260> has<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> bit<00:02:25.830> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you know just recently that has a bit of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.480 
you know just recently that has a bit of
an<00:02:26.310> improvement<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.300> overall<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.800> think

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
an improvement but overall the I think

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.130 
an improvement but overall the I think
the<00:02:29.550> anime<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.060> definitely<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.750> better

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the anime is definitely going a better

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.070 
the anime is definitely going a better
direction<00:02:31.650> than<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> bonger<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:33.080> overall

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
direction than the bonger was overall

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.860 
direction than the bonger was overall
though<00:02:34.760> we'll<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.360> happens<00:02:36.450> if

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
though we'll have to see what happens if

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
though we'll have to see what happens if
there<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.050> consumers<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
there are consumers like this is and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.420 
there are consumers like this is and
it's<00:02:38.610> crazy<00:02:38.820> because<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> filler<00:02:39.720> art

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's crazy because this is a filler art

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.920 
it's crazy because this is a filler art
maybe<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.670> would<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:41.850> better<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.750> best

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
maybe it would be better in the best

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.960 
maybe it would be better in the best
interest<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.380> bleach<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.520> filler<00:02:44.730> arc

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
interest of bleach if the filler arc

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.120 
interest of bleach if the filler arc
actually<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.590> becomes<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
actually you know just becomes like a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.950 
actually you know just becomes like a
part<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> story<00:02:47.820> or<00:02:48.000> something<00:02:48.330> maybe<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
part of the story or something maybe it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.020 
part of the story or something maybe it
would<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.230> best<00:02:49.770> if<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> enemy<00:02:50.640> goes<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.970> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
would be best if the enemy goes in a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.520 
would be best if the enemy goes in a
completely<00:02:51.060> different<00:02:51.720> direction<00:02:51.990> than<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
completely different direction than the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.780 
completely different direction than the
manga<00:02:52.980> because<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.030> manga<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:56.430> would<00:02:56.550> kind<00:02:56.760> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
manga because the manga it would kind of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
manga because the manga it would kind of
be<00:02:56.910> very<00:02:57.180> boring<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.560> know

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
be very boring to see you know

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.320 
be very boring to see you know
especially<00:02:59.190> all<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> chapters<00:02:59.760> before<00:02:59.910> this

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
especially all the chapters before this

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.190 
especially all the chapters before this
latest<00:03:00.540> chapter<00:03:01.350> -<00:03:01.880> how<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.570> boring<00:03:03.900> they

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
were and so to see that and it made it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.170
