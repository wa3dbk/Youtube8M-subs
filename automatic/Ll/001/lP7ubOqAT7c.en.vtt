 hello welcome to my kitchen today we are going to 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.360
 prepare some great churros 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.360
 For this we need a glass of 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.080
 Water 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.930
 flour also a small teaspoon 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.830
 of yeast and another small teaspoon 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 of salt we start in a pot we go to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:45.090
 put the water cup 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 once it starts to boil we will add the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
 flour 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.699
 we have water to boil and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.360
 now is the time to add a 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.020
 teaspoon of coffee 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 of salt 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.540
 we remove a little 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.750
 and remove from the fire 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.659
 on the other hand we are going to put the flour 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:19.749
 and also basic teaspoon 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.749

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.470

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.590

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 and we will remove it 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.240

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 apt to make churritos that that already 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.479
