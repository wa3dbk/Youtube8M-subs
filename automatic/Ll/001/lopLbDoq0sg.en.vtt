but I mean you just can't beat the

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.800 
but I mean you just can't beat the
colors<00:02:29.680> super<00:02:30.680> team<00:02:31.299> nice<00:02:32.299> bright<00:02:32.780> white

colors super team nice bright white

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.150 
colors super team nice bright white
belly<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:36.079> this<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.410> also<00:02:36.560> what<00:02:36.739> happens<00:02:37.040> when

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
belly and this is also what happens when

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.210 
belly and this is also what happens when
you<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> quality<00:02:37.819> captive<00:02:38.329> bred<00:02:38.450> animal

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.190 

and<00:02:52.260> they<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.500> better<00:02:52.710> with<00:02:52.920> age<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.930> some

and they get better with age I got some

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.470 
and they get better with age I got some
big<00:02:59.190> plans<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.730> when<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> got<00:03:00.090> some<00:03:00.270> cool

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
big plans for this when I got some cool

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570 
big plans for this when I got some cool
captive<00:03:00.900> hatch<00:03:01.050> stuff<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:02.280> he'll<00:03:02.430> probably

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
captive hatch stuff that he'll probably

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.330 
captive hatch stuff that he'll probably
going<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.320> see<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.620> prove<00:03:04.800> some<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.220> it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
going to see if I can prove some of it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.130 
going to see if I can prove some of it
out<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:07.110> white<00:03:07.290> head<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.860> awesome<00:03:09.140> in

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
out that white head is just awesome in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080 
out that white head is just awesome in
case<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:11.100> know<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:11.340> your<00:03:11.490> ball<00:03:11.640> python

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
case you know all your ball python

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.210 
case you know all your ball python
people<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.500> probably<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.040> cheap

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
people you probably know what a cheap

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.130 
people you probably know what a cheap
positive<00:03:14.790> blood<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.630> I'll<00:03:15.720> show<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:15.960> one

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
positive blood is and I'll show you one

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.700 
positive blood is and I'll show you one
of<00:03:16.170> those<00:03:16.290> over<00:03:16.650> here

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.280 

see<00:03:21.710> just<00:03:22.070> slightly<00:03:22.490> different<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.080> more

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
see just slightly different this is more

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.780 
see just slightly different this is more
of<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.560> equivalent<00:03:25.130> I'll<00:03:25.340> put<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.580> in<00:03:25.610> ball

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
of the equivalent I'll put it in ball

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.870 
of the equivalent I'll put it in ball
python<00:03:26.180> terms<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.880> caramel

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
python terms this is like a caramel

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.300 
python terms this is like a caramel
albino<00:03:29.270> koala<00:03:30.020> python<00:03:31.930> which<00:03:33.010> these<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.070> more

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
albino koala python which these are more

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.180 
albino koala python which these are more
common<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.870> blood<00:03:36.080> world<00:03:36.320> as<00:03:36.740> opposed<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
common in the blood world as opposed to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.670 
common in the blood world as opposed to
like<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:37.550> true<00:03:37.820> albino<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:39.410> would<00:03:39.530> be

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
like a true albino and this would be

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.150 
like a true albino and this would be
like<00:03:39.710> your<00:03:40.040> regular<00:03:40.690> shirt<00:03:41.690> off<00:03:41.840> albino<00:03:42.230> ball

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
like your regular shirt off albino ball

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.620 
like your regular shirt off albino ball
python<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:47.500> you'll<00:03:48.500> get<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> little<00:03:48.800> deeper<00:03:49.190> red

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
python so you'll get a little deeper red

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.350 
python so you'll get a little deeper red
means<00:03:50.630> will<00:03:50.810> get<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:51.200> whole<00:03:51.530> lot<00:03:51.680> more<00:03:51.920> red

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
means will get a whole lot more red

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.070 
means will get a whole lot more red
firstly<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.390> prefer<00:03:53.810> these<00:03:53.930> that's<00:03:54.350> just<00:03:54.590> me<00:03:56.080> me

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
firstly I prefer these that's just me me

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.640 
firstly I prefer these that's just me me
still<00:03:58.540> these<00:03:59.540> are<00:03:59.720> still<00:03:59.930> more<00:04:00.590> expensive

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
still these are still more expensive

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.850 
still these are still more expensive
than<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.280> cheap<00:04:01.460> positive<00:04:01.910> things<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:03.140> sure
