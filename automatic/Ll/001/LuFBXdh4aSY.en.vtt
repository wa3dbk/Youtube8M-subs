good<00:02:56.940> stuff<00:02:58.220> what<00:02:59.220> I<00:03:01.430> thought<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.550> was

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
good stuff what I thought that was

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090 
good stuff what I thought that was
hilarious<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.450> thought<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.140> was<00:03:04.290> absolutely

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
hilarious I thought that was absolutely

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.850 
hilarious I thought that was absolutely
hilarious<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.180> apparently<00:03:06.740> products<00:03:07.740> that

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
hilarious so apparently products that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.030 
hilarious so apparently products that
i'm<00:03:07.980> using<00:03:08.150> are<00:03:09.150> allowing<00:03:09.420> my<00:03:09.720> hair<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.830> look

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
i'm using are allowing my hair to look

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.000 
i'm using are allowing my hair to look
like<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.850> actually<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> different<00:03:13.200> texture

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
like it's actually a different texture

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.350 
like it's actually a different texture
than<00:03:14.190> its<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> thought<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.730> was<00:03:17.910> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
than its I then I thought it was and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840 
than its I then I thought it was and
then<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.840> began<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.290> maybe<00:03:19.770> this<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.670> its

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
then I began to think maybe this is its

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.030 
then I began to think maybe this is its
natural<00:03:21.420> state<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.230> never<00:03:22.470> knew<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.710> it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
natural state and I never knew that it

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.060 
natural state and I never knew that it
this<00:03:23.340> was<00:03:23.520> its<00:03:23.670> natural<00:03:24.180> state<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.920> don't<00:03:25.920> know

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
this was its natural state I don't know

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.530 
this was its natural state I don't know
because<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.460> haven't<00:03:26.940> had<00:03:27.030> my<00:03:27.090> hair<00:03:27.360> like<00:03:27.480> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
because I haven't had my hair like this

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.600 
because I haven't had my hair like this
since<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.960> was<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.230> since<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.620> was<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> child<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.580> I

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
since I was it since I was a child so I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.940 
since I was it since I was a child so I
don't<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> don't<00:03:30.300> remember<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> maybe<00:03:31.770> it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
don't know I don't remember so maybe it

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.570
