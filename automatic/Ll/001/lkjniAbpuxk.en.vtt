gold-dredging on the collar puia River

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.089 
gold-dredging on the collar puia River
we're<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.750> out<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> Brownsville<00:00:10.500> Oregon<00:00:13.099> and

today<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:19.050> river<00:00:19.410> splits<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.840> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
today the river splits right here this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
today the river splits right here this
is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.080> smaller<00:00:23.060> smaller<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:24.390> less<00:00:24.660> water<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
is a smaller smaller side less water and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.710 
is a smaller smaller side less water and
then<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> big<00:00:26.070> island<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.820> we're

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
then there's a big island and we're

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
then there's a big island and we're
gonna<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:28.050> dredging<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> other<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:29.099> in

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
gonna be dredging on the other side in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.120 
gonna be dredging on the other side in
the<00:00:29.369> main<00:00:29.550> channel<00:00:30.679> there's<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> piece<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the main channel there's a piece of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
the main channel there's a piece of
bedrock<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.759> goes<00:00:32.940> against<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.860> current

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
bedrock that goes against the current

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100 
bedrock that goes against the current
it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> nice<00:00:36.120> square<00:00:36.420> edge<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's a nice square edge on the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350 
it's a nice square edge on the
downstream<00:00:37.559> side<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:38.940> gonna<00:00:39.030> try<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
downstream side and we're gonna try to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.639 
downstream side and we're gonna try to
follow<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> gravel<00:00:40.860> bar<00:00:42.649> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
follow that up into a gravel bar so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
follow that up into a gravel bar so
we'll<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.370> let's<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
we found some decent gold sampling

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
we found some decent gold sampling
around<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.989> we're<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.350> optimistic<00:00:49.590> about

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
around so we're pretty optimistic about

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.279 
around so we're pretty optimistic about
