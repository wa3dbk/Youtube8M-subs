know you can swivel and round quicker
than<00:00:45.780> easier<00:00:46.079> than<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> was<00:00:46.559> before<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
than easier than it was before by the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.510 
than easier than it was before by the
way<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.289> notice<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> highlight

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
way and notice the when you highlight

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
way and notice the when you highlight
the<00:00:50.730> player<00:00:51.059> underneath<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.989> scale<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.530> got

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the player underneath the scale you got

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.369 
the player underneath the scale you got
the<00:00:52.860> action<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.489> moved<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the action and moved it from here it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.950 
the action and moved it from here it
used<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.980> next<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> player<00:00:56.969> under<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
used to be next to the player under the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
used to be next to the player under the
menu<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.710> we've<00:00:58.829> gone<00:00:58.920> ahead<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> put<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
menu so we've gone ahead and put it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
menu so we've gone ahead and put it
underneath<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> player<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.140> quicker

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
underneath the player so it's quicker

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
underneath the player so it's quicker
and<00:01:01.620> easier<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:03.030> other<00:01:03.270> thing<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and easier to use the other thing that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
and easier to use the other thing that
we<00:01:03.840> did<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.290> improved<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.820> tools<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.900> you'll

you already know of so that's the solid

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.260 
you already know of so that's the solid
line<00:01:12.780> tool<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.830> dashed<00:01:14.310> arrow<00:01:14.700> tool

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
line tool that's the dashed arrow tool

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.830 
line tool that's the dashed arrow tool
we've<00:01:15.659> concluded<00:01:16.340> one<00:01:17.340> without<00:01:17.580> arrows<00:01:18.270> as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
pick on an existing practice that's been
created<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
created for this I'm going to go to the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.750 
created for this I'm going to go to the
session<00:01:56.969> builder

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
session builder

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.460 
session builder
this<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.570> one<00:01:59.870> that<00:02:00.520> originated<00:02:01.520> from<00:02:01.940> version

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
this is one that originated from version

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.290 
this is one that originated from version
1.5<00:02:03.470> this<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.370> is<00:02:04.730> from<00:02:05.240> version<00:02:06.070> 1.6<00:02:07.070> so<00:02:07.760> you

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
1.5 this one is from version 1.6 so you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.060 
1.5 this one is from version 1.6 so you
can<00:02:08.510> see<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.869> difference<00:02:09.380> between<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.860> two

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
can see the difference between the two

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400 
can see the difference between the two
you<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.610> curved<00:02:10.880> arrow<00:02:11.210> or<00:02:11.810> what<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.080> did

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
you see that curved arrow or what I did

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.360 
you see that curved arrow or what I did
I<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:12.770> went<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.270> curved<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.340> drew<00:02:16.340> that

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I just went to this curved and drew that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.120 
I just went to this curved and drew that
in<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.780> can<00:02:17.810> see<00:02:18.010> that's<00:02:19.010> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
in there as you can see that's it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.030 
in there as you can see that's it
perfectly<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.230> other<00:02:21.380> thing<00:02:21.800> is

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
perfectly for you and the other thing is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.240 
perfectly for you and the other thing is
the<00:02:22.910> target<00:02:23.450> area<00:02:23.630> it's<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.170> new<00:02:24.380> tool<00:02:24.680> which<00:02:25.010> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the target area it's a new tool which is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.490 
the target area it's a new tool which is
the<00:02:25.430> circle<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.420> drew<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.990> there<00:02:27.290> it's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the circle so I drew that there it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.010 
the circle so I drew that there it's
quite<00:02:27.650> easy<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.100> use<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.820> drag<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.330> shape

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
quite easy to use you just drag it shape

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.440 
quite easy to use you just drag it shape
it<00:02:30.200> into<00:02:30.320> any<00:02:30.590> size<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.880> want

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
it into any size that you want

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.500 
it into any size that you want
and<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.350> adjust<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.950> line<00:02:34.220> here<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
and you can adjust the line here and the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.900 
and you can adjust the line here and the
feel<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.110> transparency<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.130> well<00:02:37.430> nice

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
feel for the transparency is well nice

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.960 
feel for the transparency is well nice
so<00:02:38.350> delete<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.640> other<00:02:40.850> one

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so delete that one and the other one

this<00:03:03.920> one<00:03:04.130> here<00:03:04.190> that's<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:04.820> highlighted

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
this one here that's just highlighted

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.920

the<00:03:17.209> color<00:03:17.450> of<00:03:17.540> course<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.860> choose<00:03:19.100> red

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
the color of course so if I choose red

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.009 
the color of course so if I choose red
changes<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.600> color

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
changes it to that color

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.860 
changes it to that color
so<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.860> by<00:03:22.040> these<00:03:22.100> useful<00:03:22.820> tools<00:03:23.420> here

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
so just by these useful tools here

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.410 
so just by these useful tools here
there's<00:03:24.350> been<00:03:24.560> massive<00:03:25.150> improvements<00:03:26.150> to

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
there's been massive improvements to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.840 
there's been massive improvements to
designing<00:03:27.230> your<00:03:27.440> practices<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.640> makes

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
designing your practices it just makes

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.750 
designing your practices it just makes
it<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.810> much<00:03:29.870> easier<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.620> quicker<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:31.100> use<00:03:31.489> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
it so much easier and quicker to use and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.150 
it so much easier and quicker to use and
and<00:03:31.970> also<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.080> end<00:03:33.200> result<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.920> looks

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
and also that the end result just looks

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.370 
and also that the end result just looks
so<00:03:34.459> much<00:03:34.489> better<00:03:34.850> as<00:03:35.150> well<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.660> moving<00:03:35.900> on

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
so much better as well so moving on

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.190 
so much better as well so moving on
the<00:03:36.530> other<00:03:36.800> thing<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.190> we<00:03:37.489> introduced<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.690> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
the other thing that we introduced is a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.120 
the other thing that we introduced is a
neat<00:03:39.709> import<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.820> export<00:03:40.940> feature<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:42.470> now

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
neat import and export feature so now

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
you can quite easily export your

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.170 
you can quite easily export your
existing<00:03:45.650> practices<00:03:46.340> if<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.700> want<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.940> share

go ahead and open that there you go

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.850 
go ahead and open that there you go
import<00:04:21.070> open<00:04:21.700> done<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.690> if<00:04:22.990> you've<00:04:23.170> notice<00:04:23.650> the

import open done so if you've notice the
other<00:04:23.980> thing<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.280> we<00:04:24.520> added<00:04:24.670> in<00:04:25.740> 1.6<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
other thing that we added in 1.6 is the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.670 
other thing that we added in 1.6 is the
file<00:04:27.700> name<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:28.630> visible<00:04:29.230> at<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.410> top

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
file name is now visible at the top

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.040 
file name is now visible at the top
right<00:04:29.950> hand<00:04:30.190> corner<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.030> know<00:04:31.360> what<00:04:31.750> file

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
right hand corner so you know what file

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.830 
right hand corner so you know what file
you're<00:04:32.500> working<00:04:32.980> on<00:04:33.100> at<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.580> time<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.690> this

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
you're working on at that time so this

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.690 
you're working on at that time so this
is<00:04:35.020> just<00:04:35.170> another<00:04:35.500> small<00:04:35.740> change<00:04:35.890> that<00:04:36.280> makes

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
is just another small change that makes

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.580 
is just another small change that makes
a<00:04:36.850> massive<00:04:37.060> difference<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:38.080> other<00:04:38.230> thing<00:04:38.440> we

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
a massive difference the other thing we

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.290 
a massive difference the other thing we
did<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.800> improve<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.550> training<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.090> match

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
did is improve the training the match

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.900 
did is improve the training the match
notes<00:04:40.600> again<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.740> training<00:04:42.310> notes<00:04:42.550> you'll

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
notes again so in training notes you'll

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.700 
notes again so in training notes you'll
notice<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:43.690> there's<00:04:43.930> dropdowns<00:04:44.410> for

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
notice that there's dropdowns for

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.760 
notice that there's dropdowns for
everything<00:04:45.190> now<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.780> there's<00:04:46.780> also<00:04:47.380> tick

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
everything now and there's also tick

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.510 
everything now and there's also tick
boxes<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.610> level<00:04:49.120> or<00:04:49.360> age<00:04:49.900> groups<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.590> let's

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
boxes for level or age groups so let's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.600 
boxes for level or age groups so let's
just<00:04:51.700> say<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.090> practice<00:04:52.660> is<00:04:52.870> applicable<00:04:53.200> for

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
just say this practice is applicable for

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.030 
just say this practice is applicable for
under<00:04:54.610> eights<00:04:54.790> all<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.180> way<00:04:55.300> up<00:04:55.450> to<00:04:55.780> 18<00:04:56.710> plus

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
under eights all the way up to 18 plus

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.930 
under eights all the way up to 18 plus
so<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:57.670> tick<00:04:58.090> all<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.510> above<00:04:59.140> options<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:00.010> if

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
so you tick all the above options and if

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.660 
so you tick all the above options and if
you<00:05:01.090> go<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.320> print<00:05:02.320> you'll<00:05:02.740> notice<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.520> it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
you go to print you'll notice that it

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
you go to print you'll notice that it
adds<00:05:03.910> it<00:05:04.300> here<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:04.840> it's<00:05:04.990> got<00:05:05.110> under<00:05:05.740> 8<00:05:05.980> to<00:05:06.910> 18

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
adds it here so it's got under 8 to 18

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.050 
adds it here so it's got under 8 to 18
plus<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.560> that's<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.830> neat<00:05:09.040> little<00:05:09.280> change<00:05:09.730> and

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
plus so that's a neat little change and

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.390 
plus so that's a neat little change and
go<00:05:10.810> back<00:05:11.020> into<00:05:11.230> it<00:05:11.380> go<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> match<00:05:12.040> notes

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
go back into it go to match notes

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.840 
go back into it go to match notes
instead<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.360> just<00:05:13.570> selecting<00:05:14.410> 11<00:05:15.040> v<00:05:15.160> 11<00:05:15.670> of

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
instead of just selecting 11 v 11 of

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.300 
instead of just selecting 11 v 11 of
course<00:05:16.120> not<00:05:16.360> everyone<00:05:16.600> plays<00:05:17.020> 11<00:05:17.500> v<00:05:17.650> 11<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.250> you

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
course not everyone plays 11 v 11 so you

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.390 
course not everyone plays 11 v 11 so you
may<00:05:18.550> play<00:05:18.820> 7<00:05:19.210> v<00:05:19.360> 7<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.920> choose<00:05:21.370> your

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
may play 7 v 7 and you just choose your

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.830 
may play 7 v 7 and you just choose your
formation<00:05:22.030> for<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.230> system<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.310> play<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.780> if

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
formation for that system of play so if

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360 
formation for that system of play so if
I<00:05:25.960> go<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.220> print

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
I go to print

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
I go to print
I<00:05:27.550> go<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.390> match<00:05:28.780> notes<00:05:29.760> you'll<00:05:30.760> see<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:31.120> here

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
I go to match notes you'll see it here

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.590 
I go to match notes you'll see it here
the<00:05:31.750> formation<00:05:32.410> so<00:05:33.310> lastly<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.120> want<00:05:34.510> to
