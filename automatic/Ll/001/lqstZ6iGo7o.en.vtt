00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
why is coaching technique to elite

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.940 
why is coaching technique to elite
players<00:00:02.460> important<00:00:03.230> it's<00:00:04.230> fundamental<00:00:04.920> to

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
players important it's fundamental to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.880 
players important it's fundamental to
every<00:00:05.640> player<00:00:05.879> but<00:00:06.240> especially<00:00:07.049> as<00:00:07.710> they

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
every player but especially as they

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.310 
every player but especially as they
start<00:00:08.160> developing<00:00:08.639> your<00:00:08.760> ages<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.750> think<00:00:10.230> it

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
start developing your ages I think it

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.470 
start developing your ages I think it
was<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.530> music<00:00:10.860> at<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.309> World<00:00:11.790> Cup

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
was a music at the World Cup

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.600 
was a music at the World Cup
French<00:00:12.870> coach<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.650> who<00:00:13.860> won<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> World<00:00:14.549> Cup

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
French coach there who won the World Cup

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.480 
French coach there who won the World Cup
of<00:00:14.849> France<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.780> he<00:00:16.109> said<00:00:16.379> without<00:00:16.619> technique

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
of France and he said without technique

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.700 
of France and he said without technique
there's<00:00:17.640> no<00:00:17.850> tactic<00:00:18.410> basically<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.590> he's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
there's no tactic basically what he's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.170 
there's no tactic basically what he's
saying<00:00:19.740> there<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.340> coaches<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.820> could<00:00:21.060> have

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
saying there is as coaches we could have

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
saying there is as coaches we could have
systems<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.720> play<00:00:21.980> styles<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.130> play<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.609> can

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
systems of play styles of play we can

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.220 
systems of play styles of play we can
have<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> best<00:00:24.210> laid<00:00:24.359> plans<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
have the best laid plans but if the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
have the best laid plans but if the
players<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.710> unable<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> perform<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.760> basic

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
players are unable to perform the basic

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.730 
players are unable to perform the basic
techniques<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> game

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
techniques of the game

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
techniques of the game
there<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.519> no<00:00:29.699> tactical<00:00:30.330> element<00:00:30.750> so

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there really is no tactical element so

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.069 
there really is no tactical element so
it's<00:00:31.320> vital<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.880> elite<00:00:33.180> stage<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.809> players

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it's vital at the elite stage as players

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's vital at the elite stage as players
are<00:00:34.200> developing<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.130> constantly<00:00:35.610> work

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
are developing that we constantly work

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.299 
are developing that we constantly work
on<00:00:36.120> their<00:00:36.300> technique<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.620> increase<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
on their technique and we increase the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
on their technique and we increase the
demands<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:38.879> those<00:00:39.059> players<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> they're

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
demands on those players so that they're

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
demands on those players so that they're
playing<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.440> speed<00:00:40.820> under<00:00:41.820> pressure<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.390> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
playing at speed under pressure and on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
playing at speed under pressure and on
demand<00:00:43.399> what<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> major<00:00:44.820> differences

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
demand what are the major differences

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
demand what are the major differences
between<00:00:45.539> coaching<00:00:46.320> lower<00:00:46.620> level<00:00:47.039> players<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
between coaching lower level players and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.170 
between coaching lower level players and
elite<00:00:48.030> players<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.980> think<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:51.000> biggest

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
elite players I think the the biggest

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.779 
elite players I think the the biggest
difference<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.219> coaching<00:00:53.219> elite<00:00:53.489> players

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
difference is in coaching elite players

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
difference is in coaching elite players
is<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.719> challenge<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.800> it's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
is how you can challenge them it's it's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
is how you can challenge them it's it's
easier<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:56.969> say<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> player<00:00:58.379> from

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
easier I would say to take a player from

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.330 
easier I would say to take a player from
50%<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.550> their<00:00:59.670> capacity<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.410> 80<00:01:01.680> 85

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
50% of their capacity up to about 80 85

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
50% of their capacity up to about 80 85
percent<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.940> their<00:01:03.090> overall<00:01:04.040> capacity<00:01:05.040> but

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
percent of their overall capacity but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
percent of their overall capacity but
the<00:01:05.850> hardest<00:01:06.210> part<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> game<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.930> training

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the hardest part of the game is training

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
the hardest part of the game is training
the<00:01:07.409> elite<00:01:07.710> players<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.400> getting<00:01:09.150> maybe<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the elite players and getting maybe that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350 
the elite players and getting maybe that
last<00:01:09.720> five<00:01:10.140> 10%<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
last five 10% and really you have to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
last five 10% and really you have to
concentrate<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> attention<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.860> detail

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
concentrate on the attention to detail

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.179 
concentrate on the attention to detail
with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> players<00:01:14.960> we<00:01:15.960> can't<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.380> say<00:01:16.830> first

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
with the players we can't just say first

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
with the players we can't just say first
touch<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.729> can't<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.150> say<00:01:18.299> look<00:01:18.810> over<00:01:19.049> your

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
touch you can't just say look over your

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.510 
touch you can't just say look over your
shoulder<00:01:19.560> people<00:01:19.950> need<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
shoulder people need to know what a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
shoulder people need to know what a
touch<00:01:20.790> Direction<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> people<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> make

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
touch Direction is people have to make

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960 
touch Direction is people have to make
decisions<00:01:22.979> based<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.580> pressure<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
decisions based on where pressure is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
decisions based on where pressure is
coming<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.290> important<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
coming from so it's very important that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
coming from so it's very important that
we<00:01:26.100> create<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.670> environment<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> their

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
we create the environment in their

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
we create the environment in their
training<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.200> their<00:01:28.350> technical<00:01:28.680> training

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
training and in their technical training

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.700 
training and in their technical training
especially<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.479> game<00:01:30.750> realistic<00:01:31.380> as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
especially that is as game realistic as

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
especially that is as game realistic as
possible<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> way<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> challenge

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
possible and that way we can challenge

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.069 
possible and that way we can challenge
the<00:01:33.960> elite<00:01:34.259> players<00:01:35.299> similar<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the elite players similar that we do to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.450 
the elite players similar that we do to
the<00:01:37.229> lower<00:01:37.409> level<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> recreational

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the lower level in the recreational

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
the lower level in the recreational
players<00:01:38.670> by<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.060> basic<00:01:39.450> technical<00:01:39.780> drills

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
players by just basic technical drills

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.440 
players by just basic technical drills
but<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.100> demands<00:01:41.490> become<00:01:41.850> higher<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
but the demands become higher on the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.590 
but the demands become higher on the
elite<00:01:42.659> player<00:01:43.340> how<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> motivate<00:01:44.790> elite

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
elite player how do you motivate elite

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.530 
elite player how do you motivate elite
players<00:01:45.869> during<00:01:46.259> practice<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.180> think<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
players during practice I think one of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
players during practice I think one of
the<00:01:48.630> big<00:01:49.040> motivations<00:01:50.040> obviously<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.579> any<00:01:50.729> age

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the big motivations obviously at any age

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.690 
the big motivations obviously at any age
in<00:01:51.240> any<00:01:51.420> stage<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.990> level<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> play<00:01:52.829> his

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
in any stage or level of play his

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
in any stage or level of play his
practice<00:01:54.180> needs<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.600> enjoyable<00:01:54.990> now

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
practice needs to be enjoyable now

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
practice needs to be enjoyable now
obviously<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> drills<00:01:57.149> aren't<00:01:57.420> demanding

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
obviously if the drills aren't demanding

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.319 
obviously if the drills aren't demanding
or<00:01:58.079> challenging<00:01:58.590> enough<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.729> decrease

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
or challenging enough that can decrease

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.030 
or challenging enough that can decrease
the<00:02:00.540> enjoyment<00:02:00.990> 4<00:02:01.079> players<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.799> be

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the enjoyment 4 players and they can be

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.380

get<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.520> better<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> then<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
get a little bit better and then the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
get a little bit better and then the
motivation<00:02:41.720> comes<00:02:42.350> within<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.920> their<00:02:43.580> own
