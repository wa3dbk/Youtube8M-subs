00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.379
 well these are from two to a new video 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 news the test quite important 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.439
 for many of you maybe pass 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.750
 unnoticed but as I say it is 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.580
 pretty pretty important good 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.139
 we can in the revelation that 2016 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.520
 we could have a new console or a 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.439
 announcement or the output of itself and 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.400
 it seems that there is media has already revealed 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.170
 you know that amd processors are 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.340
 they use in the consoles that we have 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.650
 currently the pri are 4 xbox one and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.050
 well it seems that this man of 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 fact that in 2016 they are working on a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.410
 chip that for a video game console that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.780
 will come out in 2016 has not said we know 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.320
 from now it will be released in 2016 on 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 chip 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.750
 it seems that it will have an architecture 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.030
 x86 and it seems that in xbox one and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.940
 Playstation 4 already use architecture 1 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.470
 and 1 and it seems that good people already 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.990
 start saying it will be a new 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.600
 console degÃ¼ello that is of nintendo the 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.100
 wii pussy the nintendo console i the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.640
 I really have one and you give others say that 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.040
 can be the successor of 3ds I have it 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.850
 my doubts enough I do not think it's 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.240
 like 2017 you will not agree because I do not 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 what game is going to be the precision 7 we 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.000
 can you say what I really think not 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 I think they are or not nintendo console 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.920
 It would be very risky to take out another 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 desktop console in 2016 aguayo yo 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 I think he has enough in life for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.280
 ahead 'has left quite recently in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.810
 Truth has not been done for so long and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 well I think that people would be angry 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.659
 pretty are taken to the console 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.210
 After dinner with which I do not think it's 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 nintendo a laptop I do not think so either 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.789
 to get to a laptop maybe it would arrive 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.789
 in 2017 2018 but 2016 I still believe it 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.440
 also very early I do not know in at 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.729
 less in my opinion I do not think it's 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.350
 nothing nintendo 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.289
 I think it could be a new 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 handheld console that could 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.679
 surprise quite a few say that 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 it might sound like sting machine but I 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.909
 I think this man has left quite 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 Of course it will be more focused what 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.030
 are video games, video games 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.970
 demos of consoles and others no no style 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.579
 of pc and all this so good yo 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.210
 I really think he sells nintendo I do not know 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.500
 I dont know 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.890
 it can be something else but 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.650
 I understand there are not many rumors running 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.560
 logically but good would be cool 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.470
 see how a new competition arises 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.660
 between good between microsoft and are 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 in which they have it quite subidito and 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.950
 good that someone but the punch 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.750
 on the table and say look at these 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.000
 offers look at this looking at yourself 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.440
 looking at how much and well we could 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 pretty flipar so well we'll see 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.060
 see what surprise you do not have for 2016 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 maybe a fucking shit or maybe 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.600
 something important we will see to see what or what 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.040
 that is happening so good nothing more 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.150
 kids this has been all in walk in 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.150
