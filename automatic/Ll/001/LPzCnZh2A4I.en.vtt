00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.890
 hello how he had his little 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:26.020
 horse first of all the material so a 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 cap that admits model belly or 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.560
 what and I have a little brush like 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.470
 it's very convenient but I think we 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.769
 have a hot water nickname tonight 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:01:10.440
 is obviously forbidden so first 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:01:10.440
 step draw all here is the difference 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:19.140
 so that's the second step 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.789
 I have the soap talent like that on it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.800
 I will not go 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:27.890
 do not hesitate on the water because it is 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:31.570
 frankly that's fine then normal game 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.660
 the place and and to know more a mite 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.500
 I often do a second time 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.500
 that he is really the same 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.680
 So here I am doing a maximum 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.290
 possible like that and usually have 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.250
 I'm doing this directly the gait can 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:30.380
 to really have water in minute is 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:35.300
 everywhere so you can if you do 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.400
 that rather than I do here because I 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.710
 do not see two or two tries 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.630
 but it's a bit dangerous 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.400
 do not hesitate if you launch it on 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:56.110
 message is not even that you think 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.110
 continue to count with them 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.110
 what do we say we really do not have 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:36.290
 good we'll see this in time I know 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:40.550
 no garden that is not with the 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:45.669
 Rain opens by Leila however the 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:51.050
 superb pieces is a max of sailboats 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:54.080
 like that so I 'm going to run after 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 again mado magnus and after 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:06.040
 you have it caught on a filament 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.040
 and out of trust because that's it
