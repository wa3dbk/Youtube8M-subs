00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
helicopter and that sounds really weird

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.170 
helicopter and that sounds really weird
like<00:02:19.830> why<00:02:19.980> would<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.280> want<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.760> buy<00:02:20.940> yourself

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
like why would you want to buy yourself

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
like why would you want to buy yourself
a<00:02:21.239> helicopter<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.930> random<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:23.069> how<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.880> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
a helicopter so random but how I see is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.580 
a helicopter so random but how I see is
if<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.480> buy<00:02:24.630> yourself<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.989> helicopter

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
if you can buy yourself a helicopter

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.949 
if you can buy yourself a helicopter
then<00:02:26.250> you're<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.180> exactly<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.569> poorest

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
then you're not exactly the poorest

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.390 
then you're not exactly the poorest
person<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.380> world<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.099> know<00:02:29.190> it's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
person in the world and you know it's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.009 
person in the world and you know it's
about<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> idea<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> flying

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
about like I like the idea of flying

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.420 
about like I like the idea of flying
like<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.500> could<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.680> fly<00:02:31.920> myself<00:02:32.069> around

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
like if I could just fly myself around

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.860 
like if I could just fly myself around
and<00:02:32.610> that's<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.390> that's<00:02:33.660> pretty

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and that's like I know that's pretty

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.199 
and that's like I know that's pretty
cool<00:02:34.050> guess<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.430> i<00:02:35.610> could<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.819> myself<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
cool guess but if i could get myself a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.460 
cool guess but if i could get myself a
helicopter<00:02:36.630> thing<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.989> would<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.170> pretty

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

at<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.720> very<00:05:08.960> least<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:10.040> remember<00:05:10.370> the

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
at the very least and I remember the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.160 
at the very least and I remember the
first<00:05:10.580> time<00:05:10.730> did<00:05:11.000> this<00:05:11.180> you<00:05:11.660> know<00:05:11.750> those<00:05:11.990> I

think was the most commented video on

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.340 
think was the most commented video on
doing<00:05:14.180> with<00:05:14.270> something<00:05:14.570> on<00:05:14.630> one<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.870> them<00:05:15.110> up

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
doing with something on one of them up

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.560 
doing with something on one of them up

four<00:05:17.900> times<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.260> amount<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.470> comments<00:05:18.890> that

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
four times the amount of comments that

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.040 
four times the amount of comments that

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.570 
and maybe check out our channel because
I'm<00:05:27.590> kind<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.890> running<00:05:28.040> out<00:05:28.220> of<00:05:28.280> things<00:05:28.460> to

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
I'm kind of running out of things to

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.830 
I'm kind of running out of things to
talk<00:05:28.640> about<00:05:28.760> because<00:05:29.090> when<00:05:29.450> it<00:05:29.540> comes<00:05:29.690> to

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
talk about because when it comes to

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.710 
talk about because when it comes to
money<00:05:29.960> like<00:05:30.460> really<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.490> think<00:05:31.610> only<00:05:31.940> people

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
money like really I think only people

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.820 
money like really I think only people
only<00:05:32.870> want<00:05:33.020> like<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.200> few<00:05:33.410> things<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:33.680> lab

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
only want like a few things in lab

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.110 
only want like a few things in lab
double<00:05:34.250> they<00:05:34.490> just<00:05:34.610> want<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.850> be<00:05:34.910> happy

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
double they just want to be happy

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.900 
double they just want to be happy
comfortable<00:05:35.480> and<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:36.800> guess<00:05:37.580> it's<00:05:37.730> premature

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
comfortable and I guess it's premature
