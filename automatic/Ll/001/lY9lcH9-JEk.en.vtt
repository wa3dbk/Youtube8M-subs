00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to pick a winner today give it 20 I'd

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.360 
to pick a winner today give it 20 I'd
give<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> defense<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.100> sure<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
give it to the defense for sure I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.029 
give it to the defense for sure I
thought<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.059> defense<00:00:57.539> today<00:00:57.750> came<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.829> with

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
thought the defense today came out with

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.700 
thought the defense today came out with
with<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> right<00:00:59.640> energy<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.300> passion<00:01:00.710> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
with the right energy and passion I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
with the right energy and passion I
thought<00:01:02.670> they're<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.210> focused<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
thought they're really focused and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.679 
thought they're really focused and
locked<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.350> early<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.450> played

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
locked in early on and they played

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.920 
locked in early on and they played
physical<00:01:07.820> enthusiastic<00:01:08.820> football<00:01:09.420> which<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
physical enthusiastic football which is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
physical enthusiastic football which is
the<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> style<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> play<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the the style of play that we like to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
the the style of play that we like to
play<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.939> thought<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:13.159> especially

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
play with I thought with especially

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
play with I thought with especially
early<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.939> were<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
early on we were really kind of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
early on we were really kind of
lackluster<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.409> offense<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.009> feel<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.220> we

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
lackluster on offense I feel like we

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
lackluster on offense I feel like we
were<00:01:17.430> coming<00:01:17.790> almost<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.110> bit<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.350> in

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
were coming almost a little bit like in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
were coming almost a little bit like in
slow<00:01:19.740> motion<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.600> sense

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
slow motion and kind of in a sense

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.539 
slow motion and kind of in a sense
couldn't<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> our<00:01:22.680> own<00:01:22.799> way<00:01:23.040> because

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
couldn't get out of our own way because

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
couldn't get out of our own way because
of<00:01:23.630> penalties<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.850> just<00:01:26.850> poor<00:01:27.330> execution<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of penalties and just poor execution I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
of penalties and just poor execution I
guess<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> best<00:01:28.799> best<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.729> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
guess would be the best best way to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
guess would be the best best way to
describe<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> make<00:01:31.170> excuses<00:01:31.710> but

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
describe it not to make excuses but

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
describe it not to make excuses but
without<00:01:32.130> standing<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> Jermaine<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
without standing on Jermaine is that a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
without standing on Jermaine is that a
factor<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.930> all<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.290> mean<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
factor in it all I mean I think that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
factor in it all I mean I think that
that<00:01:34.979> definitely<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> somewhat<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> factor

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that definitely is somewhat of a factor

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
that definitely is somewhat of a factor

performers<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> don't<00:01:39.689> have

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
performers you know that you don't have

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.090 
performers you know that you don't have
out<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.500> great<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:40.920> your

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
out there and it's great to have your

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
out there and it's great to have your
left<00:01:41.310> tackle<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.570> great<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.020> one

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
left tackle and it's great to have one

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
left tackle and it's great to have one
of<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.409> go-to<00:01:43.770> wide<00:01:43.950> receivers<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.640> think

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
of your go-to wide receivers but I think

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
of your go-to wide receivers but I think
we<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.689> enough<00:01:45.930> talent<00:01:46.110> offensively<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
we have enough talent offensively I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.930 
we have enough talent offensively I
think<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.880> perform<00:01:48.270> better<00:01:48.450> than<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.750> did

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
think we can perform better than we did

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.830 
think we can perform better than we did
because<00:01:50.940> when<00:01:51.120> you<00:01:51.210> look<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> know

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
because when you look at the you know

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.210 
because when you look at the you know
the<00:01:51.930> offense<00:01:52.229> no<00:01:52.440> turnovers<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.070> two

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the offense no turnovers for the two

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.680 
the offense no turnovers for the two
scrimmages<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.760> three<00:01:54.000> phones<00:01:54.150> didn't<00:01:54.540> get

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
scrimmages the three phones didn't get

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.719 
scrimmages the three phones didn't get
any<00:01:54.840> choice<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> which<00:01:56.220> side<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
any choice is it which side of that is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.700 
any choice is it which side of that is
the<00:01:57.330> more<00:01:57.360> upside<00:01:57.840> well<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.940> think<00:02:00.750> first<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the more upside well I think first the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.170 
the more upside well I think first the
biggest<00:02:01.920> upside<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.580> turn<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> ball<00:02:03.030> over

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
biggest upside is not turn the ball over

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.180 
biggest upside is not turn the ball over
you<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> big

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
you know I think that's one of the big

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.999 
you know I think that's one of the big
keys<00:02:05.690> when<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.810> look<00:02:06.960> at<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.500> turnover

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
keys when you look at the turnover

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
keys when you look at the turnover
margin<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.580> winning<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.330> losing<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.810> no

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
margin and winning and losing there's no

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.360 
margin and winning and losing there's no
more<00:02:10.170> telling<00:02:10.500> stat<00:02:10.740> than<00:02:10.979> winning<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
more telling stat than winning the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.670 
more telling stat than winning the
turnover<00:02:11.820> battle<00:02:11.930> equates<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> equates<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
turnover battle equates to equates to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
turnover battle equates to equates to
W's<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:15.150> easiest<00:02:15.630> way<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> win<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
W's and the easiest way to win the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.199 
W's and the easiest way to win the
turnover<00:02:16.410> battle<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.340> give<00:02:17.489> up<00:02:17.580> any<00:02:17.820> at

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
turnover battle is not to give up any at

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.470 
turnover battle is not to give up any at
least<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.569> even<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> think

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
least or even so I think that I think

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
least or even so I think that I think
potentially<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.620> lot<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.950> turnovers<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.489> occur

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
potentially a lot of turnovers can occur

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.220 
potentially a lot of turnovers can occur
on<00:02:23.880> quarterback<00:02:24.330> sacks<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.900> different

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
on quarterback sacks and different

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
on quarterback sacks and different
things<00:02:25.260> which<00:02:25.650> they<00:02:26.190> aren't<00:02:26.340> allowed<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> hit

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
things which they aren't allowed to hit

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.280 
things which they aren't allowed to hit
the<00:02:26.910> quarterback<00:02:27.239> right<00:02:27.570> now<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> one's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
the quarterback right now so that one's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.259 
the quarterback right now so that one's
a<00:02:28.410> hard<00:02:28.590> too<00:02:28.680> hard<00:02:28.860> one<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> tell<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.820> well<00:02:30.000> but

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
a hard too hard one to tell as well but

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.979 
a hard too hard one to tell as well but
I<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.920> our<00:02:32.070> defenses<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.940> ball<00:02:33.300> hungry<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
I think our defenses is ball hungry and

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.390 
I think our defenses is ball hungry and
they'll<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.380> after<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> football<00:02:34.950> every

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
they'll get after the football every

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.910 
they'll get after the football every
chance<00:02:35.640> they<00:02:35.820> get<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:36.959> appreciative<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.769> our

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
chance they get I'm appreciative of our

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.259 
chance they get I'm appreciative of our
quarterback<00:02:38.370> play<00:02:38.550> making<00:02:38.910> good<00:02:39.150> decisions

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
quarterback play making good decisions

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.940 
quarterback play making good decisions
and<00:02:39.780> our<00:02:39.900> running<00:02:40.200> backs<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.590> why<00:02:40.739> notes

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and our running backs and why notes

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710 
and our running backs and why notes
playing<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.610> high<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.880> tight<00:02:42.060> mentality

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
playing with high and tight mentality

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.350 
playing with high and tight mentality
and<00:02:42.950> they'll<00:02:43.950> only<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.910> reason<00:02:45.239> they

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and they'll only that the reason they

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880 
and they'll only that the reason they
are<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
are the way they are is because of the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.100 
are the way they are is because of the
way<00:02:47.010> we<00:02:47.040> practice<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.360> focus<00:02:48.630> by<00:02:48.959> our

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
way we practice and the focus by our

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.690 
way we practice and the focus by our
defense<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> football<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:50.459> it's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
defense on the football that now it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.600 
defense on the football that now it's
become<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> real<00:02:51.300> focus<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:51.870> offensive<00:02:52.200> team

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
become a real focus for offensive team

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.319 
become a real focus for offensive team
seemed<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.730> there<00:02:53.850> were<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> couple<00:02:54.000> times

seemed like there were a couple times

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.449 
seemed like there were a couple times

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
let the public know which one of those

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.430 
let the public know which one of those
guys<00:04:21.549> might<00:04:21.820> be<00:04:21.850> damned<00:04:22.150> oh<00:04:22.300> yeah<00:04:22.930> sure<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.320> is

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
guys might be damned oh yeah sure it is

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.920 
guys might be damned oh yeah sure it is
you<00:04:24.130> know<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.880> definitely<00:04:25.630> there<00:04:25.810> is

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
you know that definitely there is

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.870 
you know that definitely there is
because<00:04:26.140> they're<00:04:26.560> different<00:04:27.070> players<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.790> a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
because they're different players in a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.450 
because they're different players in a
sense<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.570> our<00:04:28.870> system<00:04:29.290> still<00:04:29.590> but<00:04:30.310> they

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
sense it is our system still but they

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.450 
sense it is our system still but they
are<00:04:30.640> different<00:04:30.880> players<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.229> think<00:04:33.070> if

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
are different players and I think if

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.700 
are different players and I think if
keesan<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:34.780> our<00:04:34.930> ability<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.350> move<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
keesan you know our ability to move the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.409 
keesan you know our ability to move the
quarterback<00:04:36.160> around<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.729> distinct

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
quarterback around is a distinct

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.480 
quarterback around is a distinct
advantage<00:04:37.510> for<00:04:38.080> us<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.289> when<00:04:38.380> Nixon<00:04:39.130> not<00:04:39.310> that

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
advantage for us and when Nixon not that

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.790 
advantage for us and when Nixon not that
Nick<00:04:39.640> can't<00:04:39.910> move<00:04:40.120> but<00:04:41.050> his<00:04:41.169> ability<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.770> throw

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
Nick can't move but his ability to throw

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.070 
Nick can't move but his ability to throw
the<00:04:42.130> football<00:04:42.280> are<00:04:42.729> all<00:04:43.030> over<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.539> field<00:04:43.750> and

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
the football are all over the field and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.370 
the football are all over the field and
see<00:04:44.260> coverages<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.010> something<00:04:46.380> advantageous

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
see coverages is something advantageous

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.800 
see coverages is something advantageous
for<00:04:47.680> his<00:04:47.830> game<00:04:48.039> so<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.520> think<00:04:48.970> if<00:04:49.300> somebody<00:04:49.630> knew
