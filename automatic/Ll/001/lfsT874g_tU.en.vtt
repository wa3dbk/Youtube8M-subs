00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
change it up sometimes and and having

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.120 
change it up sometimes and and having
that<00:01:13.210> posting<00:01:13.750> in<00:01:13.869> there<00:01:14.049> really<00:01:14.920> kind<00:01:15.100> of

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
that posting in there really kind of

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.980 
that posting in there really kind of
alleviates<00:01:15.580> your<00:01:15.790> arch<00:01:15.939> you<00:01:16.630> know<00:01:16.750> if<00:01:16.840> you're

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
alleviates your arch you know if you're

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.020 
alleviates your arch you know if you're
have<00:01:17.590> plantar<00:01:17.979> fasciitis<00:01:18.369> something<00:01:18.880> like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
have plantar fasciitis something like

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.840 
have plantar fasciitis something like
that<00:01:19.240> kind<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.049> helps<00:01:20.290> take<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.500> load<00:01:20.830> off<00:01:21.009> so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
that kind of helps take the load off so

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.999 
that kind of helps take the load off so
a<00:01:22.150> key<00:01:22.540> design<00:01:22.750> feature<00:01:23.170> there<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.650> usually

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
a key design feature there that usually

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.330 
a key design feature there that usually
makes<00:01:24.189> shoes<00:01:24.580> way<00:01:24.909> quite<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> bit<00:01:25.960> more<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
makes shoes way quite a bit more but

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.280 
makes shoes way quite a bit more but
still<00:01:27.670> relatively<00:01:28.390> lightweight<00:01:28.840> for<00:01:29.259> a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
still relatively lightweight for a

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.499

Scott shoes that I've reviewed we also

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.960 
Scott shoes that I've reviewed we also

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
of the shoe and it kind of rolls you

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.850 
of the shoe and it kind of rolls you
forward<00:01:42.250> much<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> rocking<00:01:43.600> chair<00:01:43.860> kind

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860

more<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.689> your<00:01:46.780> forefoot<00:01:47.229> or<00:01:47.470> maybe<00:01:47.649> you're

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
more on your forefoot or maybe you're

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.620 
more on your forefoot or maybe you're
you<00:01:48.430> know<00:01:48.549> striking<00:01:48.939> a<00:01:48.970> little<00:01:49.149> farther<00:01:49.329> back

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you know striking a little farther back

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.899 
you know striking a little farther back
you<00:01:50.140> get<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.290> kind<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.680> quicker<00:01:51.189> transition

you get a kind of a quicker transition
rolling<00:01:52.659> forward<00:01:53.049> it's<00:01:53.200> going<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.409> be

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
rolling forward it's going to be

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.859 
rolling forward it's going to be
promoting<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.460> more<00:01:54.670> efficient<00:01:55.210> running<00:01:55.390> style
