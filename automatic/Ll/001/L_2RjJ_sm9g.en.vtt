00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.540
 hello guys here we are the new one 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.650
 reviewed by the wars magazine today 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.869
 we are going to present an application 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.990
 for mac intended for those used to 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.030
 send e-mail or better a kind of 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.750
 wedding list therefore anyway the 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.140
 ability to send newsletters 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.190
 to more people the application is called 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.500
 me the designer 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.670
 now let's go to see it very truly 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.600
 very fast because also 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.940
 quite simple in its use 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.100
 you can see as soon as you start the first one 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.780
 time then move on to do transgreen for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.940
 to avoid being used we will have the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.950
 possibility of having the how to say a 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.780
 visual aid and a video in which there 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.690
 will allow us to understand what we can 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.809
 doing is like seeing something already created 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.089
 to show you how this works 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.119
 the screen still working where here 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.610
 we have applications that are better anyway 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.340
 of templates that are paid while 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 those who are 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.090
 inside our library are 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.869
 already present because there are some here 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.880
 several where we can of course 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.970
 use the theme based on what 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 we want to do in my design of course 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.200
 there will be various various templates that 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 we used to create precisely 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.159
 these newsletters we go to see one 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.229
 however very quickly we go to 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.150
 double-click the curves pediatricians 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.070
 this is the work screen where 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.780
 obviously a high part we all have 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 work tools 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.439
 then we have the opportunity to go to 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:49.220
 insert images or other types 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.470
 of images but also to choose 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.540
 the text as you can see we have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.490
 various available this and button 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.710
 obviously to go to load the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 various images we have a 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.300
 provision or even of the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.420
 of the text what interests us most 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.960
 obviously all this will serve for later 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.670
 after going to create a whole account 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.280
 bra section can be sent 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.240
 directly inside our e 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.310
 mail directly too 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.290
 from the application itself through memo 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 the button then as you see above 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.590
 sharing this is simply one 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.660
 trial lesson where we do anyway 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.180
 we can go to manage where to go to 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.400
 put the text to insert we can 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.540
 go to delete the individual sections 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.910
 for example, we don't care 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.920
 then go to delete lines and 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.830
 very interesting thing very hard 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.320
 we will also have an immediate preview for 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.630
 what concerns the visualization 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.630
 right on our mobile devices 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.980
 that's because anyway it will be 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.430
 precisely structured to be able to do so 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 view both on a computer like 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.310
 you can see here but also on the su 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.739
 mobile devices but also during how 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.530
 the typing ss so when we go 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.660
 to insert everything we want 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.160
 within our newsletter 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.650
 the visualization also mind we go to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.180
 write as if by sight then talent but 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.500
 we await through this preview 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.269
 surely it will be much simpler 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.319
 obviously we can go to insert 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.120
 more than a 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.170
 of a structure it will be enough to go to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.859
 choose which we want a device 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.530
 to be used for display 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.120
 so see both iphone 4 and 5 and ipad 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.109
 ipad mini but also for devices 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.450
 android or we could go to 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.340
 decide the visualizations as there 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.180
 interested simply by going 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.040
 to select of vice pres 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.999
 obviously for every single section we 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.159
 we could go and decide the text like 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:56.409
 had to be inserted the background e 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.919
 everything else obviously through 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.079
 these test panels then like 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:05.949
 you can really see an application 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.169
 very very easy to use e 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.810
 especially in the high comfortable for those 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.549
 must make their own say 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.099
 this newsletter can therefore be 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.470
 used as a base then after going to 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.030
 to send via the button 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.060
 precisely sharing 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.919
 or we want to go and export it yes 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.210
 then pdf as another format but also 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 in html code this was the application 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.750
 who wanted to show this to me 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.289
 it remains to greet you and see you at 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.500
 next 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.500
 Hello
