stuff with a triangle right there and
we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.820> use<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.270> hot<00:02:22.420> glue<00:02:22.570> gun<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.250 
we're going to use the hot glue gun to
seal<00:02:23.380> together<00:02:23.830> those<00:02:24.310> ends<00:02:25.120> because<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.750> don't

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
seal together those ends because I don't

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.610

know<00:02:26.350> how<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.530> sew<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.610> just<00:02:28.030> use<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> little

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
know how to sew so just use a little

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.010 
know how to sew so just use a little
glue<00:02:29.620> as<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.610> go<00:02:30.850> because<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.360> dries<00:02:31.600> really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
glue as you go because it dries really

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.230 
glue as you go because it dries really
really<00:02:32.230> fast<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.580> make<00:02:33.730> sure<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.030> press

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
really fast and just make sure you press

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.200 
really fast and just make sure you press
down<00:02:34.570> really<00:02:34.600> hard<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:36.220> won't<00:02:36.820> go

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
down really hard so that it won't go

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:48.180 
down really hard so that it won't go
anywhere<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.470> seam<00:02:38.830> won't<00:02:39.130> bust<00:02:39.370> open<00:02:47.190> so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
anywhere or the seam won't bust open so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.800 
anywhere or the seam won't bust open so
if<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.580> didn't<00:02:48.850> cut<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.270> first<00:02:49.540> time

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
if you didn't cut the first time

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.170 
if you didn't cut the first time
extremely<00:02:50.560> straight<00:02:51.100> that's<00:02:51.370> okay<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:51.970> go

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
extremely straight that's okay just go

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.150
