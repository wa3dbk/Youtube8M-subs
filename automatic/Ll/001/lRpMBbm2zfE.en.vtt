crib studies buddy buddy but anyway I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.290 
crib studies buddy buddy but anyway I
did<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> soloing<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.850> trip<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
did a lot of soloing this trip as you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.120 
did a lot of soloing this trip as you
guys<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> before<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
guys can see and this is before the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
guys can see and this is before the
double<00:00:23.400> loop<00:00:23.550> weekend<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> wanted<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> get

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
double loop weekend so I wanted to get

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
double loop weekend so I wanted to get
this<00:00:25.380> quick<00:00:25.680> episode<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:26.310> instead<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
this quick episode out instead of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140 
this quick episode out instead of
combining<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.810> double<00:00:28.109> loop<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.150> this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
combining the double loop and the this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
combining the double loop and the this
at<00:00:30.359> rep<00:00:30.539> soda<00:00:30.840> revs<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.380> one's<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> little

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
at rep soda revs so this one's a little

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.979 
at rep soda revs so this one's a little
bit<00:00:31.859> shorter<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.369> her<00:00:32.790> parents<00:00:33.030> beer<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
bit shorter and her parents beer but I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.580 
bit shorter and her parents beer but I
think<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.180> double<00:00:36.180> loop<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.930> am<00:00:37.170> going

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
think for the double loop one I am going

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139 
think for the double loop one I am going
to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.399> everything<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.059> much

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to do just everything pretty much

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.110 
to do just everything pretty much
because<00:00:39.450> I've<00:00:39.600> been<00:00:39.629> doing<00:00:40.250> glay<00:00:41.250> kors<00:00:41.520> Morgan

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
because I've been doing glay kors Morgan

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520 
because I've been doing glay kors Morgan
javelins<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.809> I've<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.050> doing<00:00:43.290> glai

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
javelins by the way I've been doing glai

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
javelins by the way I've been doing glai
cores<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.190> revs<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.480> probably<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.930> some

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cores and revs and I probably do some

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
cores and revs and I probably do some
guy<00:00:46.230> where<00:00:46.410> dungeon<00:00:46.739> 2<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.610> gonna<00:00:47.760> do

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

like<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> big<00:00:58.890> series<00:00:59.280> mash<00:00:59.460> up<00:00:59.670> before<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
like a big series mash up before the

revelant and we did get a lot of good

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
revelant and we did get a lot of good
double<00:01:04.229> loop<00:01:04.379> drops<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.400> forward

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
double loop drops so that look forward

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
double loop drops so that look forward
to<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.780> doing<00:01:07.080> some<00:01:07.229> glad<00:01:07.439> coach

so that'll hopefully be out Sunday for
the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.950> day<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.400> double<00:01:15.000> loop<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.330> then

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the first day of double loop and then

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.070 
the first day of double loop and then
monday<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.740> tuesday<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:18.030> next<00:01:18.630> double<00:01:18.930> loop

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
monday or tuesday the next double loop

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.280 
monday or tuesday the next double loop
video<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.659> nice<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:21.960> PK

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
video will be out so that nice little PK

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.770 
video will be out so that nice little PK
there<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.299> double<00:01:24.630> loop

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
there but that's some to double loop

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.130 
there but that's some to double loop
videos<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.740> i<00:01:25.770> am<00:01:25.979> planning<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.970> um<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
videos that i am planning so um it is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.240 
videos that i am planning so um it is
gonna<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.380> filled<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.590> everything<00:01:29.070> really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
gonna be filled with everything really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.550 
gonna be filled with everything really
like<00:01:29.790> i<00:01:29.909> said<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:30.960> forward<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like i said so look forward to that I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.190 
like i said so look forward to that I
think<00:01:31.680> they're<00:01:31.950> gonna<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.189> pretty<00:01:32.280> good<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
think they're gonna be pretty good and

think they're gonna be pretty good and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that lakers are probably the best choice

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.130

but<00:02:12.170> glucose<00:02:13.170> would<00:02:13.319> be<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> best<00:02:13.709> because

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
but glucose would be the best because

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
but glucose would be the best because
double<00:02:14.700> charge<00:02:14.940> would<00:02:15.090> mean<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.630> finish

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
double charge would mean that i finish

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.530 
double charge would mean that i finish
faster<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.860> i've<00:02:16.950> definitely<00:02:17.190> doing<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.580> got

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
faster so i've definitely doing that got

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.910 
faster so i've definitely doing that got
a<00:02:18.569> good<00:02:18.780> amount<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.020> char<00:02:19.200> drops<00:02:19.440> even<00:02:19.590> getting

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
a good amount of char drops even getting

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.550 
a good amount of char drops even getting
some<00:02:20.040> effigy<00:02:20.400> drops<00:02:20.670> mic<00:02:20.970> though<00:02:21.180> oh<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.170> no<00:02:22.380> f

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
depressing I was thinking about doing

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.309

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
to because next drops have just kind of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.570 
to because next drops have just kind of
plummeted<00:02:30.900> since<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> last<00:02:31.440> W<00:02:31.950> weekend<00:02:32.370> and
