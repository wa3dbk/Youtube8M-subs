the<00:00:49.519> most<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:49.909> can<00:00:49.940> go<00:00:50.239> ahead<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:50.479> do<00:00:50.720> without

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
the most you can go ahead and do without

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.860 
the most you can go ahead and do without
impacting<00:00:51.519> muscle<00:00:52.519> mass<00:00:52.670> gains<00:00:53.000> anything

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
impacting muscle mass gains anything

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.250 
impacting muscle mass gains anything
after<00:00:54.229> that<00:00:54.260> then<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.370> could<00:00:55.850> be<00:00:56.199> impacting<00:00:57.199> a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
after that then you could be impacting a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.990 
after that then you could be impacting a
little<00:00:57.559> bit<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.100> muscle<00:00:58.580> mass<00:00:58.699> gaining

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
little bit the muscle mass gaining

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.630 
little bit the muscle mass gaining
department<00:00:59.629> but<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.409> necessary<00:01:00.799> if<00:01:01.280> you're

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
department but it is necessary if you're

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.980 
department but it is necessary if you're
trying<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:02.119> just<00:01:02.989> get<00:01:03.879> highly<00:01:04.879> defined<00:01:05.239> okay

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
trying to just get highly defined okay

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.890 
trying to just get highly defined okay
so<00:01:06.619> basically<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.400> want<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.030> increase

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
so basically if you want to increase

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.870 
so basically if you want to increase
your<00:01:09.170> definition<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.100> you're<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.400> fat<00:01:10.610> loss

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
your definition and you're in a fat loss

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.539 
your definition and you're in a fat loss
phase<00:01:11.659> then<00:01:12.439> of<00:01:12.649> course<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.100> need<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.310> do<00:01:13.520> a

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
phase then of course you need to do a

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.099 
phase then of course you need to do a
little<00:01:13.820> bit<00:01:14.000> more<00:01:14.149> curry<00:01:14.420> on<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.600> three<00:01:14.869> times

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
little bit more curry on the three times

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:16.480 
little bit more curry on the three times
but<00:01:15.409> if<00:01:15.530> you're<00:01:15.680> just<00:01:15.859> looking<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.250> gain

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
but if you're just looking to gain

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.130 
but if you're just looking to gain
muscle<00:01:17.289> three<00:01:18.289> times<00:01:18.560> 20<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:19.490> 45<00:01:19.939> minutes<00:01:20.180> it's

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
muscle three times 20 to 45 minutes it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.749 
muscle three times 20 to 45 minutes it's
good<00:01:21.380> enough<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:21.859> I<00:01:21.890> hope<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.340> answered
