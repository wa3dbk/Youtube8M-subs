floating<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.270> there<00:01:53.710> just<00:01:54.710> as<00:01:54.979> easy<00:01:55.310> as<00:01:55.579> can<00:01:55.820> be

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
floating in there just as easy as can be

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.069

wipe<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.570> back<00:01:56.930> while<00:01:57.829> it's<00:01:58.009> wet<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.450> then<00:01:59.810> I

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
wipe that back while it's wet and then I

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.620 
wipe that back while it's wet and then I
went<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:00.829> got<00:02:01.030> into<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> section<00:02:02.509> where

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
went and I got into the section where

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.319

it right in this section and it look
like<00:02:09.020> it's<00:02:09.320> floating<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:10.070> around<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
like it's floating right around in the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.510 
like it's floating right around in the
water<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.900> can<00:02:12.080> take<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.500> pull<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.280> little

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
water you can take and pull up a little

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.759 
water you can take and pull up a little
bit<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.910> area<00:02:14.239> where<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:14.989> get<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:15.500> green

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
now it can't look like there's just a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
now it can't look like there's just a
