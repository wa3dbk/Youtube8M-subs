strip mine design it's big it's new it's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
strip mine design it's big it's new it's
way<00:00:43.590> better<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.250> anything<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> I've<00:00:45.059> seen

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
way better than anything that I've seen

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.000 
way better than anything that I've seen
really<00:00:46.110> before<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.710> much

really before and it's just so much
better<00:00:50.399> than<00:00:51.270> other<00:00:52.110> strip<00:00:52.559> mining

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
better than other strip mining

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.790 
better than other strip mining
techniques<00:00:53.600> now<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> lot

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
techniques now this will get you a lot

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
techniques now this will get you a lot
of<00:00:57.320> exposed<00:00:58.320> ores<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> such<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:02.270> lot<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.480> than

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of exposed ores and such a lot more than

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
of exposed ores and such a lot more than
the<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:04.589> method<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> see

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the little two by two method that I see

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
the little two by two method that I see
a<00:01:05.519> lot<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.729> people<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.110> some<00:01:07.140> TNT

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
a lot of people do it does take some TNT

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.510 
a lot of people do it does take some TNT
but<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.280> doesn't<00:01:08.700> take<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> much<00:01:10.520> see

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
but it really doesn't take that much see

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.170 
but it really doesn't take that much see
even<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> caves<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.510> mad<00:01:13.130> anyway<00:01:14.130> I'll<00:01:14.580> get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
even the caves are mad anyway I'll get

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
even the caves are mad anyway I'll get
to<00:01:15.540> showing<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.960> guys<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.470> new<00:01:16.770> method

right now alright now in order to do

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
right now alright now in order to do
this<00:01:21.090> mining<00:01:21.420> technique<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.290> easy<00:01:22.590> all

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this mining technique it's so easy all

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
this mining technique it's so easy all
you<00:01:22.950> need<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> few<00:01:23.520> torches<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> pickaxe<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you need is a few torches a pickaxe a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
you need is a few torches a pickaxe a
lever<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:26.040> TNT<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.360> only

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
lever and some TNT I'm actually only

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200 
lever and some TNT I'm actually only
going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> use<00:01:27.930> two<00:01:27.990> TNT<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.770> example<00:01:29.210> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
going to use two TNT in this example but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to use two TNT in this example but
basically<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> little

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
basically what you do is you do a little

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.620 
basically what you do is you do a little
dig<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.970> by<00:01:36.119> two<00:01:36.180> square

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
dig in and just do the one by two square

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
dig in and just do the one by two square
just<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.590> normally<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just like how will you normally with

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.210 
just like how will you normally with
strip<00:01:38.369> mine<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.600> dig<00:01:39.869> back<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.740> two

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
strip mine and just dig back one two

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.719 
strip mine and just dig back one two
three<00:01:41.909> four<00:01:42.450> five<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:44.369> place<00:01:44.520> another

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
three four five and just place another

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.010 
three four five and just place another
torch<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.619> keep<00:01:46.920> doing<00:01:47.399> this

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
torch and you can just keep doing this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
torch and you can just keep doing this
for<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.049> long<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.850> make<00:01:50.850> sure<00:01:50.880> that

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
with your TNT exploding incorrectly and
then<00:02:20.590> what<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.069> want<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.310> do<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.580> as<00:02:21.819> you're

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
then what you want to do is as you're

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.880 
then what you want to do is as you're
coming<00:02:22.330> out<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.660> your<00:02:22.810> strip<00:02:23.050> mine<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.709> just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
coming out of your strip mine you just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.160 
coming out of your strip mine you just
start<00:02:24.069> placing<00:02:24.340> cobblestone<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
start placing cobblestone like that and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 
start placing cobblestone like that and
every<00:02:26.380> time<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.830> come<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.190> torch<00:02:27.430> pick

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
every time that you come to a torch pick

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.940 
every time that you come to a torch pick
up<00:02:27.910> your<00:02:28.090> torch<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.569> place<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.020> TNT<00:02:29.440> right<00:02:29.830> in

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
up your torch and place a TNT right in

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550 
up your torch and place a TNT right in
front<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.700> like<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.380> can

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
front of it just like that and you can

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.620 
front of it just like that and you can
do<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.860> for<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.310> know<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.640> long<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.360> want

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
do this for you know as long as you want

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.770 
do this for you know as long as you want
and<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:36.220> what<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.000> next<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.480> just

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
and then what you do next is you just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.479 
and then what you do next is you just
place<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> lever<00:02:38.440> right<00:02:38.980> here

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
place a lever right here

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.699 
place a lever right here
after<00:02:39.910> you've<00:02:40.030> capped<00:02:40.390> off<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:41.230> strip<00:02:41.530> mine

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
after you've capped off your strip mine

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.190 
after you've capped off your strip mine
and<00:02:42.269> flick<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> TNT<00:02:44.890> will<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.220> on

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and flick it then the TNT will go on

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.820 
and flick it then the TNT will go on
we'll<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.530> nice<00:02:47.800> long<00:02:48.600> tunnel<00:02:49.830> going

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
we'll have this nice long tunnel going

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.280 
we'll have this nice long tunnel going
all<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.489> way<00:02:51.519> back<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.810> where<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.140> basically

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
all the way back to where we basically

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.020 
all the way back to where we basically
stopped<00:02:53.800> mining<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.850> we've

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
stopped mining but you can see we've

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.590 
stopped mining but you can see we've
uncovered<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.860> lot<00:02:56.860> more<00:02:57.130> ore<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.390> would

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
uncovered a lot more ore that we would

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960 
uncovered a lot more ore that we would
have<00:02:58.690> otherwise<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.500> not<00:02:59.800> seen<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.670> we<00:03:00.819> did

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
have otherwise just not seen and we did

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.699 
have otherwise just not seen and we did
it<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> lot<00:03:01.269> quicker<00:03:01.480> than<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.080> had<00:03:02.230> done<00:03:02.470> a

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
it a lot quicker than if we had done a

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.330 
it a lot quicker than if we had done a
whole<00:03:03.459> bunch<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.850> strip<00:03:04.180> mining<00:03:04.950> tunnels<00:03:05.950> now

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
whole bunch of strip mining tunnels now

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.819 
whole bunch of strip mining tunnels now
I<00:03:06.700> know<00:03:06.760> TNT<00:03:07.269> for<00:03:07.930> some<00:03:08.170> people<00:03:08.470> may<00:03:08.650> be<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
I know TNT for some people may be a

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.770 
I know TNT for some people may be a
little<00:03:08.980> bit<00:03:09.130> difficult<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.549> get<00:03:09.730> but<00:03:10.600> if<00:03:10.690> you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
little bit difficult to get but if you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.940 
little bit difficult to get but if you
think<00:03:11.019> about<00:03:11.140> it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
think about it

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.140 
think about it
creepers<00:03:12.489> drop<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:13.950> about<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.370> T&amp;T<00:03:15.820> on

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
creepers drop know about to T&amp;T on

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.170 
creepers drop know about to T&amp;T on
average<00:03:16.600> maybe<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:18.040> know<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:18.489> you're<00:03:18.760> really

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
average maybe you know if you're really

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.500 
average maybe you know if you're really
unlucky<00:03:19.450> they'll<00:03:19.870> only<00:03:20.019> drop<00:03:20.290> one<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.799> average

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
unlucky they'll only drop one on average

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.630 
unlucky they'll only drop one on average
but<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.200> killing<00:03:23.530> only<00:03:23.980> five

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
but that's like killing only five

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.050 
but that's like killing only five
creepers<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.720> then<00:03:26.709> going<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.880> desert

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
creepers and then going to the desert

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.819 
creepers and then going to the desert
and<00:03:28.360> killing<00:03:28.989> some<00:03:29.230> sand<00:03:29.560> -<00:03:30.359> but<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.840> really

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and killing some sand - but it really

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.900 
and killing some sand - but it really
has<00:03:33.220> made<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.489> very<00:03:33.820> nice<00:03:34.239> neat<00:03:34.720> tunnel<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
has made a very nice neat tunnel and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.050 
has made a very nice neat tunnel and
it's<00:03:36.910> exposed<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.810> lot<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.290> ore<00:03:38.590> for<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.790> amount

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's exposed a lot of ore for the amount

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.890 
it's exposed a lot of ore for the amount
of<00:03:40.120> effort<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:40.750> had<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.989> put<00:03:41.140> into<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:42.900> now

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
of effort that we had to put into it now

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.300 
of effort that we had to put into it now
you<00:03:44.320> may<00:03:44.470> be<00:03:44.500> wondering<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.040> know<00:03:45.100> why

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you may be wondering you know why

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.250 
you may be wondering you know why
exactly<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.359> working<00:03:46.870> why<00:03:47.019> are<00:03:47.079> we

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
exactly is this working why are we

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.949 
exactly is this working why are we
getting<00:03:47.350> these<00:03:47.680> nice<00:03:48.420> 3x3<00:03:49.420> tunnels

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
getting these nice 3x3 tunnels

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.729 
getting these nice 3x3 tunnels
well<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.910> probably<00:03:52.570> easiest<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:53.350> show

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
well it's probably easiest to just show

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.940 
well it's probably easiest to just show
you<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.450> go<00:03:55.630> ahead<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:56.230> place<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> TNT

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
you so if I go ahead and I place a TNT

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.490 
you so if I go ahead and I place a TNT
right<00:03:57.430> here

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
right here

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.670 
right here
and<00:03:58.890> then<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> light<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.210> up<00:04:00.510> we're<00:04:01.500> going<00:04:01.620> to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and then I light it up we're going to

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.260 
and then I light it up we're going to
see<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.950> shape<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.460> makes<00:04:04.640> alright<00:04:05.640> so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
see the shape that it makes alright so

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.850 
see the shape that it makes alright so
what<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.050> see<00:04:07.230> here<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:07.590> have<00:04:07.830> a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
what we can see here is we have a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.220 
what we can see here is we have a
perfect<00:04:08.660> three<00:04:09.660> by<00:04:10.380> three<00:04:10.770> by<00:04:11.040> three<00:04:11.460> cube<00:04:12.230> now

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
perfect three by three by three cube now

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.750 
perfect three by three by three cube now
you're<00:04:13.320> probably<00:04:13.470> thinking<00:04:13.770> alright<00:04:14.460> then

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
you're probably thinking alright then

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.729 
you're probably thinking alright then
and<00:04:14.970> we've<00:04:15.060> got<00:04:15.210> a<00:04:15.240> 3<00:04:15.480> by<00:04:15.510> 3<00:04:15.660> by<00:04:16.049> 3<00:04:16.290> cube<00:04:16.760> but<00:04:17.760> why

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
and we've got a 3 by 3 by 3 cube but why

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.710 
and we've got a 3 by 3 by 3 cube but why
is<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.980> next<00:04:20.250> T<00:04:20.400> being<00:04:20.880> set<00:04:21.150> off<00:04:21.180> if<00:04:21.420> it's<00:04:21.570> only

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
is the next T being set off if it's only

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.160 
is the next T being set off if it's only
3<00:04:21.959> by<00:04:22.109> 3<00:04:22.260> by<00:04:22.470> 3<00:04:22.680> cube<00:04:23.180> well<00:04:24.180> it's<00:04:24.420> because<00:04:24.780> if

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
3 by 3 by 3 cube well it's because if

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.230 
3 by 3 by 3 cube well it's because if
you<00:04:25.410> think<00:04:25.710> about<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.250> right<00:04:26.730> here's<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> T

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
you think about it right here's the T

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.740 
you think about it right here's the T
and<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.750> blows<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.410> this<00:04:28.830> whole<00:04:29.070> area<00:04:29.600> but<00:04:30.600> we

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and it blows up this whole area but we

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.870 
and it blows up this whole area but we
also<00:04:30.960> have<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:32.100> air<00:04:32.690> going<00:04:33.690> from<00:04:34.230> here<00:04:34.880> to

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
also have some air going from here to

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.110

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.120 
will blow up and now as the blast is
coming<00:04:56.190> through<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.730> air<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.300> this<00:04:57.419> T<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.810> T

it<00:04:59.130> might<00:05:00.140> blow<00:05:01.140> up<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:02.280> ring<00:05:02.669> right<00:05:02.910> here<00:05:03.150> as

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
it might blow up this ring right here as

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.270 
it might blow up this ring right here as
well

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
well

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.760 
well
now<00:05:05.669> there's<00:05:06.000> only<00:05:06.540> about<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:08.600> 50/50<00:05:09.600> chance

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
now there's only about a 50/50 chance

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.870 
now there's only about a 50/50 chance
it's<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.919> little<00:05:11.130> bit<00:05:11.250> higher<00:05:11.370> than<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.669> but

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
it's a little bit higher than that but

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.969 
it's a little bit higher than that but
for<00:05:12.300> all<00:05:12.419> intents<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:12.780> purposes<00:05:12.870> it's<00:05:13.380> 50/50

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
for all intents and purposes it's 50/50

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.070 
for all intents and purposes it's 50/50
that<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.220> blows<00:05:14.400> up<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:14.820> ring<00:05:15.120> right<00:05:15.300> here

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.409 

but<00:05:19.080> then<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.470> next<00:05:19.680> TT<00:05:20.400> blast<00:05:20.760> goes<00:05:21.030> off<00:05:21.240> and

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
but then the next TT blast goes off and

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.300 
but then the next TT blast goes off and
it<00:05:21.540> blows<00:05:21.690> up<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.960> 3x3<00:05:22.440> area<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:22.979> comes<00:05:23.190> back

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
it blows up a 3x3 area and it comes back

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.810 
it blows up a 3x3 area and it comes back
through<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.360> same<00:05:24.600> tunnel<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:26.370> will<00:05:26.610> have

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
through the same tunnel and it will have

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.650 
through the same tunnel and it will have
a<00:05:26.880> 50/50<00:05:27.750> chance<00:05:27.780> of<00:05:28.290> blowing<00:05:28.650> up<00:05:29.120> this<00:05:30.120> ring

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
a 50/50 chance of blowing up this ring

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.409 
a 50/50 chance of blowing up this ring
as<00:05:30.810> well<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.260> what<00:05:31.620> you'll<00:05:31.860> get<00:05:32.100> is<00:05:32.430> most<00:05:33.120> of

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
as well and what you'll get is most of

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.900 
as well and what you'll get is most of
the<00:05:33.540> time<00:05:34.310> you'll<00:05:35.310> have<00:05:35.790> these<00:05:36.650> stone<00:05:37.910> the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
the time you'll have these stone the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.830 
the time you'll have these stone the
stone<00:05:39.590> blown<00:05:40.590> away<00:05:40.950> by<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.610> tnt<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.750> know

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
stone blown away by the tnt you know

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.890 
stone blown away by the tnt you know
every<00:05:43.350> once<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.710> while<00:05:43.740> you'll<00:05:44.160> have<00:05:44.370> a

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
every once in a while you'll have a

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.909 
every once in a while you'll have a
straggler<00:05:45.900> like<00:05:46.169> you<00:05:46.290> know<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.710> tunnel

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
straggler like you know in this tunnel

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.850 
straggler like you know in this tunnel
we<00:05:47.100> may<00:05:47.250> have<00:05:47.370> one<00:05:47.640> right<00:05:47.820> here<00:05:47.880> that<00:05:48.419> just

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
we may have one right here that just

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.830 
we may have one right here that just
didn't<00:05:49.860> blow<00:05:50.100> up<00:05:50.270> but<00:05:51.270> that's<00:05:51.360> not<00:05:51.570> really

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
didn't blow up but that's not really

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.140 
didn't blow up but that's not really
that<00:05:51.870> bad<00:05:52.200> it's<00:05:52.440> one<00:05:52.770> use<00:05:53.010> out<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.250> your<00:05:53.430> picks

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
that bad it's one use out of your picks

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.210 
that bad it's one use out of your picks
and<00:05:54.600> if<00:05:54.780> you've<00:05:54.930> doing<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:55.890> mining

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
and if you've doing this mining

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.530 
and if you've doing this mining
technique<00:05:56.550> chances<00:05:57.030> are<00:05:57.180> you're<00:05:57.360> going<00:05:57.479> to

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
technique chances are you're going to

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.719 
technique chances are you're going to
get<00:05:57.690> quite<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.110> few<00:05:58.380> diamonds<00:05:58.890> out<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.580> it

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
get quite a few diamonds out of it

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.930 
get quite a few diamonds out of it
because<00:06:00.630> it's<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:01.050> it's<00:06:01.710> really<00:06:02.190> good<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.790> it

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
because it's a it's really good and it

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.330 
because it's a it's really good and it
second<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.720> cave<00:06:03.930> mining<00:06:04.410> it's<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:05.130> best

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
second the cave mining it's the best

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.800 
second the cave mining it's the best
mining<00:06:05.669> technique<00:06:06.120> I've<00:06:06.270> ever<00:06:06.450> seen<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.720> just

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
mining technique I've ever seen I just

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.310 
mining technique I've ever seen I just
don't<00:06:07.169> know<00:06:07.260> why

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
don't know why

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.100 
don't know why
people<00:06:08.980> don't<00:06:09.220> use<00:06:09.430> TNT<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:10.120> mine<00:06:10.360> more<00:06:10.690> often

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
people don't use TNT to mine more often

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.510 
people don't use TNT to mine more often

didn't<00:06:38.080> mention<00:06:38.320> about<00:06:38.380> this<00:06:38.650> is<00:06:38.860> that<00:06:39.070> if<00:06:39.460> you

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
didn't mention about this is that if you

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.920 
didn't mention about this is that if you
build<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:40.000> slow<00:06:40.240> enough<00:06:40.480> to<00:06:40.690> where<00:06:40.810> you're

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
build the slow enough to where you're

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.530 
build the slow enough to where you're
getting<00:06:41.140> lots<00:06:41.260> of<00:06:41.410> diamonds<00:06:41.800> and<00:06:41.950> stuff

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
getting lots of diamonds and stuff

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.660 
getting lots of diamonds and stuff
slimes<00:06:43.540> also<00:06:43.900> will<00:06:44.050> spawn<00:06:44.290> in<00:06:44.320> here<00:06:44.770> as<00:06:45.520> long

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
slimes also will spawn in here as long

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.370 
slimes also will spawn in here as long
as<00:06:45.790> there's<00:06:45.940> enough<00:06:46.150> space<00:06:46.540> for<00:06:46.570> them<00:06:46.990> that<00:06:47.200> is

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
as there's enough space for them that is

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.570 
as there's enough space for them that is
so<00:06:48.130> that's<00:06:48.580> just<00:06:48.670> another<00:06:48.880> reason<00:06:49.420> that<00:06:49.450> this

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
so that's just another reason that this

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.300 
so that's just another reason that this
strip<00:06:51.580> mining<00:06:51.850> design<00:06:52.180> is<00:06:52.450> awesome<00:06:53.310> anyway

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
strip mining design is awesome anyway

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.820 
strip mining design is awesome anyway
until<00:06:55.030> next<00:06:55.510> time<00:06:55.810> this<00:06:56.050> is<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.380> cinnamon

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830
