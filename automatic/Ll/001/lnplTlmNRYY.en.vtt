00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.660 
question how I mounted my cork roadbed
on<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.969> layout<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.309> stuck<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.460> down

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
on the layout how I stuck it down

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.220 
on the layout how I stuck it down
essentially<00:00:16.130> some<00:00:17.130> people<00:00:17.490> use<00:00:17.760> glue<00:00:18.230> some

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
essentially some people use glue some

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000 
essentially some people use glue some
people<00:00:19.650> nail<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.359> well<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.570> decided<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.619> do

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
people nail it well I decided to do

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
people nail it well I decided to do
something<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.850> easy<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:25.580> stapled<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.080> it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
something very easy I stapled it and it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.490 
something very easy I stapled it and it
works<00:00:28.320> totally<00:00:28.760> awesome

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
works totally awesome

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.950 
works totally awesome
just<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> staple<00:00:32.550> gun<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> relatively

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
just get a staple gun with a relatively

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.740 
just get a staple gun with a relatively
wide<00:00:34.410> staple<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.540> one

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
wide staple because if you get one

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
wide staple because if you get one
that's<00:00:36.930> too<00:00:37.200> narrow<00:00:37.530> you'll<00:00:37.890> dimple<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.149> cork

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that's too narrow you'll dimple the cork

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
that's too narrow you'll dimple the cork
and<00:00:39.780> cause<00:00:39.989> problems<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> want<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and cause problems so you want a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.410 
and cause problems so you want a
relatively<00:00:41.969> wide<00:00:42.329> staple<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:45.000> staple

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
relatively wide staple and just staple

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.720 
relatively wide staple and just staple
it<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:46.219> very<00:00:47.219> simple<00:00:48.020> lay<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
it down very simple lay it out and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
it down very simple lay it out and
staple<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> down<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.300> whip<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> bunch<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
staple it down you can whip a bunch of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.000 
staple it down you can whip a bunch of
it<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:52.920> very<00:00:53.370> quickly<00:00:54.620> otherwise<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
try to nail it you end up bending the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
try to nail it you end up bending the
nails<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.000> nightmare<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.780> is

don't want to track there any longer

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
don't want to track there any longer
it's<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.290> easy<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.860> pull<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.610> stick

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's very easy to pull it up just stick

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.760 
it's very easy to pull it up just stick
a<00:01:32.820> screwdriver<00:01:33.210> under<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> staple<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.530> pull

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

it<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.119> easy<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:39.320> also<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> couple<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it out easy as that also a couple of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
it out easy as that also a couple of
other<00:01:40.950> things<00:01:41.549> I'd<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.210> mention<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
other things I'd like to mention on the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
other things I'd like to mention on the
layout<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> did<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.960> one<00:01:46.130> some<00:01:47.130> people

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
layout that I did is one some people

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.319 
layout that I did is one some people
with<00:01:47.820> their<00:01:48.240> Atlas<00:01:48.930> flex<00:01:49.290> track<00:01:49.970> remove<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
with their Atlas flex track remove the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.429 
with their Atlas flex track remove the
ties<00:01:51.829> where<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:53.040> put<00:01:53.250> their<00:01:53.490> rail<00:01:53.729> joiners

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
ties where they put their rail joiners

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.340 
ties where they put their rail joiners
well<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.360> looks<00:01:57.570> ugly<00:01:57.810> because

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
well to me I think it looks ugly because

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
well to me I think it looks ugly because
then<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.460> got<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> match<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.240> tie<00:02:00.479> with<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
then you got to match the tie with a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
then you got to match the tie with a
piece<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.380> wood<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.340> whole<00:02:02.520> lot<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
piece of wood and it's a whole lot of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
piece of wood and it's a whole lot of
extra<00:02:02.969> work<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.810> came<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.600> another<00:02:06.600> easy

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
extra work I came up with a another easy

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.400 
extra work I came up with a another easy
plan<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> zoom<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.140> can

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
plan and I'm going to zoom in so you can

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.610 
plan and I'm going to zoom in so you can
see<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.360> what<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> did<00:02:12.989> let's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
see it what I did let's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.710 
see it what I did let's
how<00:02:13.799> much<00:02:13.980> tighter<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.760> zoom<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.239> before<00:02:15.390> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
how much tighter I can zoom in before it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.820 
how much tighter I can zoom in before it
blurs<00:02:15.959> there<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.440> go

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
blurs there we go

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.990 
blurs there we go
I<00:02:17.269> took<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.780> dremel<00:02:19.430> around<00:02:20.430> where<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> rail

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I took the dremel around where the rail

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.410 
I took the dremel around where the rail
joiner<00:02:21.480> goes<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:23.040> cut<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:23.909> lip<00:02:24.150> off

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
joiner goes and I cut the little lip off

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.809 
joiner goes and I cut the little lip off
that<00:02:25.319> holds<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.860> track<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> therefore<00:02:28.830> you

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
that holds the track so therefore you

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.509 
that holds the track so therefore you
can<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.269> bend<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.810> tie<00:02:31.079> just<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.950> wee<00:02:32.159> little

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
can just bend the tie just a wee little

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.309 
can just bend the tie just a wee little
bit<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.239> slide<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> rail<00:02:33.900> joiner

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
bit and you can slide the rail joiner

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.610 
bit and you can slide the rail joiner
under<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.340> works<00:02:35.549> perfectly<00:02:36.329> fine<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
under and it works perfectly fine you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.130 
under and it works perfectly fine you
have<00:02:37.799> no<00:02:38.129> problems<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.690> can't<00:02:39.959> even

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
have no problems and you can't even

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.229 
have no problems and you can't even
hardly<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.069> joint<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.670> tell<00:02:41.909> that<00:02:42.090> it's

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
hardly see the joint or tell that it's

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.319 
hardly see the joint or tell that it's
there<00:02:42.629> also<00:02:43.409> one<00:02:44.400> other<00:02:44.430> thing<00:02:44.909> I'd<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
there also one other thing I'd like to

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.599 
there also one other thing I'd like to
mention<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.299> corners<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:50.190> avoid

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
mention is on my corners to avoid

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.839 
mention is on my corners to avoid
kinking<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:53.299> staggered<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.510> rail<00:02:54.690> joints

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
kinking I staggered the rail joints

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.940 
kinking I staggered the rail joints
offset<00:02:56.849> them<00:02:57.030> basically<00:02:57.989> what<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> did<00:02:58.440> was<00:02:58.799> I

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
offset them basically what I did was I

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.880 
offset them basically what I did was I
took<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.310> piece<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.730> flex<00:02:59.970> track<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.890> just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
took the piece of flex track and just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.309 
took the piece of flex track and just
bent<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.879> longer<00:03:03.420> rail<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.140> to

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
bent it and the longer rail is going to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.170 
bent it and the longer rail is going to
be<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.769> inside<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.549> course

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
be on your inside of course

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.619 
be on your inside of course
so<00:03:06.930> wherever<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.650> stopped<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:11.510> put<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
so wherever it stopped I just put it

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.539 
so wherever it stopped I just put it
down<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.170> took<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> other<00:03:13.620> rail<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.340> moved

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
down and took the other rail and moved

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.550 
down and took the other rail and moved
it<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.879> other<00:03:15.060> way<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.720> would<00:03:15.870> line<00:03:16.079> up<00:03:16.349> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it the other way so it would line up and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.599 
it the other way so it would line up and
again<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.579> did<00:03:18.359> my<00:03:18.540> little<00:03:18.750> trick<00:03:19.459> with<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
again I did my little trick with the

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.800 
again I did my little trick with the
dremel<00:03:21.060> as<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.440> see<00:03:22.680> there<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:25.340> there

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
dremel as you can see there and there

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.479 
dremel as you can see there and there
and<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> don't<00:03:28.049> even<00:03:28.380> hardly<00:03:28.680> notice<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
and you don't even hardly notice that

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.360 
and you don't even hardly notice that
there's<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.790> joint<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.129> works

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
there's a joint there and it works

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.129 
there's a joint there and it works
perfect<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.200> any<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:36.139> are

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
perfect so any of you out there that are

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.830 
perfect so any of you out there that are
wondering<00:03:37.739> how<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.669> do<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.209> without

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
wondering how you can do that without

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.520 
wondering how you can do that without
removing<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.889> ties<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:43.019> one<00:03:43.260> way<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
removing the ties that is one way you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.849 
removing the ties that is one way you
can<00:03:43.949> certainly<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.699> it<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:46.410> liked<00:03:46.680> it

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
can certainly do it and I liked it

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.300 
can certainly do it and I liked it
because<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.489> relatively<00:03:48.269> easy<00:03:49.129> like<00:03:50.129> I

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
because it was relatively easy like I

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.610 
because it was relatively easy like I
say<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.699> take<00:03:51.120> your<00:03:51.269> dremel<00:03:51.810> tool<00:03:52.109> with

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
say you just take your dremel tool with

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.629 
say you just take your dremel tool with
your<00:03:52.769> cutoff<00:03:53.220> wheel<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.879> ever<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.660> carefully

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
your cutoff wheel and ever so carefully

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.890 
your cutoff wheel and ever so carefully
cut<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.819> plastic<00:03:57.510> tab<00:03:57.810> off<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:59.629> the<00:04:00.629> tie

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
cut that plastic tab off and the tie

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.830 
cut that plastic tab off and the tie
will<00:04:01.230> let<00:04:01.440> go<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.949> the<00:04:02.129> rail<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.940> perfect<00:04:05.840> so

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
will let go of the rail it's perfect so

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.770 
will let go of the rail it's perfect so
hopefully<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.470> answers<00:04:07.949> some<00:04:08.160> questions

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
hopefully that answers some questions

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.670 
hopefully that answers some questions
