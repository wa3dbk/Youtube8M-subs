00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.399
 Anna Borisova native where I learned 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.649
 Turkish I understand apologize there 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.979
 all who talk only personal group 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.080
 languages it is starting with the Kyrgyz of the world 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.769
 that is, no speech to me is absolutely not 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 itâ€™s hard for me 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.370
 rich papa 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.970
 on 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.730
 the fact is that the Tatars are instant 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.069
 twentieth century 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.920
 before that, our little nation 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.470
 Crab was called only this Crimean 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.599
 Turks but not Turks as a rule then you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.180
 take it as if from Turkey is not exactly Turk 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.520
 chock it passed and had to Ottoman 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.530
 empire words are from the time 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.480
 Crimean Khanate called the Crimean 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.769
 Turks, that is, only the linguistic people 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.260
 lived in the Crimea, and in times still Sultanan 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.890
 respect women often went out 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.380
 marry 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.160
 the Turks and so on that is the fee like 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.360
 thing if somebody when not watched 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.640
 series magnificent century 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.290
 you can understand that michael the great 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.170
 Sultan Suleyman was Crimean Tatar 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is Karl iron that is exactly my nation 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.830
 now 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.380
 Crimean Tatar is a little bit 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 distorted name that's just Moscow 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.530
 it's hard to explain to whom that island 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.630
 such a long story so on so therefore 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.459
 how ever you even say there krymsk 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.430
 but somewhere it glorifies that it was donated 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.370
 There paints to well as something so yes in principle 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.900
 right needle and so instead was 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.329
 it's hard to explain to someone I'm just 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.130
 Russian is not always clear at all yes 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.430
 there is a deeper history with the Tatars 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.070
 which is now on hearing we let Pts 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.890
 it looks like a language in principle but honestly 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.640
 I do not understand but that is me much 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.110
 much easier to speak Turkish 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.660
 that is, it seems to me much 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.910
 easier than for example the top on which 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.200
 I create kazan in my big 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.850
 the difference i mean i have to very 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790
 strain a lot of difference 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.850
 in the language and with the Turks we almost 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.450
 we have the same language like 90 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.450
 percent of language 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.310
 not much pride is that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.480
 also for so many years 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.480
 Well, so many problems when so much 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.390
 tragedy 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.600
 he is tired of his knees now 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.180
 very many were born just huge 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.040
 heights 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.740
 has a huge business open my 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.740
 universities and so on i'm mad 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.650
 nice to read a book and count on the back 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.290
 that the author of this book Kislinsky rolled 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.310
 I am pleased that after deportation 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.060
 after a very big one died 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.290
 throwing people unfortunately died and 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.800
 very there we celebrated the vatican 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.870
 violent scenes when these cars 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.180
 beastly reduced to the word just here 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.200
 so they threw out there who died and all that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:58.100
 there is just but crushed the nation and me 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:01.850
 madly gordon the topic that now stayed 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.980
 language I almost wept out when two 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.360
 a day ago I found out that now 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.849
 Crimean Tatar recognize 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.710
 state 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.280
 so here you can say dropped 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.150
 Now we are so tired and even in 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.940
 bruised even if we are a little limp 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.840
 herself on her feet . 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.840
 buffalo 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:35.140
 Now many mothers are not very you are not 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.970
 pay due attention to daughters and me 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.620
 frustrating the fact that many of our girls 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.500
 very much blossomed his vision 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.530
 I'm not talking about the fact that there are clubs 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.480
 what substance years and although to tour of course 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.360
 you can say the same about it 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.280
 behavior when it was not peculiar 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.490
 The girl on our nation is very dough 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.150
 modest which raised and now increasingly 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.020
 and more often i hear something girl ask 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.789
 forgiveness you will see fool well wandered in 16 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.340
 and will not start at the same time you 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.159
 think like this, such a people 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.009
 so what kind of always brought up so 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.650
 strict laws and so on well not me 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.069
 it's frustrating true here she says 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.600
 what do you want to understand the family 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.760
 look at your father 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.700
 if you want to understand the nation do not look at 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.250
 Woman take from us but that is 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.710
 a girl came face to face the suit 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.700
 girl 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.370
 so which nurture children 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.240
 what kind of mother go on this i think 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.069
 what 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.060
 you can still fix this a little bit 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.470
 part 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.470
 but to sculpt 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.210
 yes a few rules like madness 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.030
 vesalium 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.020
 jungling green bogatyr this 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.430
 translated 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:02.840
 the beauty of the face depends on the beauty of the soul 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.840
 so you need to improve yourself from the inside.
