00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.809
 the iphone 6 boxing remembers that if 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.799
 you like technology dale like this 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.799
 video we start 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.300
 well all friends then we are going to 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.449
 start with the unboxing of iphone 6 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.869
 this is the iphone 6 space break that 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.599
 translated literally it would be iphone 6 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.610
 gray space and good let's start 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.170
 let's see the box first in the part 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 in front of us we no longer have the image of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.589
 iphone as before we had nothing more 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.690
 We have the shape of the iphone but it is 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.399
 totally white on the side part 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 it just says iphone no longer says that 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.420
 iphone is and so good in the part of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.659
 back we have the specifications in 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.430
 this case this is 64 gb with that I have 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.439
 more than enough is enough memory 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.379
 they expanded it a lot in the part of to 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:59.540
 same side we have iphone in this case 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.689
 This was brought to me from the USA 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.790
 t-mobile but it's already unlocked and what 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:09.950
 can you buy the 16 gb version is from 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.759
 645 dollars and for the iphone 6 plus what 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.979
 can buy from 745 dollars well 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.950
 now what we all want 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's quickly open the iphone and a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.619
 boy that although we're still going to open it 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.619
 so 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 and now if the moment everyone 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.450
 We expected pa pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.140
 and there is always that fear of not 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:47.890
 nothing will come but there is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.200
 we have the iphone 6 space way there I am 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 I hi how are you how handsome 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 and well, see how quickly because 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.009
 I'll leave it here for a moment 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.409
 let's see what else this box brings 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.149
 good as always the instructive that 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.920
 nobody reads it in fact the iphone was 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.769
 designed for anyone to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.260
 can use no longer bring that thanks 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.170
 they do not put him in this thing for 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.579
 To be able to remove it without or to put the temple very 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.049
 bad and very bad and but good 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.700
 instructive and the classic ones that the 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.069
 community be because they already know from 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.420
 several years ago and well the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.940
 instructive that no one is left 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.860
 they do not have so many things anymore 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.599
 that you that I do not have already are not 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.840
 putting so many things you put it like that 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.640
 just as things are and so good 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.739
 you know what all the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.230
 products point the charger and that 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.970
 is connected to the wall with USB input 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.970
 let's remove the plastic once 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.299
 we have the lightning cable that also 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.900
 let's undress we're not going to take away the 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.900
 plastic 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.290
 there you have it this goes to the wall and this 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.230
 goes to the iphone and we have the bots 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.230
 the famous reports very good I like them 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.849
 enough but these are not going to 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.610
 remove the clothes they give us good and we are going to 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.049
 remove the plastic and let's leave them 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.030
 here because I have others then up 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.769

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.080
 these while we are going to store them in the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.069
 box and let's go with the star of the show 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.189
 that is the iphone 6 the truth they said 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.989
 here is the iphone 6 wow is that of 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.420
 You're really beautiful I do not know if it's because 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.120
 I'm an apple fan, I love the design of 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.459
 the support products or if not yes 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.659

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.639
 Pretty Mr. iPhone 6 is great 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.170
 It's like a galaxy like I said in 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.959
 some my videos is like that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.639
 size more or less and well good like with 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.799
 6 plus is a little bigger this has 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.499
 a 4-point screen 7 inches and its 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.810
 brother the iphone 6 plus has one of 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:52.209
 5.4 a little bit bigger but let's 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.319
 remove the plastic then let's 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.199
 remove the plastic and will remove it 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.120
 fast and then if they already knew me if 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.769
 have seen my other videos will know that 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.989
 I'm pretty paranoid with screens 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.849
 and then then he's going to quickly put a 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.169
 screen saver and then already what 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.079
 I start for the first time but good 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.090
 while we are going to remove the plastic 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.400
 john goes to outside 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.930
 and you also go for something that 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.819
 they will also know if they watch my videos is that 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.470
 I love the smell of these things when 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.239
 They are new I love the smell of the ipad 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.970
 iphone or whatever it is is more up 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.460
 they sucked it offense that the bus does not 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.840
 there is a madman but I love it then 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.850
 good as I said I'm paranoid 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.740
 how many liked it will quickly put the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 screen saver because it is already 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.850
 after a good time trying 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.300
 put it is needed as I heard how 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.699
 it sounds, they do not listen to us but well 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.199
 I finally managed them go faster 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.880
 iphone then there we have it in the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.650
 back of the one thing that I do not 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.110
 love it but I say it does not affect so much 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.540
 these lines here but actually I 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.540
 love the design is very very thin 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.190
 the manzanita now the power button or 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.830
 on is here the top is this 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.840
 here we have nothing and good in the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.940
 another side we have the buttons to upload 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.160
 and lower the volume and the mode 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.520
 vibration and down then the horns 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.690
 microphone and the central lighting I have 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.340
 to do this I have to forgive 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.830
 suck this is that I really 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.990
 love how it smells 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.380
 it's delicious it's the first iphone I make 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.210
 that but now I already taught them 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.400
 let's learn it very fast to see 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.480
 the initial configuration is already 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.480
 trying to learn from here 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.320
 hello hello hello iphone 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.930
 I'm going to put in English I liked to put 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.240
 in English I feel that this is how practical I do not know 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.930
 why but good and no I'm not in 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.840
 USA 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.490
 they are immense we are in mexico 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.249
 I had forgotten let's put the action 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.909
 from my old cell phone at once 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:54.650
 there it is I have one of telcel then 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:57.229
 let's see if it grabs say ou sim 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.740
 soi cheang and in theory he has to grab 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.020
 it is supposed to be unlocked 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.150
 and if not press the chair process what 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.639
 I grab 4g you can also do it to 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.710
 through talking and like that but he did not catch me 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.250
 so now we're going to put him 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.129
 We are in Mexico the months Mexico 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.459
 is 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.809
 and good to connect quickly see now 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:21.819
 we come to the part where he asks us 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:23.860
 if we want the standard view or consume 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.139
 because it has more space 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.669
 I'll put standard here gives you the 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.969
 difference zoom 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.679

 iphone activated wow 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.309
 The good thing is that you already have 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.830
 apple applications we can erase them 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:44.110

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.319
