00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.449
 avoiding this 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.909
 these years that have to do with the defense of g4 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.560

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.510
 obviously d 8 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.359
 totti and del piero 8 are the most natural houses for the tower 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.619
 a potential idea for coats 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:48.559
 with his pawn a4 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:54.379
 in a4 it is trying to try to kill a woman with a5 at some point 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.569

 heavy that I say shot 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.309
 good use of the column even if you tell me and the house f5 for your horse 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.899
 I am not convinced that such a drastic move was necessary 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.459
 but I have the feeling that I will have a great time seeing how the will take place 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.689
 game 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.889
 snow white doors and windows take the pedestrian because of the impending fork 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.150

 the most calm 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 tower f1 is an alternative 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.020

 and the white abandon me 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.219
 a surprising ending to the game 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.839
 kkarp man should have kept everyone together with me seven in black have 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.449
 however, I received the compensation 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.919
