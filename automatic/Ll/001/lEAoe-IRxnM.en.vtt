in<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.470> playoffs<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.760> intensity<00:02:32.209> you're

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
in the playoffs I the intensity you're

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.180

what's<00:02:51.920> what's<00:02:52.250> fun<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.610> watch<00:02:52.700> them<00:02:52.940> run

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630

number one thing on defense we did a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.860

good<00:02:58.610> job<00:02:58.670> tackling<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.480> running<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
good job tackling and running to the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.199 
good job tackling and running to the
ball<00:03:00.160> I'd<00:03:01.160> have<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.489> watch<00:03:01.640> film<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.120> it

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
ball I'd have to watch film but it

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.370 
ball I'd have to watch film but it
looked<00:03:02.360> like<00:03:02.420> we<00:03:02.570> ran<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> ball<00:03:03.110> fairly

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380
