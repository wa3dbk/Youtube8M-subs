it<00:00:24.030> was<00:00:24.330> probably<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> most<00:00:26.580> gory<00:00:26.940> game<00:00:27.270> that

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it was probably the most gory game that

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.750 
it was probably the most gory game that
you<00:00:27.570> could<00:00:27.720> probably<00:00:27.930> get<00:00:30.650> it<00:00:31.650> came<00:00:31.980> out<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
you could probably get it came out it

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.640 
you could probably get it came out it
came<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.150> for<00:00:33.480> more<00:00:33.690> combat<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.290> things<00:00:34.470> like

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
came out for more combat and things like

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.040 
came out for more combat and things like
that<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:36.390> didn't<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.629> have<00:00:36.840> anything

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that so it didn't really have anything

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.400 
that so it didn't really have anything
else<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.379> compare<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.769> to<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> time<00:00:38.460> but

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
else to compare it to at the time but

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.370 
else to compare it to at the time but
it's<00:00:40.410> pretty<00:00:40.559> much<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.850> your<00:00:41.870> Robocop<00:00:42.870> by

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
it's pretty much like your Robocop by

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.280 
it's pretty much like your Robocop by
Ziggler<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.280> massive<00:00:44.640> guns<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
Ziggler with some massive guns and you

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.280 
Ziggler with some massive guns and you
ask<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.800> arrest<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.820> drug<00:00:48.780> dealers<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
ask around arrest in drug dealers and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.130 
ask around arrest in drug dealers and
stopping<00:00:52.290> them<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:53.809> basically<00:00:54.809> selling

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
stopping them from basically selling

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
stopping them from basically selling
drugs<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> kids<00:00:56.040> but<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> whole

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
drugs to kids but I think the whole

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.569 
drugs to kids but I think the whole
premise<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> game<00:00:59.010> was<00:01:01.010> was<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.399> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
premise about the game was was a lot to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.810 
premise about the game was was a lot to
do<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:03.840> big<00:01:04.530> anti-drug<00:01:05.039> campaign<00:01:05.339> that
