00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.100
 the big foreign uni world in all of them 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.899
 courses and options and 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.930
 approval regulations buzzing 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.000
 fast, the head does not turn 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 sure is what he wants to study and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.250
 can be found in the support 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.500
 study counseling confronting each other 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.149
 not at all with the question at all 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.739
 I have a certain subject 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.809
 to study or do I want that 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.190
 actually but only so that the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.660
 I do not get it and that's why I need it 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.160
 I can not continue with mine 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.850
 to deal with own wishes 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.559
 and there I have to start often 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.939
 and say so now we start first 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.590
 completely elsewhere and try 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.029
 find out what they want 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.249
 actually really studying around 

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:11.779
 look at all that 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.369
 find out because then you can first 

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:15.619
 look what's ever again 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.060
 Offside possible around 80 courses 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.340
 offers the bremer uni 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.479
 the choice is not always easy and 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.310
 do not be afraid if it is with the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.159
 Wishing studies nothing becomes sometimes 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.389
 you will find the right one first 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.039
 that you just can not get what you want 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.810
 and so it was with me too 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.270
 At that time I wanted to study biology 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.439
 I tried it, yes I did 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.909
 advertised everywhere I have it unfortunately 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.459
 I did not really want to go after that 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.039
 bremen what made me then 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.959
 me again in bremen to see what 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.549
 it's natural for me 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.409
 would give well and there I am then 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.189
 always met with geoscience 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.770
 I found that and tried 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.299
 and I'm still in it today 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.400
 I am totally happy and it was that 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.390
 actually what I could do 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.310
 auditorium mensa boulevard at the university 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 waiting for a completely new world 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.360
 but there are many offers so that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.110
 freshlings feel at home quickly 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.670
 and their haunt discover the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 Orientation week has a good one 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.880
 helped here just in the first 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.860
 to find their way around 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.200
 there were many posters hung up 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.520
 Students have just helped too 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.100
 if you do not have the timetable yet 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.510
 could properly structure properly and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.090
 even if you have the individual buildings 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
 always wanted to find 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.260
 student is available and have one 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.209
 helped well 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.550
 The lecture is one thing but the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.860
 stomach wants to be filled and live 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.580
 You have to go somewhere around this too 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 the student work cares especially 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.430
 of course, in the food supply there 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
 We are pleased by the statements of 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.580
 golden trays of the bulls 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.290
 have shown how great they are 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.420
 find us 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.580
 the approximately 6000 people are also one 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.260
 Daily evidence of this while living 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.660
 Of course it is important for us 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.190
 to offer housing with less than 200 euros 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.070
 partly for furnished living 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 including all additional costs and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.239
 especially services for 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.769
 handicapped people become small 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.989
 Having a partner is for us 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.480
 a matter of course 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.860
 still ask all the information 's under uni
