00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone is boeing 777 welcome 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.170
 in the best athletic madrid in history 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 of ultimate team using all the cards 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.730
 data makes 10 won 15 however before 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.500
 start as always I remind you of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 put I like this video to have 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.690
 then other episodes of this series 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.760
 other teams from at least 350 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.410
 I like it and then I remind you to comment 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 with signing up another team that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.769
 you would like to see me then I will choose 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.119
 one of all those who will have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 commented with the one determined 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.439
 team the winner will win 5,000 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 credits, however, we start because in this 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.100
 team we really have many 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 strong players and one of the first is the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.190
 first is courtois 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 we start immediately with a porter 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.680
 the overall strong 88 looks at him 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.780
 reflections 92 resumed positioning 89 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 unfortunately one of the strongest goalkeepers 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.430
 last year and it also shows from 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 these very high statistics the fullback 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 left is another team of the season 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.039
 filipe luis is also 87 of a great one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.420
 season 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 I tell you spoilers there are so many but 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 lots of fig tree teams 14 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 however filipe luis 88 of speed is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 defense plus the 86 passages struggled cipe 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
 of dribbling too a great beauty 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.720
 card here this time there are no cards 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.310
 the middle period is scarce and the other is less 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.659
 team of the season other player from 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.900
 cheering 14 so we did the 87 88 and 89 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.060
 and the pigtail a media defender is not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.189
 very fast because 71 also seventh 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.530
 decision goes well it's not a lot though 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.780
 very high in game statistics for 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.689
 the note a central more than 90 of the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 he also defended the 90th header 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.329
 near him miranda from fifa 15 he is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.850
 the only player we have from fifa 15 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.100
 however, he was faster than gooden ma 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.950
 the rest is all under va va well that also 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 even less than 5 overall though 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.479
 great defense that we have only so far e 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.079
 to complete it have another team of the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 season aviv 14 juanfran because miranda 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.960
 ruin 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.780
 we have so far only thyme tesino 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.490
 data makes 14 however juanfran really 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 similar to filipe luis 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 indeed type speed and dribbling are 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.220
 also the same then the rest if it looks like 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 he also high defense 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.989
 high even the passage in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.099
 general also a great fullback 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.230
 in front of the defense says in your opinion 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.700
 what with another bob season 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.950
 exact gavi and we are 5 to 6 5 you show yourself 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.260
 season gabbi statistics that are not 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.690
 not at all low 80 sheets overall also 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.299
 we find the eighty-nine passing type 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.299
 which is good even if it tries to defend then 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.370
 the rest is there is quite average 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.989
 as left exterior we have arda turan 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.920
 he's not a very good guy anyway 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.690
 outside 87 he over the over I love 75 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.690
 of speed therefore not among the fastest 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.880
 however at 90 of dribbling and also the 88 of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.459
 passage would be an outsider to try 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.590
 he is not one of the fast ones we are 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.590
 used to seeing just how it is not 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.049
 here also the 87 he instead of team of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.630
 the season also dribbling 90 then 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.670
 80 speed with a bit faster like 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.650
 better to shoot as better defense 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.320
 but it is not the best passage 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.870
 two externals are the best header 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.549
 a bit strange, that is, not very fast at least 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.280
 but now let's move on to the part 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.019
 offensive of the team because in the derby 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.769
 cheetahs point who cares for everything 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.470
 the team because I am like that 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.510
 forced to put diego costa has it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.100
 said here because otherwise it is not in the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.900
 team because in fact then I have to remove 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.389
 also other players who later do you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.579
 see who for example is seen as how 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.470
 I always say this team and in fact unworkable 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.900
 we put it and we also put it as 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.060
 acts, however , it's okay who cares 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.389
 I want to put the best and he puts it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.280
 because there must be 90 very good with 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.079
 very high statistics like the 92's 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.120
 89 speed shot at 88 of 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.459
 dribbling the 88 head can't 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.040
 put it now that we have the two tips 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.829
 the first is forlan from fifa 10 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.799
 he even 91 yoga roll too 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.140
 he statistics as high as 96 of 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.540
 shooting and speed 86 at 88 of 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.250
 dribbling the 86 head also that 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.690
 player 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.730
 and next to him is the falcao tiger 94 the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.660
 free the highest number player 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.990
 of the team type 96 of head 90 of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.260
 shooting not at very high speed because 83 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.940
 also the dribbling 83 however if you go to 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.760
 see the statistics in game you see that 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.720
 it is an absolute tip that is absurd of 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.370
 absolute 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.560
 here is a text there is all this stuff in the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.750
 team but you know that I have been 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.420
 obliged to keep out I had to keep 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.490
 look outside this aguero here 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.200
 I opened here 89 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.540
 perhaps he would have been better to do 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.980
 unfortunately I had to keep the t 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.080
 outside I put it on the bench for the 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.690
 first time to keep on the bench but 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.580
 at least I wanted to say there wasn't this one 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.590
 therefore to the best athletic madrid of the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.450
 scared story I remind you of 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.950
 recommend me below from another team from 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.780
 do and if you don't know what the picture is 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.090
 no bonate to see anyone there 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.770
 playlist I don't know but it is if video the 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.980
 liked to like my channel 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.980
 and comments from bob 777 all hello to everyone
