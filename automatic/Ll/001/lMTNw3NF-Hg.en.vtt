 TOMIKKU GAME rule description 

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hello everyone! Let us remember the "Tomikku Game" dung game today! 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
 Basically, like the "go to school" (game name) that was popular before, it is a complete imitation of the "rhythm 4 beat game". Just, there are some differences, let’s take a look! 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 TUㄧ 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.700
 TUㄧ 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.800

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:14.800
 TUㄧ 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
 From the very beginning (please pay attention to the movements of the hands. When the two idiots take the third shot, the gestures are swaying to the fourth shot, and raising the hope hand to the sky is very unpleasant) 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.000
 Please keep up with the rhythm (please pay attention to the movements of the hands. When the 2 idiots are making the third shot, when the gesture is swaying to the hem for the fourth shot, it is very uncomfortable to raise the hope hand to the sky) 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Please pay attention to the movement of the hand. When the two idiots took the third shot, the gesture was raised to the bottom of the fourth shot, and the hope of raising the hand to the sky was very unpleasant. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 TOMI * 2 (Please pay attention to the action of the hand. When the 2 idiots are shooting at the third time, when the gesture is slammed to the fourth hem, it is very uncomfortable to raise the hope hand to the sky.)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.800
 Everyone "please advise the sauce on the next movie."
