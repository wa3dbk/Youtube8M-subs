00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
when you eat Tracy you're actually cells

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
fuel so when we don't put the right fuel

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.959 
fuel so when we don't put the right fuel
in<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.979> tricking<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.729> body

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
in we're actually tricking our body

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
in we're actually tricking our body
which<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> why<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> eat<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> diet<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
which is why when you eat a diet like I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
which is why when you eat a diet like I
was<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.219> ringleader<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> was<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
was the ringleader I was like the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
was the ringleader I was like the
cheerleader<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.170> when<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.740> eat<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
cheerleader of it all when you eat a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.709 
cheerleader of it all when you eat a
diet<00:02:05.250> high<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.579> processed<00:02:06.030> food<00:02:06.420> you're

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
diet high in processed food you're

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.089 
diet high in processed food you're
effectively<00:02:07.110> tricking<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.680> body<00:02:07.890> into

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
effectively tricking your body into

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.499

thinking it's full for an hour or two

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.059 
thinking it's full for an hour or two
because<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.959> stomachs<00:02:10.229> full<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
because your stomachs full but then a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.910 
because your stomachs full but then a
couple<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.400> hours<00:02:11.520> later<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.120> know<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
juice fast but for you you had an

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.770 
juice fast but for you you had an
autoimmune<00:02:30.800> disorder<00:02:31.430> disease<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.600> it's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
autoimmune disorder disease and it's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.670 
autoimmune disorder disease and it's
gone<00:02:33.050> now

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
gone now

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.440 
gone now
great<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.370> cured<00:02:34.850> yourself<00:02:34.970> with

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
great so you cured yourself with

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.660 
great so you cured yourself with
vegetable<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.020> allowed<00:02:36.530> my<00:02:36.739> body<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.400> cure

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
vegetable I allowed my body to cure

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.100 
vegetable I allowed my body to cure
itself<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.209> way<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.360> think<00:02:38.480> about<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.050> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
itself is the way I think about it I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.440 
itself is the way I think about it I
instead<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.560> using<00:02:39.890> medication<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.940> treat<00:02:41.209> my

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
instead of using medication to treat my

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.170 
instead of using medication to treat my
condition<00:02:41.510> yeah<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.440> used<00:02:42.890> nutrition<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.060> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
condition yeah I used nutrition to do it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.660 
condition yeah I used nutrition to do it
so<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> difference<00:02:45.650> here<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.430> when

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so so the difference here is that when

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.790 
so so the difference here is that when
you<00:02:46.700> blend<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.930> lot<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.080> people<00:02:48.440> have<00:02:48.620> these

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
you blend and a lot of people have these

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.410 
you blend and a lot of people have these
blenders<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.459> home<00:02:49.580> you're<00:02:50.060> actually

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
blenders at home you're actually

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.240 
blenders at home you're actually
outsourcing<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> chewing<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.069> machine

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
outsourcing the chewing to a machine

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.559 
outsourcing the chewing to a machine
think<00:02:52.790> about<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.180> way<00:02:53.269> because<00:02:53.420> you're

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
think about it that way because you're

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.090 
think about it that way because you're
just<00:02:53.690> taking<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.080> whole<00:02:54.170> produce<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.010> you're

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
just taking the whole produce and you're

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.680 
just taking the whole produce and you're
blending<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.430> up<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.700> love<00:02:56.150> blending<00:02:56.510> it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
blending it up I love blending it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.449 
blending it up I love blending it's
great<00:02:56.930> for<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.319> do<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.069> all<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
great for you I do a lot of that all the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.840 
great for you I do a lot of that all the
time

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
time

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.520 
time
yeah<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> needed<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.049> do<00:03:00.200> was<00:03:00.380> to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
yeah but what I needed to do was to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.620 
yeah but what I needed to do was to
supercharge<00:03:01.190> my<00:03:01.459> micro<00:03:01.940> nutrient<00:03:02.299> intake<00:03:02.540> I

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
supercharge my micro nutrient intake I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.940 
supercharge my micro nutrient intake I
wanted<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.900> get<00:03:03.019> all<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.380> captured

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
wanted to get all of that captured

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.250 
wanted to get all of that captured
sunlight<00:03:04.400> into<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.209> body<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.630> as<00:03:05.720> much<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.019> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
sunlight into my body and as much of it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.170 
sunlight into my body and as much of it
as<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.440> could<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.280> best<00:03:07.549> way<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:08.030> that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
as I could and the best way to do that

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.020 
as I could and the best way to do that
is<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.600> juice<00:03:08.900> because<00:03:09.440> via<00:03:09.830> juicing<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.850> can

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
is to juice because via juicing we can

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.550 
is to juice because via juicing we can
actually<00:03:11.180> take<00:03:11.510> all<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:11.930> produce<00:03:12.380> and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
actually take all of this produce and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
think I think the thing is Tracy what I

love<00:04:00.650> people<00:04:00.859> at<00:04:01.040> home<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.220> think<00:04:01.370> about<00:04:01.790> this

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
love people at home to think about this

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270 
love people at home to think about this
is<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.630> why<00:04:02.870> do<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.200> have<00:04:03.380> this<00:04:03.500> ability<00:04:03.859> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
is that why do we have this ability to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.099 
is that why do we have this ability to
put<00:04:04.640> on<00:04:04.760> all<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.090> weight<00:04:05.329> okay

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
put on all this weight okay

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.780 
put on all this weight okay
the<00:04:06.410> reason<00:04:06.799> is<00:04:06.950> where<00:04:07.130> our<00:04:07.250> bodies<00:04:07.670> are

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
the reason is where our bodies are

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.729 
the reason is where our bodies are
holding<00:04:08.239> on<00:04:08.359> to<00:04:08.390> stored<00:04:08.780> energy<00:04:08.959> thinking

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
holding on to stored energy thinking

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.530 
holding on to stored energy thinking
there's<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.040> famine<00:04:10.430> coming<00:04:10.760> because<00:04:11.150> we<00:04:11.299> come

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
there's a famine coming because we come

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.729 
there's a famine coming because we come
from<00:04:11.569> a<00:04:11.750> long<00:04:11.930> history<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.260> feast<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.709> famine

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
from a long history of feast and famine

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.470 
from a long history of feast and famine

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
yeah so I would love people instead of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.719 
yeah so I would love people instead of
think<00:04:14.780> about<00:04:15.019> oh<00:04:15.170> my<00:04:15.350> god<00:04:15.560> I'm<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:15.889> fat<00:04:16.190> think

through a healthy balanced diet is

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.410 
through a healthy balanced diet is
rebuild<00:04:55.370> that<00:04:55.460> muscle<00:04:55.790> I'll<00:04:55.880> put<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.090> muscle

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
rebuild that muscle I'll put the muscle

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.760 
rebuild that muscle I'll put the muscle
back<00:04:56.540> on<00:04:56.750> because<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> definitely<00:04:57.230> want<00:04:57.710> that

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
back on because you definitely want that

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.770 
back on because you definitely want that
muscle<00:04:58.190> absolutely<00:04:58.730> critical<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.270> day<00:04:59.750> three

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
muscle absolutely critical so day three

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.770 
muscle absolutely critical so day three
of<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> whole<00:05:01.340> experience<00:05:01.780> you're

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
of the of the whole experience you're

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.750 
of the of the whole experience you're
you're<00:05:03.440> not<00:05:03.470> feeling<00:05:03.980> good<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.340> felt<00:05:04.550> like<00:05:04.730> a

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
you're not feeling good I felt like a

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.490 
you're not feeling good I felt like a
truck<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.240> run<00:05:05.300> item<00:05:05.600> yeah<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.110> part<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.440> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
truck and run item yeah but part of the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.020 
truck and run item yeah but part of the
reason<00:05:06.770> why<00:05:06.890> is<00:05:06.950> because<00:05:07.100> people<00:05:07.670> are<00:05:07.790> eating

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
reason why is because people are eating

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.060 
reason why is because people are eating
around<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.840> there's<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.110> big<00:05:09.320> social<00:05:09.650> tie

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
around you so there's a big social tie

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.830 
around you so there's a big social tie
to<00:05:10.130> eating<00:05:10.730> people<00:05:11.060> eat<00:05:11.210> around<00:05:11.510> you<00:05:11.660> you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
to eating people eat around you you

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.500 
to eating people eat around you you
smell<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.230> barbecue<00:05:12.800> your<00:05:13.730> families<00:05:14.270> get

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
smell the barbecue your families get

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.000 
smell the barbecue your families get
together<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.260> all<00:05:15.380> based<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:15.740> food

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
together and it's all based on food

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.920 
together and it's all based on food
before<00:05:16.520> we<00:05:16.820> actually<00:05:16.970> make<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.270> shake<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.720> want

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
before we actually make a shake I want

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.450 
before we actually make a shake I want
to<00:05:18.080> tell<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.530> want<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:18.920> to<00:05:19.010> tell<00:05:19.190> everyone

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
to tell I want you to tell everyone

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.340 
to tell I want you to tell everyone
psychologically<00:05:20.300> how<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.450> get<00:05:20.660> past<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.050> so

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
psychologically how you get past that so

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.190 
psychologically how you get past that so
the<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.730> way<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.150> were<00:05:23.450> always<00:05:23.780> thinking<00:05:24.080> about

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
the the way I were always thinking about

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.330 
the the way I were always thinking about
it<00:05:24.440> was<00:05:24.560> that<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.800> was<00:05:24.920> taking<00:05:25.220> medication

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
it was that I was taking medication

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.700 
it was that I was taking medication
night<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.180> day<00:05:26.330> this<00:05:26.540> was<00:05:26.720> my<00:05:26.870> last<00:05:27.170> throw<00:05:27.680> of

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
night and day this was my last throw of

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.160 
night and day this was my last throw of
the<00:05:27.860> dice<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:28.310> figured<00:05:28.940> that<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.300> had<00:05:29.540> turned<00:05:29.960> my

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
the dice I figured that I had turned my

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.750 
the dice I figured that I had turned my
back<00:05:30.320> on<00:05:30.380> Mother<00:05:30.680> Nature<00:05:30.770> I<00:05:31.190> wanted<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.610> run

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
back on Mother Nature I wanted to run

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.950 
back on Mother Nature I wanted to run
towards<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.390> see<00:05:32.600> whether<00:05:32.720> she<00:05:32.840> would

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
towards it and see whether she would

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.140 
towards it and see whether she would
open<00:05:33.230> her<00:05:33.320> arms<00:05:33.350> up<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:33.980> kill<00:05:34.190> me<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:34.820> anybody

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
open her arms up and kill me so anybody

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.970 
open her arms up and kill me so anybody
who's<00:05:35.570> just<00:05:35.840> doing<00:05:36.110> this<00:05:36.200> for<00:05:36.410> weight<00:05:36.560> loss<00:05:36.770> is

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
who's just doing this for weight loss is

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.710 
who's just doing this for weight loss is
most<00:05:37.250> likely<00:05:37.550> going<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:37.790> fail<00:05:38.000> because<00:05:38.480> the

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
most likely going to fail because the

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.260 
most likely going to fail because the
power<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.380> wanting<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.890> E<00:05:39.920> is<00:05:40.310> way<00:05:40.610> more<00:05:40.910> than

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
power of wanting to E is way more than

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.030 
power of wanting to E is way more than
actually<00:05:41.570> losing<00:05:41.900> those<00:05:42.050> pounds<00:05:42.470> but<00:05:42.890> if

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
actually losing those pounds but if

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.920 
actually losing those pounds but if
you're<00:05:43.250> wanting<00:05:43.520> to<00:05:43.670> do<00:05:43.970> this<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.720> live<00:05:44.900> a
