00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hi everyone so today we 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 find himself for a john hayes live so 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.819
 it's not my life because I had 15 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.529
 years and I have all life in front of me 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.820
 we agree, but I wanted 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.290
 tell you about what happened rather 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.150
 what's been going on for a year and a half 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 for me since sometimes I talk about it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.420
 in my videos so it seemed like a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.609
 not logical to tell you this so that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 you understand better and also like you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.700
 have probably noticed it I draw 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.320
 very very bad so here we go 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.320
 [Music] 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.660
 so I was born on June 4, 1999 I am 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 so geminos and I was born in the south 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.840
 close to toulouse 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 [Music] 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.309
 so I'm going to talk about the primary and the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.750
 college very quickly since that's 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.969
 not really that I wanted to tell you 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.409
 at the base but good luc ilife syndrome 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.120
 I still talk about that 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.070
 primary it was going pretty well I had 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.659
 of pretty good note even though I was doing 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.879
 practically nothing in the covers all 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.300
 the primary way it's really 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.479
 simple 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.479
 [Music] 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 and the collage in 6th 5th I told myself 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.660
 but what am I doing here as a game 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.270
 frankly I am and hamburg day I 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.380
 do not really have school and I 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.180
 remember that at first I had good 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.160
 notes but we took that as you see 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780
 on the stairs that a little tumble 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:30.180
 we'll say 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:31.410
 [Music] 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.790
 so when I was in sixth sixth 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.010
 throw in his jules college had 600 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 people and tale 4th I decided 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.180
 to go in a collage a little more 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 small where there were 100 people that's 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 a private college to try to me 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.180
 crop music does not really serve you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.609
 market 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.609
 [Music] 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.700
 so far it was fine except that towards 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.410
 March 2013 so in the middle of 4th I 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 started to ache when breathing like 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.890
 if you press your lungs 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 well I let two or three pass 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.150
 days but I was getting worse 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.750
 so I went to the hospital and that's 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.750
 there that it all started 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.770
 [Music] 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.090
 they made me exams and very quickly 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.340
 they found cancer 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.560
 precisely the scenic that a cancer of the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 blood and if I had trouble breathing is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.380
 just because I had blast 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.380
 who pressed him the bonuses 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.380
 so when I was told about my illness I 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.940
 remember that I knew that I had a 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.750
 cancer but that I did not realize 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.610
 really actually 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.349
 and it helped me a lot because when I 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.180
 realized I was already in the middle and 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.860
 So I really did not have time to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.959
 tide managed it really helped me with 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.459
 this show my illness he also me 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 said that throughout the duration of 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.430
 treatment at the hospital can be more 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.620
 really going out I was going to have 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 often more humanitarian defenses and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.550
 that I was going to be an apesi of the shot all 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.500
 what he meant to say I was a little 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.760
 cut off from the world and fight over school 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.470
 [Music] 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.360
 the first five weeks I am 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.010
 stayed hospitalized I started my 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.439
 chemo and if there that I started to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.629
 to make my hair then there by cons 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.640
 that's the thing I had more trouble with 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.140
 cash but with time I got 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.430
 by the way we certainly want but 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.540
 sir pro I found that pretty 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.080
 funny 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.250
 [Music] 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.170
 I also started taking 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.819
 cortisone at very high dose and I can 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.980
 tell you that this one she will have everything 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.319
 did I start inflating because that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.240
 holds water from a body so I had 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.770
 the face always flows and it was 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.720
 so weird and you will also see 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.220
 in the south of the video that this 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.260
 cortisone will have made other beautiful 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.410
 comic that I have not cash at all 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.030
 besides also in July I am 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.010
 stayed practically a month in the room 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.780
 sterile so without being able to get out of my 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.250
 room so it really was not 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.450
 easy but I got there anyway 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:04:03.600
 and luckily by the way 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:05.280
 [Music] 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.770
 so it lasted like this until May 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.480
 2014 it was still about the same 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.670
 so I always went back and forth 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.510
 between home hospital hospital house 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.670
 in short actually this year has really 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.630
 been intense for me he also taught me 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.820
 a lot of things 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.290
 I was lucky to be surrounded again 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.480
 family and that helped me a lot 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.480
 [Music] 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.510
 so in may 2014 I started taking 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.130
 a maintenance treatment by hiding that 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.260
 I always take from elsewhere and as 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.260
 you can see it on my videos 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.919
 hair came back so that for me that 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.040
 has no price 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.150
 here I was it was a year that I was a 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.150
 little the own gentleman I have you 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.960
 said and suddenly my hair does not have any 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.340
 price school then end of June I left 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.470
 ten days in Corsica with the hospital 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.240
 I did the south of Corsica sailing 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.440
 we were sleeping on it and I found that 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.660
 it was really a nice reward 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.700
 for everything I've been through for 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.110
 the other children from elsewhere and it has me 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.460
 really change the ideas and it was 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 really but magical then in the autumn 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.910
 with one per year we moved to 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.470
 start from scratch and I resumed 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.600
 course stronger than ever in a 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.030
 new establishment of the coup but there is 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.919
 a very small problem you remember the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.840
 cortisone since I told you do 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.790
 a lot of misfortune he but there it is 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.320
 so since early August despite that 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.669
 I take it down she flatly 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.919
 screw up both sleeves 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.020
 so I have osteonecrosis for those who 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.600
 know and when I filmed 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.440
 the video I did not know at all 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.160
 how long is eastern time a 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.289
 armchair 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.120
 what we would do etc but 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.800
 since I shot this video share 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.990
 I know I will be operated on 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.620
 January 14 for a pretty operation 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.390
 heavy 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.560
 so that will not be 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.479
 impact on my channel but hey 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.400
 you 'll talk about it in another video 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.289
 I think and from now on down 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.940
 I have for more than six months two 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.490
 armchairs which is still pretty 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.930
 huge I actually find what I 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.310
 retain this year 2010 and who can 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.960
 always keeping the head up 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.370
 whatever happens it's useless to 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.539
 to feel sorry for himself 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.400
 almost always kept smiling 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.229
 during that year and it has me 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.090
 a lot helped i get out more often 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.090
 even says it's a finite moment yet 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.570
 I'm lucky enough to be on youtube 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.460
 and it's also partly thanks to this 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.350
 small community that I advance all 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.060
 days that you really allow me to 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.610
 to express myself through what I like to do 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.730
 and that's just magic I want to 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.730
 say 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.400
 so here I hope you 'll like 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.380
 this video even if it's not really 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.900
 very happy but here I am on 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.310
 youtube I do not know I have a little without 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.560
 to share something with you so 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.110
 here I was not thinking that this video 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.030
 will you go back so many memories 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.370
 Here it is really totally 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.620
 of emotion and passage that I have 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.419
 lived or that I lived badly but that's so 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.360
 that's how I do lots of big 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:04.229
 kisses and I 'll tell you the next 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.229
