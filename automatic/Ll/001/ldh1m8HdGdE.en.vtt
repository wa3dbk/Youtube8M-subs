in particular let's straighten it and I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.670 
in particular let's straighten it and I
do<00:02:59.100> some<00:02:59.640> contemporary<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.050> my<00:03:01.170> passion<00:03:01.590> is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.800 

and<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.460> reason<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.060> continue<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> do

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and the reason that I continue to do

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.780 
and the reason that I continue to do
this<00:03:24.840> even<00:03:25.170> though<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.770> seems<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.610> world

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
this even though it seems like the world

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.150 
this even though it seems like the world
is<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.630> shifted<00:03:28.080> over<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.410> hip-hop<00:03:28.650> and

multiple functions in the brain and it

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
multiple functions in the brain and it
it<00:05:02.550> creates<00:05:02.850> a<00:05:02.880> more<00:05:03.060> intelligent<00:05:03.360> person<00:05:03.840> now
