00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of 30% chance to get an item when we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.440 
of 30% chance to get an item when we
kill<00:01:04.260> an<00:01:04.350> elite<00:01:04.700> after<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.060> I'll<00:01:06.180> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
kill an elite after that then I'll just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
kill an elite after that then I'll just
take<00:01:06.750> whatever<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> end<00:01:07.950> up

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
take whatever and if we do end up

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 
take whatever and if we do end up
getting<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> Tier<00:01:08.760> three<00:01:09.409> then<00:01:10.409> we'll

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
getting like a Tier three then we'll

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240 
getting like a Tier three then we'll
confront<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> issue<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.250> but

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
confront that issue when we get to but

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
confront that issue when we get to but
it's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.119> main<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.659> main<00:01:15.810> challenge<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's the main the main challenge of this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
it's the main the main challenge of this
run<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:18.350> inherent<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.860> base<00:01:20.430> item<00:01:20.759> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
run is inherent in the base item that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
run is inherent in the base item that
were<00:01:21.240> allowed<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.229> only<00:01:22.619> item<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> we're

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
were allowed to the only item that we're

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.300 
were allowed to the only item that we're
allowed<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> pick<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> tier<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.720> section

allowed to pick up in a tier one section

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.030 
allowed to pick up in a tier one section
obviously<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:27.570> presents<00:01:27.750> some<00:01:28.229> inherent

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
obviously that presents some inherent

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.150 
obviously that presents some inherent
