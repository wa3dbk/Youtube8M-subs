really<00:00:57.429> i<00:00:57.460> think<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:57.850> when<00:00:58.000> they<00:00:58.120> then<00:00:58.390> it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
really i think that's when they then it

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.119 
really i think that's when they then it
started<00:00:58.899> off<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.289> it's<00:00:59.440> probably<00:00:59.620> sort<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.039> the

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
started off so it's probably sort of the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.919 
started off so it's probably sort of the
eighteen<00:01:00.429> nineteen<00:01:00.789> hundred<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.750> really

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
eighteen nineteen hundred and it really

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.259 
eighteen nineteen hundred and it really
became<00:01:02.260> just<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.039> matter<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.699> transport<00:01:04.210> for

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
became just a matter of transport for

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.390 
became just a matter of transport for
that<00:01:04.629> for<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.839> students<00:01:05.320> getting<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.830> car<00:01:06.070> from
