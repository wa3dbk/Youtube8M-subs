00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.989
 Now another explosive begins. 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.399
 today we are going to check out one of the first science fiction films of 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.300
 Cinema's history 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.449
 Imagine Lula 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.370
 What is an adaptation of the book by the writer Jules Verne and directed by 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.180
 jorginho 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 Nothing special father of the effects 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.060
 in the film a process convinces fellow scientists to sponsor a trip to the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.320
 moon 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.200
 are hijacked by the following inhabitants of the place this desistÃªncia 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 having as pixinguinha 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 But this time I managed to escape. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670
 back to the big screen 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.010
 go to the depths of the oceans 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 to make an exploration of the place before returning to be considered heroes 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.430
 places 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.870
 the appointment of positions would not represent a large differential 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.220
 for the season 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 since the movies used to be more concrete 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.880
 various elements increased the value of the work one of them is the fact that a man 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.440
 finally reach the street in 1969 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 can the films be monitored 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.720
 anticipating the future centenaries 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.090
 and the artists they have more sensitivity than a kilo 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.700
 who has 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.430
 are still in the year in which it was addressed - the question in the field of ufology 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.220
 the crisis 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.870
 beings of other planets a scene in which it followed from something that we do not have 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.919
 certainty that there is 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.069
 beyond the constant need of exploitation of man 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.759
 seeking to expand their horizons and uncover unknown territories 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.979
 on the other hand we can also reserve the aggressiveness of scientists who want 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.140
 levels 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.000
 this proves that from an early age on the characteristics of hundreds of men and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 women every 100 thousand 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.050
 next week 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.050
 I invite you to know the first to the west of the history of 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.019
 movie theater 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.219
 grant hill with the decree 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.209
 It still ends here. 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.269
 but suggestions for - yes @ much bigger network counts on 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.309
 blunt 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.149
 until next week
