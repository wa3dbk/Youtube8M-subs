some<00:04:56.210> of<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.360> concepts<00:04:56.840> in<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.020> middle<00:04:57.260> zone

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
some of the concepts in the middle zone

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:07.659 
some of the concepts in the middle zone
principle

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.649 

and<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.759> think<00:05:08.970> where<00:05:09.090> this<00:05:09.240> helps<00:05:09.539> your

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
and I think where this helps your

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.540 
and I think where this helps your
coaches<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.199> now<00:05:10.319> you<00:05:10.379> got<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.919> fast<00:05:11.280> flow

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
coaches and now you got that fast flow

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.820 
coaches and now you got that fast flow
action<00:05:12.000> by<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.330> back<00:05:12.569> so<00:05:13.139> it's<00:05:13.319> very<00:05:13.439> similar

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
action by that back so it's very similar

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.580 
action by that back so it's very similar
to<00:05:13.949> outside<00:05:14.430> zone<00:05:15.030> but<00:05:15.210> again<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.020> track
