that needs to be knocked on properly
before<00:04:01.610> it's<00:04:01.819> fitted<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.610> should<00:04:04.849> do

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
before it's fitted and that should do

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.180 
before it's fitted and that should do
the<00:04:05.150> job<00:04:05.180> quite<00:04:05.690> well<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:08.440> just<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.709> confirm
