00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.360
 the windsurfer sarah hÃ©bert was 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.920
 present at the meeting it was recalled that 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.360
 damsel has challenged herself a little 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.150
 crazy a few months ago 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.470
 cross the Atlantic in windsurfing even 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.600
 if she could not go after 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.650
 hat down and we took the opportunity to 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.939
 come back with her on her adventure 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.369
 unionized all day for six to 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.380
 eight hours a day and a catamaran me 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.849
 followed at a distance and I join and the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.250
 evening to sleep his kata and the 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.480
 next day at the first hour I 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.850
 felt on my board and so I 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.140
 spent my days with single mothers with 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.670
 a single small mas in landmarks when we go 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.879
 launch an adventure like this 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.879
 we really risk his life since there my 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.579
 security depend and above all of my 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.690
 ability to communicate with my crew 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.730
 declines bhf 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.039
 and so you do not have to get into it 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.109
 at random you really have to be ready 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.059
 physically and even under these conditions 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.059
 there we still take big risks 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.939
 me it is above all the weather and have 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.540
 like all records and it's always 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.090
 a difficult to manage parameter you can 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.229
 to know the weather in 4 1 day 7 days 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.759
 but it can always change 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.350
 that's what happened to me with 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.060
 a wind that has turned to the east and so 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.500
 I was full wind 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.570
 full wind behind windsurfing 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.190
 it's extremely physical and see 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.560
 really impossible to hold as 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.970
 speaking position of that so I have everything 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.430
 given all given I sailed for 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.530
 twelve days 20 hours a day and then 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.390
 one morning I went to the water with 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.679
 loss of consciousness all of the vision 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.259
 I simply reached my limits 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.899
 physical I have come to the end 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.369
 from what I could give I realized 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.759
 my dream I will remember it just 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.759
 Manicamp 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040
