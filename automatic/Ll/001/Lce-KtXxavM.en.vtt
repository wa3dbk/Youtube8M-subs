00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.000
 thanks 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.350
 Thomas Häßler warmed himself in Kaiserslautern Prof as always was there 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.679
 the playmaker with the fifth yellow card locked does not matter 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.579
 The door has already made it to the wm-kader, now he wanted to 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.660
 also in the qualifiers for the Champions League as a good spirit on the bench 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.669
 one point had to come, but the 90 minutes were before shortly before the break 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.739
 Daniel Hoffmann examined optimization of the legs 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.760
 Philipp Hauß gave a penalty and for Hoffmann the yellow card in the package 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
 the duel was called it now 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 Bosler against Hoffmann 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
 and the winner was called 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.630
 911 held 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.390
 immediately thereafter applied 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.850
 the chances lived on 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.030
 right after the change then that for Hoffmann he suffered one 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 adductor tear 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.090
 Hoffmann came for Hoffmann but was caught cold 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 Corner Barcelona 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 what did they have with the chest the one to zero for Lautern Hofmann did not have 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.790
 once the ball 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.850
 The lion should run out of breath so close to the finish 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.800
 No, the 67 d minute brought the decision 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.930
 Max on Prosenik's back on Max and he's ballads 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.229
 Own goal Basler Sack the statistics do not care 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.969
 the sixties brought the so-longed-for points in lutes and qualified 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.040
 Congratulations on international football 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.310
 We think we'll be very happy with what he's saying 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550
 Riddle and that morning of the 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.550
 So the judges are so big at the moment to be there 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.760
 he wanted to qualify for the Champions League and the l and 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.750
 the fire 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.980
 this is required but that 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.190
 no one had been because it would have expected 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.229
 To date, the team has been a lot of fun and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.379
 as far as want and should
