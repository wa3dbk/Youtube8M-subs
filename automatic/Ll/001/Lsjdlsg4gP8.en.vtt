00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
protection around the area meaning that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.729 
protection around the area meaning that
no<00:00:53.760> mobs<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.239> spawn<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> trunk<00:00:55.350> that

no mobs could spawn in the trunk that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
no mobs could spawn in the trunk that
the<00:00:55.890> safe<00:00:56.100> zone<00:00:56.280> block<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> placed<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the safe zone block is placed in and you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.880 
the safe zone block is placed in and you
should<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> mobs<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.379> spawn<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
should see at the mobs will spawn and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.090 
should see at the mobs will spawn and
arrange<00:00:59.460> away<00:01:00.030> from<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> block<00:01:00.690> itself<00:01:01.100> now

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
arrange away from the block itself now

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
arrange away from the block itself now
on<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.760> models<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.090> totally<00:01:03.510> foolproof<00:01:03.690> he

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
on the models are totally foolproof he

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
on the models are totally foolproof he
saw<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> few<00:01:04.830> spawning<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> area<00:01:05.939> itself

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
saw a few spawning in the area itself

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330 
saw a few spawning in the area itself
but<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> should<00:01:06.689> block<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> range<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.040> five

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
but it should block with a range of five

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
but it should block with a range of five
on<00:01:08.640> each<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> very<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:10.110> mod<00:01:10.350> if

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
on each side now it's a very good mod if

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
on each side now it's a very good mod if
you<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.920> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
don't want to use commands to completely

using you know our commands and all
those<00:01:51.750> pesky<00:01:52.049> coordinates<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> put<00:01:53.159> in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
those pesky coordinates I have to put in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
those pesky coordinates I have to put in
and<00:01:53.509> piling<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> area<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.049> such<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.680> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and piling the area and such it's just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.530 
and piling the area and such it's just
easy<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.549> simple<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.939> place<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
easy very simple you place down the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
easy very simple you place down the
block<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.990> mob<00:01:58.140> stop<00:01:58.439> spawning<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
block and the mob stop spawning and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
block and the mob stop spawning and
that's<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.729> trunk<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.810> said<00:02:00.869> not

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that's our trunk but like I said not

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.959 
that's our trunk but like I said not
foolproof<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.829> hopefully<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> guys<00:02:02.579> enjoyed

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
foolproof but hopefully you guys enjoyed
