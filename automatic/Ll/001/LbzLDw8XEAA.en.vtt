00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
not actually do a new iphone this year

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.979 
not actually do a new iphone this year
in<00:00:52.860> 2011<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.550> may<00:00:53.670> wait<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> 2012<00:00:54.750> well

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

in 2011 they may wait to 2012 well
here's<00:00:55.230> soldiers<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> don't

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
here's soldiers take them on it I don't

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
here's soldiers take them on it I don't
think<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.879> case<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.539> apple<00:00:57.989> will

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
think that's the case I think apple will

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.380 
think that's the case I think apple will
update<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.590> iphone<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.579> year<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.180> may

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
update the iphone this year now we may

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.599 
update the iphone this year now we may
not<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> brand<00:01:01.109> new<00:01:01.230> total<00:01:01.680> redesign<00:01:01.949> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
not see a brand new total redesign but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
not see a brand new total redesign but
we'll<00:01:02.760> least<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> same<00:01:03.480> type<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> jump

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
we'll least see the same type of jump

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
we'll least see the same type of jump
from<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> iphone<00:01:04.739> 3g<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> 3gs<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.570> the

from the iphone 3g to the 3gs with the
iphone<00:01:07.080> 4<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.740> call<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> iphone

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
iphone 4 and it will call it the iphone

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.219 
iphone 4 and it will call it the iphone
4s<00:01:09.270> i'm<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> call<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.049> for

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
4s i'm just going to call it that for

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
4s i'm just going to call it that for
this<00:01:10.320> video<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.070> we'll<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.610> Apple<00:01:11.909> mean

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this video but we'll see that Apple mean

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
this video but we'll see that Apple mean
I<00:01:12.119> overall<00:01:12.600> changed<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> design<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> 44

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I overall changed the design and I 44

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
I overall changed the design and I 44
they<00:01:14.520> probably<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.909> change<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> internals

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they probably just change the internals

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
they probably just change the internals
they'd<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.110> give<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.470> dual-core<00:01:16.799> a5

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
they'd probably give it a dual-core a5

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
they'd probably give it a dual-core a5
processor<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.909> more<00:01:18.060> RAM<00:01:18.270> similar<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> the

with<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> next<00:01:34.200> update<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.220> may<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with this next update but that may be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069 
with this next update but that may be
part<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> reason<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:36.659> may<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
part of the reason why they may need to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.530 
part of the reason why they may need to
wait<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> 2012<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> still<00:01:39.030> strongly<00:01:39.299> think

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
wait to 2012 but I still strongly think

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.090 
wait to 2012 but I still strongly think
we'll<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.229> update<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> iphone

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
4 at least by the fall time frame were

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.960 
4 at least by the fall time frame were
right<00:01:43.439> before<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> holidays<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.850> least

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
right before the holidays that at least

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
right before the holidays that at least
updates<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> internals<00:01:45.930> profits<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
updates the internals profits so this is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
updates the internals profits so this is
just<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.100> prediction<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just my little prediction for it but

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899 
just my little prediction for it but
again<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:49.229> reason<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.890> Apple<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> happen

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
again another reason for Apple to happen

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
again another reason for Apple to happen
to<00:01:51.119> wait<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> normal<00:01:52.530> June<00:01:52.829> July<00:01:53.220> time

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
to wait from the normal June July time
