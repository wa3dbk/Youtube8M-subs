than<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.090> iPhone<00:02:06.509> 5<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.920> one

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
than the iPhone 5 so that's one

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.930 
than the iPhone 5 so that's one
advantage<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> iPhone<00:02:09.750> 5c<00:02:10.200> but

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
advantage going for the iPhone 5c but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.680 
advantage going for the iPhone 5c but
you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.780> dimensions

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
you can see that the dimensions

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.380 
you can see that the dimensions
but<00:02:14.020> different<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.520> what<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.060> exact

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
but different so what the exact

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
but different so what the exact
dimension<00:02:16.900> differences<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.980> we'll<00:02:18.460> let<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
dimension differences are we'll let you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.570 
dimension differences are we'll let you
know<00:02:18.940> right<00:02:19.210> now<00:02:19.450> all<00:02:19.900> right<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.430> see

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
know right now all right so you can see

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.180 
know right now all right so you can see
that<00:02:21.820> they<00:02:22.210> look<00:02:22.420> almost<00:02:22.780> exactly<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.160> same

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that they look almost exactly the same

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.820 
that they look almost exactly the same
but<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:25.480> minor<00:02:25.660> differences<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.560> Phi

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
but there are minor differences the Phi

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.570 
but there are minor differences the Phi
is<00:02:27.360> 128<00:02:29.310> 123<00:02:30.360> 0.8<00:02:31.360> millimeters<00:02:31.900> tall<00:02:32.580> while

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
is 128 123 0.8 millimeters tall while

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.260 
is 128 123 0.8 millimeters tall while
the<00:02:33.730> iPhone<00:02:34.060> 5c<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:35.580> 124<00:02:36.580> point<00:02:36.970> four

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
the iPhone 5c is 124 point four

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.630 
the iPhone 5c is 124 point four
millimeters<00:02:37.480> tall<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.710> 0.6<00:02:39.460> millimeters

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
millimeters tall just 0.6 millimeters

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.000 
millimeters tall just 0.6 millimeters
difference<00:02:40.390> between<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> two<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.230> if<00:02:41.860> you

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
difference between the two and if you

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.160 
difference between the two and if you
can<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> thickness<00:02:42.910> too<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.630> higher

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
can see that the thickness too is higher

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.660 
can see that the thickness too is higher
on<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:45.040> iPhone<00:02:45.520> 5c<00:02:46.330> which<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.460> seven<00:02:48.460> point

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
on the iPhone 5c which is seven point

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.750 
on the iPhone 5c which is seven point
six<00:02:49.120> millimeters<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.320> five<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.980> eight

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
six millimeters on the five and eight

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.210 
six millimeters on the five and eight
point<00:02:52.180> nine<00:02:52.570> seven<00:02:52.960> millimeters<00:02:53.590> thick<00:02:53.860> on

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
point nine seven millimeters thick on

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.820 
point nine seven millimeters thick on
the<00:02:54.280> 5c<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.450> difference<00:02:56.020> is<00:02:56.320> not<00:02:56.530> that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
the 5c the difference is not that

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.310 
the 5c the difference is not that
apparent<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.640> camera<00:02:58.090> or<00:02:58.270> in<00:02:58.510> person<00:02:58.870> but

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
apparent on the camera or in person but

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.470 
apparent on the camera or in person but
that's<00:02:59.530> due<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.100> curved<00:03:00.400> back<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:01.300> can

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
that's due to the curved back you can

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480 
that's due to the curved back you can
see<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.990> lot<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.380> difference<00:03:02.830> when<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.100> look<00:03:03.370> at

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
see a lot of difference when I look at

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.390 
see a lot of difference when I look at
this<00:03:03.790> way<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.840> iPhone<00:03:05.380> 5c<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.830> definitely

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
this way the iPhone 5c is definitely

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.610 
this way the iPhone 5c is definitely
taller<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.200> thicker<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.840> also<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> bit

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
taller and thicker and also it is a bit

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.150 
taller and thicker and also it is a bit
wider<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.400> see<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:13.000> slight<00:03:14.160> edges

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
wider you can see the slight edges

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.390 
wider you can see the slight edges
coming<00:03:15.820> out<00:03:15.970> when<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.510> keep<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.990> on<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.070> top<00:03:18.250> of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
coming out when I keep it on the top of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.120 
coming out when I keep it on the top of
each<00:03:18.520> other<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.630> width<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.290> also<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:20.890> it's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
each other so the width is also but it's

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.370 
each other so the width is also but it's
a<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.550> minor<00:03:22.000> difference<00:03:22.570> 0.6<00:03:23.200> millimeters

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
a very minor difference 0.6 millimeters

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.680 
a very minor difference 0.6 millimeters
fifty<00:03:24.340> eight<00:03:24.430> point<00:03:24.700> six<00:03:24.880> millimeters<00:03:25.150> width

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
fifty eight point six millimeters width

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.160 
fifty eight point six millimeters width
on<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.989> five<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.620> fifty<00:03:27.489> six<00:03:27.900> fifty<00:03:28.900> nine

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
on the five and fifty six fifty nine

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.670 
on the five and fifty six fifty nine
point<00:03:29.440> two<00:03:29.680> millimeters<00:03:30.130> width<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.180> 5c<00:03:31.750> so

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
point two millimeters width on the 5c so

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.040 
point two millimeters width on the 5c so
yeah<00:03:32.800> that's<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.550> big<00:03:33.820> difference<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.420> with

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
yeah that's the big difference and with

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.840 
yeah that's the big difference and with
the<00:03:35.260> difference<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.830> build<00:03:36.130> quality<00:03:36.580> comes

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the difference in build quality comes

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.290 
the difference in build quality comes
the<00:03:37.060> difference<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.630> weight<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:39.220> iPhone<00:03:39.730> 5<00:03:40.000> is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
the difference in weight the iPhone 5 is

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.890 
the difference in weight the iPhone 5 is
ridiculously<00:03:41.050> less<00:03:41.860> heavy<00:03:42.280> than<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:43.480> iPhone

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
ridiculously less heavy than the iPhone

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.240 
ridiculously less heavy than the iPhone
5c<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.700> iPhone<00:03:46.150> 5s<00:03:46.450> 112<00:03:47.230> grams<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.769> weight<00:03:47.950> and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
5c the iPhone 5s 112 grams in weight and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.009 
5c the iPhone 5s 112 grams in weight and
the<00:03:48.820> iPhone<00:03:49.330> 5c<00:03:49.959> is<00:03:50.970> 132<00:03:51.970> grams<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.600> weight<00:03:52.750> so

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
the iPhone 5c is 132 grams in weight so

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.830 
the iPhone 5c is 132 grams in weight so
20<00:03:53.880> grams<00:03:54.880> difference<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.620> on<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
20 grams difference you can see on the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.729 
20 grams difference you can see on the
iPhone<00:03:58.840> 5c<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:01.360> aluminium<00:04:01.630> conducts<00:04:02.590> so

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
iPhone 5c so the aluminium conducts so

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:03.720 
iPhone 5c so the aluminium conducts so
that's<00:04:02.950> why<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.190> touch<00:04:03.430> screen

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
that's why the touch screen

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.600 
that's why the touch screen
automatically<00:04:04.450> got<00:04:04.769> enabled<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.250> anyway

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
automatically got enabled so anyway

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.120 
automatically got enabled so anyway
that's<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.570> main<00:04:07.780> difference<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.470> build<00:04:08.890> and

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
that's the main difference in build and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.370 
that's the main difference in build and
dimensions<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.420> iPhone<00:04:10.810> 5<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.320> the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
dimensions of the iPhone 5 and the

dimensions of the iPhone 5 and the
iPhone<00:04:11.680> 5c<00:04:12.540> another<00:04:13.540> major<00:04:13.810> difference

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
iPhone 5c another major difference

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.170 
iPhone 5c another major difference
between<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.739> 5<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> Phi<00:04:15.580> C<00:04:15.850> is<00:04:16.030> the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
the Phi C will have 25 hours more

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.780 
the Phi C will have 25 hours more
standby<00:04:23.979> time<00:04:24.190> than<00:04:24.520> the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
standby time than the

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.570 
standby time than the
fight<00:04:24.990> defy<00:04:25.990> has<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.410> 25<00:04:26.890> hours<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.250> standby

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
fight defy has to 25 hours of standby

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.610 
fight defy has to 25 hours of standby
time<00:04:27.790> when<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.090> Phi<00:04:28.330> C<00:04:28.570> has<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.810> be<00:04:29.020> hours<00:04:29.440> of

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
time when the Phi C has to be hours of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.990 
time when the Phi C has to be hours of
standby<00:04:29.890> then<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.340> that's<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.850> difference

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
standby then so that's the difference

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.470 
standby then so that's the difference
between<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:32.020> two<00:04:32.170> rest<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.920> them<00:04:33.300> exactly<00:04:34.300> the

much<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.110> mean<00:05:02.140> they<00:05:02.950> both<00:05:03.160> are<00:05:03.400> at<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.520> same

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
much I mean they both are at the same

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.170 
much I mean they both are at the same
brightness<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:05.220> not<00:05:06.220> much<00:05:06.490> difference<00:05:06.970> at<00:05:07.090> all

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180

the<00:05:07.660> Phi<00:05:07.870> C<00:05:08.080> has<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.290> sim<00:05:08.500> card<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.950> doesn't<00:05:09.250> so

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the Phi C has a sim card it doesn't so

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.100 
the Phi C has a sim card it doesn't so
that's<00:05:09.730> why<00:05:09.910> you're<00:05:10.060> missing<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.510> carrier

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
that's why you're missing a carrier

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.040 
that's why you're missing a carrier
button<00:05:11.500> here<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:12.730> anyway<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.540> internals

button here but anyway the internals

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.240

also<00:05:14.380> are<00:05:14.590> same<00:05:14.860> Apple<00:05:15.310> a6<00:05:15.790> on<00:05:16.000> both<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:17.250> every

bit of the internals including the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.620 
bit of the internals including the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
same on the 5c as the iPhone 5s the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.420 
same on the 5c as the iPhone 5s the
build<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.050> weight<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.220> thickness

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
build and the weight and the thickness

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.410 
build and the weight and the thickness
that's<00:05:27.850> different

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
that's different

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.450 
that's different
including<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.140> height<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.620> width<00:05:29.860> in<00:05:30.130> very

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
including the height and width in very

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.330 
including the height and width in very
minimal<00:05:30.880> quantities<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.620> that's<00:05:32.950> about<00:05:33.190> it

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
minimal quantities so that's about it

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.490 
minimal quantities so that's about it
for<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.610> differences<00:05:34.090> between<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.720> iPhone<00:05:35.200> 5

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500
