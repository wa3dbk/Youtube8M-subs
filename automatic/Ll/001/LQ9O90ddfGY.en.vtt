00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
working on was the sensor system that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
then with that sensor system we use that

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.130 
then with that sensor system we use that
to<00:01:57.190> target<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.940> missiles<00:01:58.540> on<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.810> onboard

it<00:02:07.060> really<00:02:07.270> reduces<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.140> amount<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.649> work

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
it really reduces the amount of work

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.889 
it really reduces the amount of work
that<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.190> pilot<00:02:09.580> has<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.729> Duke<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
that the pilot has to Duke so the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.650 
that the pilot has to Duke so the
ability<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.500> do<00:02:12.250> other<00:02:12.580> tasks<00:02:13.030> while<00:02:13.450> you're

flying<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.140> aircraft<00:02:14.500> has<00:02:14.890> gone<00:02:15.250> up

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
flying the aircraft has gone up

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.720 
flying the aircraft has gone up
tremendously<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.650> other<00:02:17.830> big<00:02:18.070> advantage<00:02:18.580> is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
tremendously the other big advantage is

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.270 
tremendously the other big advantage is

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
and to the space program it was a very

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.400 
and to the space program it was a very
different<00:06:01.560> base<00:06:01.860> back<00:06:02.130> at<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.490> time<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.410> we

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
different base back at that time and we

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.320 
different base back at that time and we
had<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.980> was<00:06:05.100> a<00:06:05.130> very<00:06:05.340> interesting<00:06:05.700> time<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.180> be
