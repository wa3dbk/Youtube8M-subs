now<00:00:08.780> we're<00:00:08.960> going<00:00:09.080> to<00:00:09.170> look<00:00:09.260> at<00:00:09.410> what<00:00:09.590> we've

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
now we're going to look at what we've

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.070 
now we're going to look at what we've
packaged<00:00:10.280> as<00:00:10.549> the<00:00:11.000> instant<00:00:11.450> effects<00:00:11.780> which

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
packaged as the instant effects which

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.959 
packaged as the instant effects which
are<00:00:12.200> kind<00:00:12.320> of<00:00:12.469> on<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:12.620> left<00:00:12.889> hand<00:00:13.070> side<00:00:13.190> of<00:00:13.790> the

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
are kind of on the left hand side of the

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.970 
are kind of on the left hand side of the
mix<00:00:14.180> here<00:00:14.330> now<00:00:15.019> these<00:00:15.170> are<00:00:15.350> very<00:00:15.530> similar<00:00:15.860> to

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
mix here now these are very similar to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.490 
mix here now these are very similar to
that<00:00:16.250> of<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.490> CFX<00:00:17.480> or<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.869> color<00:00:18.080> effects

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
that of the CFX or the color effects

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.100 
that of the CFX or the color effects
that<00:00:18.680> we<00:00:18.800> had<00:00:18.980> on<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.160> djm<00:00:19.640> 800<00:00:19.790> but<00:00:20.750> again<00:00:20.990> we

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
that we had on the djm 800 but again we

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.200 
that we had on the djm 800 but again we
kind<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.439> relabeled<00:00:22.070> them<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.340> re-engineered

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
kind of relabeled them and re-engineered

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.050 
kind of relabeled them and re-engineered
them<00:00:23.419> it's<00:00:24.410> kind<00:00:24.560> of<00:00:24.710> work<00:00:24.919> again<00:00:25.310> in<00:00:25.520> more<00:00:25.970> of

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
them it's kind of work again in more of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.600 
them it's kind of work again in more of
a<00:00:26.149> studio<00:00:26.599> stroke<00:00:27.050> DJ<00:00:27.500> kind<00:00:27.770> of<00:00:27.919> manner<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:28.489> a

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
a studio stroke DJ kind of manner and a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.630 
a studio stroke DJ kind of manner and a
lot<00:00:28.759> more<00:00:28.910> subtle<00:00:29.509> again<00:00:30.340> okay<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:31.460> on<00:00:31.520> the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
lot more subtle again okay it's on the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.750 
lot more subtle again okay it's on the
djm<00:00:32.000> 800<00:00:32.119> if<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:33.020> were<00:00:33.140> using<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.829> fex<00:00:34.520> like<00:00:34.730> a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
djm 800 if you were using a fex like a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.639 
djm 800 if you were using a fex like a
high-pass<00:00:35.149> filter<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> low-pass<00:00:36.020> filter<00:00:36.469> on

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
high-pass filter a low-pass filter on

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.119 
high-pass filter a low-pass filter on
the<00:00:37.250> pots<00:00:37.850> here<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.719> would<00:00:38.840> have<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.290> put<00:00:40.040> it

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
the pots here you would have to put it

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.349 
the pots here you would have to put it
at<00:00:40.219> twelve<00:00:40.429> o'clock<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.910> then<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.149> get<00:00:41.329> a

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
at twelve o'clock and then you get a

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.419 
at twelve o'clock and then you get a
high<00:00:41.539> pass<00:00:41.809> filter<00:00:42.289> or<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.559> low<00:00:42.739> pass<00:00:42.949> filter

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
high pass filter or a low pass filter

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.329 
high pass filter or a low pass filter
now<00:00:44.089> on<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.329> djm<00:00:44.719> 2000<00:00:45.410> they<00:00:45.620> all<00:00:45.769> work<00:00:46.039> from

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
now on the djm 2000 they all work from

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.849 
now on the djm 2000 they all work from
the<00:00:46.429> left<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.910> right<00:00:47.120> principle<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.230> all<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
the left to right principle so all the

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.430 
the left to right principle so all the
way<00:00:48.949> up<00:00:49.359> very<00:00:50.359> similar<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.660> how<00:00:50.809> Adalind<00:00:51.289> eat

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
way up very similar to how Adalind eat

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.380 
way up very similar to how Adalind eat
these<00:00:51.649> air<00:00:51.859> filters<00:00:52.309> completely<00:00:52.909> from<00:00:53.179> left

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
these air filters completely from left

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.430 
these air filters completely from left
right<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.890> what<00:00:55.129> we<00:00:55.249> can<00:00:55.399> do<00:00:55.550> now<00:00:55.699> if<00:00:55.940> we<00:00:56.089> engage

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
right so what we can do now if we engage

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.079 
right so what we can do now if we engage
hpf<00:00:57.440> which<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.859> high-pass<00:00:58.249> filter<00:00:58.760> and

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
hpf which is a high-pass filter and

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.240 
hpf which is a high-pass filter and
engage<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.289> cot<00:01:01.690> we<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:02.870> our<00:01:02.989> filter<00:01:03.530> now

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
engage the cot we get our filter now

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.710 
engage the cot we get our filter now
with<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.489> parameter<00:01:04.940> button<00:01:05.180> at<00:01:05.300> minimum

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
with the parameter button at minimum

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.570 
with the parameter button at minimum
it's<00:01:06.020> kind<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.380> more<00:01:06.530> like<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.740> sweeper<00:01:07.370> bleak

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
it's kind of more like a sweeper bleak

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.240 
it's kind of more like a sweeper bleak
you<00:01:11.230> but<00:01:12.230> if<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.410> increase<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.040> parameter

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
you but if you increase the parameter

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.450 
you but if you increase the parameter
pot<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:14.630> kind<00:01:14.900> of<00:01:15.190> introduces<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.220> bit<00:01:16.370> of

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
pot this kind of introduces a bit of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.890 
pot this kind of introduces a bit of
resonance<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.120> bit<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.390> crack<00:01:17.660> on<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
resonance in a bit of a crack on the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.050 
resonance in a bit of a crack on the
filter<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.160> can<00:01:19.280> get<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:19.820> nice

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
filter so you can get a really nice

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.610 
filter so you can get a really nice
attached<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.780> shelf<00:01:21.080> point<00:01:21.410> on<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
attached to the shelf point on the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.610 
attached to the shelf point on the
knitter<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.370> on<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.910> filter<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:24.440> if<00:01:24.500> you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
knitter on the on the filter so if you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.170 
knitter on the on the filter so if you
pull<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.220> all<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.370> way<00:01:25.460> around<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.970> fits

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
pull it all the way around and that fits

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.450 
pull it all the way around and that fits
all<00:01:32.390> works<00:01:32.600> exactly<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.050> same<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.680> LPF<00:01:34.190> which

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
all works exactly the same for LPF which

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.970 
all works exactly the same for LPF which
is<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.670> low-pass<00:01:35.030> filter<00:01:35.510> so<00:01:36.260> lots<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:36.620> attack

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
is a low-pass filter so lots of attack

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.760 
is a low-pass filter so lots of attack
now<00:01:37.250> I'm<00:01:37.400> introduced<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:39.170> can<00:01:39.350> really<00:01:39.650> hit

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
now I'm introduced it you can really hit

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
now I'm introduced it you can really hit
any<00:01:39.890> attack<00:01:40.190> there

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.020 

now<00:01:46.509> if<00:01:46.570> we<00:01:46.659> turn<00:01:46.869> all<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.170> way<00:01:47.200> get<00:01:47.560> down<00:01:48.030> more

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
now if we turn all the way get down more

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.459 
now if we turn all the way get down more
of<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.149> sweet<00:01:49.390> bubble<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.780> do<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.110> this<00:01:53.289> also

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
of a sweet bubble you do so this also

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.130 
of a sweet bubble you do so this also
works<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.219> jets<00:01:54.579> which<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.600> kind<00:01:55.869> of<00:01:55.960> like

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
works for a jets which is kind of like

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.800 
works for a jets which is kind of like
maybe<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.799> phaser<00:01:57.280> or<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.789> flanger<00:01:58.390> kind<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.689> like

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
maybe a phaser or a flanger kind of like

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.340 
maybe a phaser or a flanger kind of like
a<00:01:58.840> nice<00:02:00.149> spatial<00:02:01.149> sweep<00:02:01.569> over<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:02.020> top<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.289> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
a nice spatial sweep over the top of the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.719 
a nice spatial sweep over the top of the
truck<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> get<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.649> quite<00:02:05.979> quite<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.520> lot<00:02:06.700> of

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
truck so get this quite quite a lot of

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.719 
truck so get this quite quite a lot of
attack<00:02:07.030> there<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.539> can<00:02:07.659> just<00:02:08.670> turn<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
attack there but you can just turn that

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.220 
attack there but you can just turn that
down<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.269> quite<00:02:13.569> clearly<00:02:13.599> me

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
down but then you can quite clearly me

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.900 
down but then you can quite clearly me
here<00:02:14.739> if<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.930> turn<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.019> all<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> way<00:02:17.319> up<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
here if we turn that all the way up so

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
here if we turn that all the way up so
pioneer<00:02:22.329> all<00:02:22.540> our<00:02:22.810> own<00:02:23.019> worst<00:02:23.049> enemy

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
pioneer all our own worst enemy

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
pioneer all our own worst enemy
sometimes<00:02:23.829> sometimes<00:02:24.519> our<00:02:24.670> effect<00:02:25.000> sound<00:02:25.269> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
sometimes sometimes our effect sound it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.940 
sometimes sometimes our effect sound it
amazing<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:25.959> sometimes<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:26.799> would

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
amazing but sometimes you know we would

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
amazing but sometimes you know we would
be<00:02:26.980> kind<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.579> killed<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.150> nice<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.540> produce

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
be kind of killed it's nice and produce

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.470 
be kind of killed it's nice and produce
tracks<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.410> sizes<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.370> big<00:02:30.610> attacking<00:02:31.269> wet

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
tracks in sizes this big attacking wet

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.380 
tracks in sizes this big attacking wet
effect<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.290> yea<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> ability<00:02:33.730> against

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
effect so yea just the ability against

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.600 
effect so yea just the ability against
have<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.930> little<00:02:35.319> bit<00:02:35.560> more<00:02:35.739> subtler

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
have a little bit more subtler

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.449 
have a little bit more subtler
introduction<00:02:37.590> we've<00:02:38.590> also<00:02:38.769> got<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> crush<00:02:39.310> on

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
introduction we've also got the crush on

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.610 
introduction we've also got the crush on
it<00:02:39.579> now<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:39.970> crush<00:02:40.239> on<00:02:40.329> the<00:02:40.450> djm<00:02:40.870> 800<00:02:40.989> sounded

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it now the crush on the djm 800 sounded

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.300 
it now the crush on the djm 800 sounded
very<00:02:41.739> similar<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:44.440> sometimes<00:02:44.680> with<00:02:45.280> a

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
very similar to we sometimes with a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.940 
very similar to we sometimes with a
little<00:02:45.579> bit<00:02:45.700> too<00:02:45.849> harsh<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.590> now<00:02:47.739> with<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
little bit too harsh but now with the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.490 
little bit too harsh but now with the
parameter<00:02:48.250> or<00:02:48.730> maybe<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.420> wet<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.840> dry<00:02:50.049> pop<00:02:50.350> of

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
parameter or maybe the wet to dry pop of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.819 
parameter or maybe the wet to dry pop of
the<00:02:50.590> effects<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.690> can<00:02:52.840> introduce<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.470> kind<00:02:53.739> of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
the effects you can introduce a kind of

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.400 
the effects you can introduce a kind of
low<00:02:54.130> by<00:02:55.200> sound<00:02:56.200> but<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.840> doesn't<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.260> have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
low by sound but it doesn't really have

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.790 
low by sound but it doesn't really have
as<00:02:59.500> much<00:02:59.739> attack

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.120 

rather<00:03:09.800> than<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:14.349> we've<00:03:15.349> also<00:03:15.530> got<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.770> zip<00:03:15.980> on

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
rather than and we've also got a zip on

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.500 
rather than and we've also got a zip on
here<00:03:16.250> which<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.580> more<00:03:16.760> or<00:03:16.849> less<00:03:16.880> like<00:03:17.150> at<00:03:17.300> times

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
here which is more or less like at times

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.930 
here which is more or less like at times
yeah<00:03:18.260> time<00:03:18.530> stretch<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:25.370> again<00:03:25.700> with<00:03:25.880> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
yeah time stretch so but again with the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.120 
yeah time stretch so but again with the
parameter<00:03:26.450> kind<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.290> more<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.739> minimum

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
parameter kind of more of the minimum

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:38.350 
parameter kind of more of the minimum
stage<00:03:36.250> but<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.340> probably<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.670> main<00:03:37.940> one<00:03:38.150> here

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
stage but the probably the main one here

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.140 
stage but the probably the main one here
is<00:03:38.569> out<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.900> noise<00:03:39.080> generator<00:03:39.880> now<00:03:40.880> if<00:03:40.940> we

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
is out of the noise generator now if we

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.380 
is out of the noise generator now if we
introduce<00:03:41.540> noise<00:03:41.840> what<00:03:42.739> happens<00:03:43.100> now<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.610> an

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
introduce noise what happens now is an

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.420 
introduce noise what happens now is an
oscillator<00:03:44.840> signal<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.500> sent<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.860> four

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
oscillator signal is sent to four

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.840 
oscillator signal is sent to four
individual<00:03:47.209> channels<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:49.010> I'm<00:03:49.489> running<00:03:49.670> on

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
individual channels so I'm running on

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.059 
individual channels so I'm running on
channel<00:03:50.209> 2<00:03:50.450> by<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.140> activate<00:03:51.440> noise<00:03:51.799> this

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
channel 2 by you to activate noise this

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.820 
channel 2 by you to activate noise this
is<00:03:52.250> now<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.430> volume<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.239> noise<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:54.709> I

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
is now the volume of the noise and if I

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.830 
is now the volume of the noise and if I
increase<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.610> minimum<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:56.209> maximum<00:03:56.239> plot<00:03:56.750> on

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
increase the minimum to maximum plot on

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.699 
increase the minimum to maximum plot on
the<00:03:56.930> filter<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.959> basically<00:04:00.200> got<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.410> white

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the filter it basically got a white

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:09.310 
the filter it basically got a white
noise<00:04:01.510> filter<00:04:02.510> signal<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:08.989> acts<00:04:09.170> as

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
noise filter signal so this now acts as

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.140 
noise filter signal so this now acts as
the<00:04:09.440> noise<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.010> volume<00:04:10.579> control<00:04:10.880> over<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the noise the volume control over the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.529 
the noise the volume control over the
noise<00:04:15.940> so<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.030> doesn't<00:04:17.299> have<00:04:17.419> to

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
noise so that doesn't have to

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.090 
noise so that doesn't have to
necessarily<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:18.229> on<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.680> channel<00:04:18.979> that

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
necessarily be on the channel that

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.710 
necessarily be on the channel that
you're<00:04:19.220> playing<00:04:19.430> audio<00:04:19.850> through<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.359> could<00:04:20.570> be

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
you're playing audio through it could be

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.960 
you're playing audio through it could be
on<00:04:20.840> another<00:04:21.200> channel<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.010> facebook<00:04:22.789> channel

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
on another channel so facebook channel

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.490 
on another channel so facebook channel
one<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:26.419> you've<00:04:26.570> got<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.720> bit<00:04:26.900> more<00:04:27.080> kind<00:04:27.260> of

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
one up and you've got a bit more kind of

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.110 
one up and you've got a bit more kind of
control<00:04:28.039> there<00:04:28.340> rather<00:04:28.610> than<00:04:28.729> being<00:04:29.030> right

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
control there rather than being right

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.680 
control there rather than being right
over<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:29.630> track<00:04:34.270> that's<00:04:35.270> probably<00:04:35.510> going<00:04:35.630> to

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
over the track that's probably going to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.120 
over the track that's probably going to
be<00:04:35.750> every<00:04:36.020> sound<00:04:36.229> engineers<00:04:36.650> worse<00:04:36.860> than<00:04:37.039> I

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
be every sound engineers worse than I

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.760 
be every sound engineers worse than I
they're<00:04:37.340> basically<00:04:38.169> but<00:04:39.169> what<00:04:39.289> you<00:04:39.410> can<00:04:39.620> begin

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
they're basically but what you can begin

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.250 
they're basically but what you can begin
to<00:04:39.890> do<00:04:40.130> now<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.340> introduce<00:04:40.789> some<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.840> e

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
to do now is introduce some of the e

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.980 
to do now is introduce some of the e
effects<00:04:42.770> effects<00:04:43.220> over<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.940> top<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.360> our<00:04:44.419> nose

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
effects effects over the top of our nose

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.260 
effects effects over the top of our nose
so<00:04:45.740> I'm<00:04:46.100> running<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.370> channel<00:04:46.729> one<00:04:46.880> now<00:04:47.060> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
so I'm running on channel one now and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.320 
so I'm running on channel one now and
maybe<00:04:47.930> if<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.200> use<00:04:48.410> an<00:04:48.530> echo<00:04:48.860> run<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:49.820> over<00:04:49.910> three

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
maybe if I use an echo run it over three

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.050 
maybe if I use an echo run it over three
quarters<00:04:50.570> at<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.990> bar

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.909 

so<00:04:59.060> combining<00:04:59.810> these<00:05:00.050> effects<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.740> these

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
so combining these effects and these

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.530 
so combining these effects and these
effects<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.490> know<00:05:01.520> you've<00:05:01.850> got<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.360> many

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
effects you know you've got so many

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.840 
effects you know you've got so many
different<00:05:02.780> possibilities<00:05:03.259> there<00:05:03.800> what<00:05:04.759> are

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
different possibilities there what are

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.150 
different possibilities there what are
the<00:05:04.910> more<00:05:05.060> fun<00:05:05.360> effects<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:06.560> probably<00:05:06.979> that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
the more fun effects it's probably that

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.460 
the more fun effects it's probably that
I've<00:05:07.310> using<00:05:07.639> the<00:05:07.699> transform<00:05:08.090> over<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> top<00:05:09.289> of

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
I've using the transform over the top of

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.840 
I've using the transform over the top of
the<00:05:09.590> white<00:05:09.740> noise<00:05:10.009> so<00:05:10.340> I've<00:05:10.430> got<00:05:10.580> my<00:05:10.610> white

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
the white noise so I've got my white

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.430 
the white noise so I've got my white
noise<00:05:11.030> on<00:05:11.240> channel<00:05:11.570> 1<00:05:12.430> i'll<00:05:13.430> turn<00:05:13.639> echo<00:05:14.090> are

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
noise on channel 1 i'll turn echo are

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.460 
noise on channel 1 i'll turn echo are
introduced<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.940> transform<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:18.020> if<00:05:18.199> I<00:05:18.289> just

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
introduced a transform and if I just

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.840 
introduced a transform and if I just
activate<00:05:18.979> it<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:20.979> because<00:05:21.979> my<00:05:22.009> visa<00:05:22.400> set<00:05:22.729> up

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
activate it and because my visa set up

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.879 
activate it and because my visa set up
perfectly<00:05:23.060> those<00:05:23.720> two<00:05:24.020> sinking<00:05:24.530> effects

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
perfectly those two sinking effects

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.189 
perfectly those two sinking effects
shouldn't<00:05:25.580> slip<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.150> then<00:05:26.840> you've<00:05:26.960> got<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
shouldn't slip and then you've got the

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.770 
shouldn't slip and then you've got the
ability<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.800> come<00:05:31.090> now<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.150> can<00:05:32.300> change<00:05:32.600> the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
ability to come now you can change the

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:56.140 
ability to come now you can change the
parameter<00:05:54.220> so<00:05:55.220> what<00:05:55.430> you<00:05:55.550> kind<00:05:55.699> of<00:05:55.849> get<00:05:56.000> to

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
parameter so what you kind of get to

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.730 
parameter so what you kind of get to
start<00:05:56.330> using<00:05:56.509> the<00:05:56.720> mixer<00:05:57.110> if<00:05:57.169> you<00:05:57.320> can<00:05:57.530> really

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
start using the mixer if you can really

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.500 
start using the mixer if you can really
start<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.250> be<00:05:58.310> very<00:05:58.550> creative<00:05:58.940> and<00:05:59.330> it's

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
start to be very creative and it's

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.150 
start to be very creative and it's
really<00:05:59.930> up<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.349> user<00:06:00.500> how<00:06:00.650> creative<00:06:01.130> you

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
really up to the user how creative you

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.939 
really up to the user how creative you
want<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.520> be<00:06:02.199> so<00:06:03.199> they're<00:06:03.349> kind<00:06:03.500> of<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.770> main

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
want to be so they're kind of the main

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.040 
want to be so they're kind of the main
principles<00:06:04.520> behind<00:06:04.669> the<00:06:05.000> instant<00:06:05.479> effects<00:06:05.900> on
