00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
here we have the choice between tangle

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.960 
here we have the choice between tangle
SAP<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.650> possibly<00:00:34.040> a<00:00:34.129> refuge<00:00:34.580> and<00:00:34.790> maybe

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
SAP and possibly a refuge and maybe

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.750

going<00:00:35.449> five<00:00:35.720> colors<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.290> think<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.309> five<00:00:37.460> color

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
going five colors I think the five color

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.360 
going five colors I think the five color
option<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.300> little<00:00:38.510> greedy<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.680> we'll<00:00:39.949> we'll

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.040 
option is a little greedy so we'll we'll
just<00:00:40.550> take<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.850> tangle<00:00:41.180> SAP<00:00:41.360> as<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.600> sideboard

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
just take the tangle SAP as a sideboard

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.800 
just take the tangle SAP as a sideboard

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so weird XD morrow Raptors not looking

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.360 
so weird XD morrow Raptors not looking
like<00:01:25.620> it's<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.980> make<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> cut

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.550 

and<00:01:32.610> here's<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.360> interesting<00:01:33.570> pic<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.350> have

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and here's an interesting pic we have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.130 
and here's an interesting pic we have
again<00:01:35.340> hideous<00:01:35.730> end<00:01:35.940> which<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
again hideous end which I don't think is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
again hideous end which I don't think is
good<00:01:37.350> enough<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.620> make<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.800> deck<00:01:38.370> just

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
good enough to make the deck just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
good enough to make the deck just
because<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.180> double<00:01:39.480> black<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:39.990> we

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
because it's double black and we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.490 
because it's double black and we
probably<00:01:40.740> can't<00:01:41.070> reliably<00:01:41.340> cast<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
probably can't reliably cast that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
probably can't reliably cast that
punishing<00:01:43.500> fire<00:01:43.530> although<00:01:44.490> maybe<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.150> as

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
punishing fire although maybe not as

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
punishing fire although maybe not as
good<00:01:45.510> as<00:01:45.600> City<00:01:45.780> send<00:01:46.080> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.650> does<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> same

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
good as City send kind of does the same

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.910 
good as City send kind of does the same
thing<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:49.050> take<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.350> fire<00:01:49.560> though<00:01:49.770> we're

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
thing to take the fire though we're

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
thing to take the fire though we're
passing<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.370> a<00:01:50.540> diabolus<00:01:51.800> like<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.130> be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
passing on a diabolus like I would be

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.310 
passing on a diabolus like I would be
pretty<00:01:53.490> sick<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> our<00:01:53.940> dock<00:01:54.410> but<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.440> think<00:01:55.740> that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
pretty sick in our dock but I think that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.399 
pretty sick in our dock but I think that
creature<00:01:58.320> removals<00:01:58.920> just

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
creature removals just

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.389 
creature removals just

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
so hard to get that we need to take that

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.219 
so hard to get that we need to take that

gazillion<00:02:43.129> creatures<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:43.879> you<00:02:43.970> may<00:02:44.150> be

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
gazillion creatures and then you may be

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.930 
gazillion creatures and then you may be
bushwhack<00:02:44.690> them<00:02:44.720> at<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.140> end<00:02:45.230> there

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060 

and<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.750> mean<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:48.990> Green<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.350> under<00:02:49.560> drafted

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
and I mean if Green is under drafted

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.690 
and I mean if Green is under drafted
might<00:02:50.460> even<00:02:50.640> wheel<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:52.310> although<00:02:53.310> Green

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
might even wheel it although Green

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.110 
might even wheel it although Green
hasn't<00:02:54.060> been<00:02:54.150> over<00:02:54.360> dry<00:02:54.540> under<00:02:54.870> drafted<00:02:55.320> as<00:02:56.120> of

hasn't been over dry under drafted as of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.480 
hasn't been over dry under drafted as of
late

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.400 

yeah<00:03:04.090> we'll<00:03:04.300> go<00:03:04.420> with<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> glade<00:03:04.810> heart<00:03:04.990> just

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
I think it's the safer pick so here

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.070 
I think it's the safer pick so here
we're<00:03:07.930> seeing<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.200> marsh<00:03:08.380> casualties<00:03:10.080> third

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
we're seeing a marsh casualties third

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.800 
we're seeing a marsh casualties third
pick<00:03:11.410> which<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.800> kind<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.160> interesting<00:03:12.810> Oren

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.380 
pack for us the soul stare would be
great<00:04:05.030> if<00:04:05.180> we<00:04:05.209> had<00:04:05.330> more<00:04:05.599> black<00:04:07.239> again<00:04:08.239> we

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
great if we had more black again we

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.910 
great if we had more black again we
really<00:04:08.660> only<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:08.870> two<00:04:09.110> black<00:04:09.349> cards<00:04:09.739> so

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
cut it in this deck will probably not

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.390 
cut it in this deck will probably not
gonna<00:04:16.850> have<00:04:16.970> enough<00:04:17.000> mountains<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:19.160> looks

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
and here we're getting a berserker which

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.570 
and here we're getting a berserker which
is<00:04:29.720> good<00:04:29.930> for<00:04:30.170> us<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.620> hopefully<00:04:31.100> we<00:04:31.400> can

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159

berserker<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.669> think<00:06:00.659> we<00:06:00.749> have<00:06:00.779> more<00:06:01.080> than

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139

enough<00:06:01.319> playable<00:06:01.979> as<00:06:02.099> though<00:06:02.310> so<00:06:02.639> I<00:06:02.669> don't<00:06:02.759> see

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
enough playable as though so I don't see

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.820

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
our allies so might as well just take

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.899 
our allies so might as well just take
the<00:06:07.409> seismic<00:06:07.949> shutter<00:06:08.159> I<00:06:08.370> was<00:06:08.729> another

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
the seismic shutter I was another

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.110 
the seismic shutter I was another
sideboard<00:06:09.569> option<00:06:10.580> we<00:06:11.580> already<00:06:11.669> have<00:06:11.849> a<00:06:11.909> net

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
and land by an rituals garbage so we'll

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.950 
and land by an rituals garbage so we'll
take<00:06:14.849> the<00:06:14.999> crocodiles<00:06:15.479> we<00:06:15.629> don't<00:06:15.779> want<00:06:15.900> to

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
take the crocodiles we don't want to

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.670 
take the crocodiles we don't want to
play<00:06:16.259> against<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:16.770> i<00:06:17.960> will<00:06:18.960> just<00:06:19.080> snag<00:06:19.409> up<00:06:19.560> a

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
play against it i will just snag up a

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.080 
play against it i will just snag up a
forest<00:06:20.629> an<00:06:21.629> island<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:23.029> a<00:06:24.029> collar<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.539> gales

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
forest an island and a collar of gales

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.200 
forest an island and a collar of gales
alright<00:06:27.090> so<00:06:27.300> here<00:06:27.479> we<00:06:27.569> are<00:06:27.719> in<00:06:27.960> deck<00:06:28.620> building

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
alright so here we are in deck building

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.519 
alright so here we are in deck building
we're<00:06:30.210> definitely<00:06:30.330> playing<00:06:30.599> one<00:06:30.870> swamp<00:06:31.199> and

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
we're definitely playing one swamp and

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:39.719 
we're definitely playing one swamp and
all<00:06:32.310> three<00:06:32.580> refuges<00:06:35.479> better<00:06:36.479> of<00:06:36.659> our<00:06:36.810> colors

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.850 

so<00:06:40.300> right<00:06:40.419> now<00:06:40.449> we<00:06:40.569> have<00:06:40.749> 25<00:06:41.169> cards<00:06:41.469> including

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
so right now we have 25 cards including

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.170 
so right now we have 25 cards including
the<00:06:41.919> four<00:06:42.189> lands<00:06:44.039> so<00:06:45.039> that<00:06:45.129> means<00:06:45.279> we're<00:06:45.460> at<00:06:45.550> 21

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
the four lands so that means we're at 21

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.939 
the four lands so that means we're at 21
so<00:06:46.449> we<00:06:46.539> probably<00:06:46.719> want<00:06:46.900> one<00:06:47.110> more<00:06:47.319> playable<00:06:47.740> in

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
so we probably want one more playable in

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.930 
so we probably want one more playable in
here

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.540 

so<00:06:52.510> our<00:06:52.630> choice<00:06:52.870> is<00:06:52.900> probably<00:06:53.550> haggar

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
so our choice is probably haggar

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.740 
so our choice is probably haggar
crocodile<00:06:55.210> or<00:06:55.450> goblin<00:06:56.200> bushwacker<00:06:57.600> make<00:06:58.600> the

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
crocodile or goblin bushwacker make the

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.260 
crocodile or goblin bushwacker make the
bushwhackers<00:06:59.380> a<00:06:59.410> little<00:06:59.710> better<00:07:00.120> we<00:07:01.120> could

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
bushwhackers a little better we could

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.600 
bushwhackers a little better we could
always<00:07:01.390> play<00:07:01.900> colony<00:07:02.650> gem<00:07:02.890> or<00:07:03.100> spider<00:07:03.340> self

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
always play colony gem or spider self

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.060 
always play colony gem or spider self
net<00:07:03.790> as<00:07:03.910> well<00:07:04.470> probably<00:07:05.470> not<00:07:05.560> as<00:07:05.710> good<00:07:05.860> as<00:07:05.950> the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
net as well probably not as good as the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:15.679 
net as well probably not as good as the
bushwacker<00:07:06.490> though

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.009 

so<00:07:16.259> I<00:07:16.289> mean<00:07:16.439> if<00:07:16.529> we<00:07:16.619> put<00:07:16.830> in<00:07:16.919> the<00:07:17.009> crocodile

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:18.019 
so I mean if we put in the crocodile

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:22.459 
so I mean if we put in the crocodile
gives<00:07:19.019> us<00:07:19.229> three<00:07:20.009> four<00:07:20.279> drops<00:07:20.610> but<00:07:21.029> I<00:07:21.360> don't<00:07:22.319> I

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:22.469 
gives us three four drops but I don't I

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:23.889 
gives us three four drops but I don't I
just<00:07:22.559> don't<00:07:22.799> think<00:07:22.979> he's<00:07:23.099> that<00:07:23.249> good<00:07:23.489> I<00:07:23.519> think

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:23.899 
just don't think he's that good I think

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.119 
just don't think he's that good I think
we<00:07:24.899> want<00:07:25.110> to<00:07:25.169> be<00:07:25.229> as<00:07:25.319> aggressive<00:07:25.499> as<00:07:25.769> we<00:07:25.919> can

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.129 
we want to be as aggressive as we can

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:27.499 
we want to be as aggressive as we can
and<00:07:26.249> bushwacker<00:07:26.639> just<00:07:26.939> does<00:07:27.089> that<00:07:27.269> a<00:07:27.299> little

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:27.509 
and bushwacker just does that a little

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.450 
and bushwacker just does that a little
better

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.840 

so<00:07:31.060> suggest<00:07:31.870> to<00:07:32.229> swamp<00:07:32.530> for<00:07:33.009> mountains<00:07:33.340> eight

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
so suggest to swamp for mountains eight

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.270 
so suggest to swamp for mountains eight
forests

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.710 

I<00:07:39.400> think<00:07:39.820> we<00:07:39.940> might<00:07:40.090> actually<00:07:40.270> be<00:07:40.480> able<00:07:40.570> to

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
I think we might actually be able to

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.960 
I think we might actually be able to
take<00:07:40.930> the<00:07:41.050> swamps<00:07:41.440> down<00:07:41.620> to<00:07:41.860> zero<00:07:42.220> just<00:07:42.760> play

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970 
take the swamps down to zero just play

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.830 
take the swamps down to zero just play
the<00:07:43.120> one

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:59.519 

pump<00:07:50.470> up<00:07:50.560> our<00:07:50.770> mountains<00:07:51.100> a<00:07:51.190> bit

00:07:59.519 --> 00:07:59.529 

00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:01.889 

let's<00:08:00.129> throw<00:08:00.369> an<00:08:00.459> extra<00:08:00.599> forest<00:08:01.599> in<00:08:01.779> there

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:01.899 
let's throw an extra forest in there

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:07.480 
let's throw an extra forest in there
baby

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.490 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.120 

yeah<00:08:08.120> they<00:08:08.360> could<00:08:08.539> we<00:08:08.660> will<00:08:08.870> just<00:08:09.770> cuz<00:08:09.949> we<00:08:10.039> have
