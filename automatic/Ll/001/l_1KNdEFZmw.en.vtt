that man this one right this is the
first<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> bred<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.050> with

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
first one I bred right or is this with

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.160 
first one I bred right or is this with
me<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> screen<00:00:40.710> yeah<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.170> what

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
me on the screen yeah I see you see what

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
me on the screen yeah I see you see what
when<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> standing<00:00:44.190> potential<00:00:44.730> overall

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
when I was a standing potential overall

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.160 
when I was a standing potential overall
that's<00:00:45.270> how<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> judge<00:00:45.600> did<00:00:45.870> anyway

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that's how I judge did anyway

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.569 
that's how I judge did anyway
incidentally<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:47.100> say<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> its

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
incidentally I would say that its

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.260 
incidentally I would say that its
greatest<00:00:47.789> potential<00:00:48.149> lies<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.570> his<00:00:48.660> HP<00:00:49.100> attack

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
greatest potential lies in his HP attack

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.189 
greatest potential lies in his HP attack
defense<00:00:51.379> special<00:00:52.379> defense<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.010> speed<00:00:54.199> first

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
defense special defense and speed first
