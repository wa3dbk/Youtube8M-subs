00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 the cancellation of the second step which 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 aggregates this stage that enrage this stage 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 three kilometers from the expected arrival on 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.960
 oran security services and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.270
 the organization was totally exceeded 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.990
 leaving the route of the lathe open to the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 traffic 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.609
 something that resulted in a mess at 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 within the pack mingling with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.029
 motorists a fact that would not have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.920
 had to be me I made the decision 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.200
 cancel the stage sportingly and 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.030
 we will start again on the bases 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.040
 of the state can say today the stage 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.720
 is canceled we do not move to everything remained 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.520
 everything is frozen on the carpet yesterday we 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.230
 back on the rankings brière 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.360
 today and yet it was good 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.000
 gone for a nice step linking oran 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.510
 at mostaganem and vultures on oran for 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.120
 the arrival on a distance of 170 km which 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.160
 is characterized by a flat course a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.989
 opportunity for the fastest to boot 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.920
 attacks often aborted by the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.659
 platoon that remain grouped a step 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 canceled but in the standings 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.110
 the Algerian said the same barbarity of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.979
 the Slovak team remains the leader 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.479
 general and we find we love this 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.940
 devil of the roja live from 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.979
 d'oran then the second stage comes 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020
 to be canceled is a big one 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.240
 disappointment just to see it's a case 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.460
 rather rare there was no 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.049
 winner born at least in the peloton of 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.470
 head there were five riders including one 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.960
 Algerian but let's talk with your rösti of 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.270
 the third step that will take place tomorrow 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.270
 what is the program rochdi good evening 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.539
 good evening network the good nights to our 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 dear viewers and I you 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.579
 welcome and if so before 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.609
 yes ol as you said the 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.409
 second step was canceled because of 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.960
 poor traffic management 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.749
 and tomorrow we will have a third stage 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.969
 is a very good step hoping that 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:03.649
 who will regularize the circulation they 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.530
 will close the roads so that 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.360
 cyclists can pass and do their 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.340
 their course normally so tomorrow this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.160
 will be beautiful abbess so there will be a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.890
 transhipment tomorrow morning high ranking 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.080
 towards beautiful abbess and the departure will be given 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.920
 of beautiful abbots to oran the arrival on 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.260
 Oran so it will be a route of 148 km 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.790
 with two sprints logically it's a 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.760
 course in the set which is a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.450
 flat course so it'll be it's going to be 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.740
 easy and at the same time difficult 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.500
 easy for them for sprinters 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.540
 easy for people who attack the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.190
 platoon is a little bit difficult for 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.170
 the climbers because it's going to go very 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.190
