00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the other stores throw away because of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520 
the other stores throw away because of
expiration<00:00:33.570> date<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.290> someone

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
expiration date so because someone

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650 
expiration date so because someone
breaks<00:00:34.739> into<00:00:34.980> them<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.489> whatever<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
thought I'd just go ahead and go through

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.610 
thought I'd just go ahead and go through
some<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> pictures<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> stuff<00:00:40.440> we

some of the pictures of the stuff we

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
some of the pictures of the stuff we
found<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.239> actually<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> big<00:00:42.570> part<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> me

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
found and actually it's a big part of me

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740 
found and actually it's a big part of me
gaining<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> weight<00:00:44.010> back<00:00:44.750> it's

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
gaining a lot of weight back it's

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
gaining a lot of weight back it's
because<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.110> found<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.649> damn<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.160> stuff

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

they're just it's just it's frustrating

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.920 
they're just it's just it's frustrating

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
because you know you don't want to go to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720

waste<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> mentality<00:00:53.160> where<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
waste and I have that mentality where I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
waste and I have that mentality where I
don't<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> waste

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
don't want this to go to waste

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.880 
don't want this to go to waste
and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> eat<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> before<00:00:57.469> it<00:00:58.469> really

and I have to eat it before it really
goes<00:00:59.039> bad<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.840> know<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.469> of

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
goes bad and then you know it's kind of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.800
