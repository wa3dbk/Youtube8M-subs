00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the design there's been loads of people

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
the design there's been loads of people
saying<00:01:18.270> Sony<00:01:18.780> should<00:01:18.960> change<00:01:19.229> things<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

go<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> different<00:01:20.790> approach<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> think

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
go for a different approach but I think

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
go for a different approach but I think
personally<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.380> Omni<00:01:22.979> balanced<00:01:23.310> design

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
personally that Omni balanced design

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
personally that Omni balanced design
looks<00:01:23.820> incredible<00:01:24.390> we've<00:01:24.570> seen<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
Xperia Z through to the z3 plus and I'd

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
Xperia Z through to the z3 plus and I'd
rather<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.920> thinner<00:01:29.310> bezels<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> possibly<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
design now there was also a tip that's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
design now there was also a tip that's
on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> home<00:01:44.430> button<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> side<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> the

on the home button at the side of the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
on the home button at the side of the
device<00:01:45.810> they're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> include<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
device they're going to include a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.399 
device they're going to include a
fingerprint<00:01:47.729> scanner<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.049> ask<00:01:49.229> me

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
fingerprint scanner now if you ask me

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.380 
fingerprint scanner now if you ask me
personally<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.310> huge<00:01:50.670> move<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.970> Sony

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
personally that's a huge move for Sony

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
personally that's a huge move for Sony
it's<00:01:51.780> definitely<00:01:52.409> nothing<00:01:52.799> we've<00:01:53.100> seen<00:01:53.130> like

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it's definitely nothing we've seen like

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.030 
it's definitely nothing we've seen like
before<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> previous

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
before on some of the previous

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.790 
before on some of the previous
experiences<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.729> could<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.060> potential

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
experiences and this could be potential

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.570 
experiences and this could be potential
huge<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.850> upcoming<00:01:59.270> xperia<00:01:59.960> loner<00:02:00.230> and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
huge for the upcoming xperia loner and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.920 
huge for the upcoming xperia loner and
majority<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.820> time<00:02:02.000> people<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:02.630> pick<00:02:02.810> up

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
majority of the time people do pick up

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.170 
majority of the time people do pick up
their<00:02:03.080> smartphone<00:02:03.560> either<00:02:03.860> like<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
their smartphone either like this so

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.790 
their smartphone either like this so
with<00:02:05.450> their<00:02:05.630> thumb<00:02:05.990> in<00:02:06.140> contact<00:02:06.530> with<00:02:06.680> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
with their thumb in contact with the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.280 
with their thumb in contact with the
power<00:02:07.010> button<00:02:07.250> or<00:02:07.670> with<00:02:08.360> their<00:02:08.540> left<00:02:08.750> hand<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
power button or with their left hand and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.080 
power button or with their left hand and
have<00:02:09.680> their<00:02:10.010> index<00:02:10.490> finger<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:10.910> middle

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
have their index finger and middle

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.970 
have their index finger and middle
finger<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.870> contact<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> power<00:02:12.710> button

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
finger in contact with the power button

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.520 
finger in contact with the power button
so<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.820> they<00:02:13.970> could<00:02:14.180> somehow<00:02:14.450> program<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.350> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so if they could somehow program it that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.770 
so if they could somehow program it that
it<00:02:15.650> recognizes<00:02:15.950> your<00:02:16.490> thumb<00:02:16.850> middle<00:02:17.450> finger

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it recognizes your thumb middle finger

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.390 
it recognizes your thumb middle finger
and<00:02:17.810> index<00:02:18.020> finger<00:02:18.560> which<00:02:18.770> has<00:02:18.980> been<00:02:19.190> done

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
and index finger which has been done

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.850 
and index finger which has been done
before<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:20.180> think<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.960> would<00:02:21.110> make<00:02:21.320> unlocking

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
before I think it would make unlocking

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.980 
before I think it would make unlocking
the<00:02:21.980> phone<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.910> know<00:02:23.030> other<00:02:23.210> processes

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
the phone and you know other processes

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.290 
the phone and you know other processes
so<00:02:24.320> much<00:02:24.530> easier<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.340> imagine<00:02:25.700> picking<00:02:26.120> up

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
so much easier like imagine picking up

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.960 
so much easier like imagine picking up
your<00:02:26.480> phone<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:26.930> either<00:02:27.110> hand<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.760> by

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
your phone with either hand and just by

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
your phone with either hand and just by
placing<00:02:29.270> your<00:02:29.480> thumb<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.110> power<00:02:30.320> button

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
placing your thumb on the power button

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.250 
placing your thumb on the power button
which<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.280> had<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.700> do<00:02:31.850> anyway<00:02:32.360> with<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:32.990> lot

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
which you had to do anyway with a lot

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.080 
which you had to do anyway with a lot
the<00:02:33.410> phone<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.310> also<00:02:34.460> nothing<00:02:34.910> like

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the phone and it's also nothing like

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.210 
the phone and it's also nothing like
what<00:02:35.330> we've<00:02:35.480> seen<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.080> Samsung<00:02:36.680> or<00:02:36.920> even

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
what we've seen on the Samsung or even

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.760 
what we've seen on the Samsung or even
Apple<00:02:37.610> devices<00:02:37.970> where<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.960> home<00:02:39.260> button<00:02:39.560> is

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
Apple devices where the home button is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.260 
Apple devices where the home button is
where<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> fingerprint<00:02:40.520> scanner<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.210> you

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
where the fingerprint scanner is so you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.090 
where the fingerprint scanner is so you
may<00:02:41.570> pick<00:02:41.780> up<00:02:41.930> your<00:02:42.170> phone<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.770> still

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
may pick up your phone but you still

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.370 
may pick up your phone but you still
need<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.310> use<00:02:43.580> your<00:02:43.760> other<00:02:43.970> hand<00:02:44.300> or<00:02:44.810> stretch

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
need to use your other hand or stretch

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.770 
need to use your other hand or stretch
down<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.920> thumb<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.880> unlock<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.330> phone<00:02:47.540> so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
down your thumb to unlock the phone so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.690 
down your thumb to unlock the phone so
that<00:02:47.810> would<00:02:48.200> definitely<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.860> big<00:02:49.280> move<00:02:49.490> by

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
that would definitely be a big move by

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
that would definitely be a big move by
Sony<00:02:50.000> if<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.780> include<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.380> I'd<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.680> really

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
Sony if they include that I'd be really

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.830 
Sony if they include that I'd be really
looking<00:02:52.340> forward<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.670> testing<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.630> comes

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
looking forward to testing out it comes

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.720 
looking forward to testing out it comes

tip that Sony might be working with a 4k
display<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.330> Xperia<00:03:17.930> z5<00:03:18.560> only<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> Zed<00:03:19.550> 5

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
display in the Xperia z5 only the Zed 5

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.729 
display in the Xperia z5 only the Zed 5
however<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.480> wasn't<00:03:20.930> mentioned<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.590> they

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
however it wasn't mentioned that they

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.410 
however it wasn't mentioned that they
will<00:03:21.950> be<00:03:22.100> working<00:03:22.459> with<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.730> same<00:03:23.000> 4k

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
will be working with that same 4k

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.140 
will be working with that same 4k
display<00:03:23.840> on<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.140> z5<00:03:24.709> compact<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.940> other

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
display on the z5 compact and the other

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.260 
display on the z5 compact and the other
mid-range<00:03:26.870> z5<00:03:27.860> which<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.550> expected<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.150> be

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
mid-range z5 which is expected to be

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.060 
mid-range z5 which is expected to be
released<00:03:29.300> now<00:03:30.110> hearing<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.709> there's<00:03:30.980> going

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
released now hearing that there's going

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.979 
released now hearing that there's going
to<00:03:31.160> be<00:03:31.190> 4k<00:03:31.550> on<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.850> smartphone<00:03:32.150> brings<00:03:32.570> up<00:03:32.720> so

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
to be 4k on a smartphone brings up so

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.479 
to be 4k on a smartphone brings up so
many<00:03:33.050> other<00:03:33.350> factors<00:03:33.620> you've<00:03:34.280> got<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
many other factors you've got to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.520 
many other factors you've got to
consider<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.940> battery<00:03:35.390> life<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.600> processor

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
consider the battery life the processor

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.770 
consider the battery life the processor
overheating<00:03:37.489> but<00:03:38.090> one<00:03:38.360> thing<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.630> really

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
overheating but one thing that really

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.449 
overheating but one thing that really
does<00:03:39.140> matter<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.530> most<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.920> battery<00:03:40.430> life

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
does matter the most is the battery life

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.300 
does matter the most is the battery life
and<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:40.940> I've<00:03:41.120> said<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.450> previous<00:03:41.720> videos

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and like I've said in previous videos

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.040 
and like I've said in previous videos
these<00:03:43.310> new<00:03:43.520> processes<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.330> Snapdragon<00:03:44.930> are

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
these new processes that Snapdragon are

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.320 
these new processes that Snapdragon are
producing<00:03:45.380> can<00:03:45.650> handle<00:03:45.980> 4k<00:03:46.220> very<00:03:46.580> well<00:03:46.850> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
producing can handle 4k very well the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.110 
producing can handle 4k very well the
Snapdragon<00:03:47.930> 810<00:03:48.230> processor<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.160> also<00:03:49.970> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
Snapdragon 810 processor and also the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.300 
Snapdragon 810 processor and also the
820<00:03:50.690> processor<00:03:50.720> which<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.620> still<00:03:52.100> in<00:03:52.220> the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
820 processor which is still in the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.030 
820 processor which is still in the
works<00:03:52.430> i<00:03:52.610> believe<00:03:52.910> they<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.660> handle<00:03:53.870> 4k<00:03:54.320> just

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
works i believe they can handle 4k just

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.440 
works i believe they can handle 4k just
fine<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:55.640> you've<00:03:55.790> got<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.000> consider<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
fine but you've got to consider the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.009 
fine but you've got to consider the
battery<00:03:56.930> life<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.110> most<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:58.100> 4k<00:03:58.730> is

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
battery life the most because 4k is

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.290 
battery life the most because 4k is
extremely<00:04:00.019> power<00:04:00.890> consumption<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:01.760> will<00:04:02.000> take

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
extremely power consumption it will take

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.600 
extremely power consumption it will take
back<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.720> life<00:04:02.900> very<00:04:03.260> quickly<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.950> Sony

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
back to life very quickly and Sony

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.070 
back to life very quickly and Sony
actually<00:04:04.910> pushed<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.239> statement<00:04:05.660> out<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.930> one

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
actually pushed a statement out in one

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.600 
actually pushed a statement out in one
of<00:04:06.110> their<00:04:06.320> articles<00:04:06.830> saying<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.220> they<00:04:07.340> won't

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
of their articles saying that they won't

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.090 
of their articles saying that they won't
compromise

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
compromise

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.730 
compromise
power<00:04:09.310> consumption<00:04:09.820> for<00:04:10.150> pixels<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:11.170> that

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
power consumption for pixels so that

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.740

does make the whole 4k dream in the

does make the whole 4k dream in the
Xperia<00:04:14.230> z5<00:04:14.710> seem<00:04:15.130> less<00:04:15.670> believable<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.870> it

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
Xperia z5 seem less believable but it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.830 
Xperia z5 seem less believable but it
also<00:04:17.230> makes<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.739> quad<00:04:18.040> HD<00:04:18.400> display<00:04:18.840> dream

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
also makes the quad HD display dream

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.600 
also makes the quad HD display dream
sound<00:04:20.200> less<00:04:20.410> believable<00:04:20.650> as<00:04:21.010> well<00:04:21.190> they<00:04:21.459> may

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
sound less believable as well they may

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.460 
sound less believable as well they may
just<00:04:21.640> stick<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.180> their<00:04:22.360> 1080p<00:04:23.050> display

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
just stick with their 1080p display

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.160 
just stick with their 1080p display
seeing<00:04:24.010> as<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.370> does<00:04:24.970> get<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.210> job<00:04:25.330> done<00:04:25.570> it

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
seeing as that does get the job done it

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.510 
seeing as that does get the job done it
takes<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.740> less<00:04:26.890> back<00:04:27.130> through<00:04:27.340> life

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
takes up less back through life

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.610 
takes up less back through life
interestingly<00:04:28.090> however<00:04:28.570> as<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.170> was<00:04:29.350> looking

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
interestingly however as I was looking

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.590 
interestingly however as I was looking
through<00:04:29.650> some<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.190> Sony<00:04:30.460> forums<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.180> found

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
through some of the Sony forums I found

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.330 
through some of the Sony forums I found
this<00:04:31.870> display<00:04:32.350> power<00:04:32.680> consumption

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
this display power consumption

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.310 
this display power consumption
comparison<00:04:34.090> which<00:04:34.480> actually<00:04:34.660> compared<00:04:35.230> a

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
comparison which actually compared a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.680 
comparison which actually compared a
quad<00:04:35.620> HD<00:04:35.980> display<00:04:36.010> power<00:04:36.760> consumption<00:04:37.420> to<00:04:37.660> a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
quad HD display power consumption to a

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.200 
quad HD display power consumption to a
4k<00:04:38.410> display<00:04:38.740> power<00:04:38.980> consumption<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.820> as<00:04:40.060> you

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
4k display power consumption and as you

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.430 
4k display power consumption and as you
guys<00:04:40.270> can<00:04:40.570> see<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.380> quad<00:04:41.650> HD<00:04:41.920> display<00:04:41.950> takes

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
guys can see the quad HD display takes

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.710 
guys can see the quad HD display takes
2322<00:04:44.440> megawatts<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:46.060> know<00:04:46.150> compared<00:04:46.570> to

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
2322 megawatts and you know compared to

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.460 
2322 megawatts and you know compared to
the<00:04:46.840> 4k<00:04:47.260> display<00:04:47.680> which<00:04:47.920> actually<00:04:48.160> takes<00:04:49.470> 2452

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
the 4k display which actually takes 2452

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.050 
the 4k display which actually takes 2452
you<00:04:51.040> can<00:04:51.160> definitely<00:04:51.370> see<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
you can definitely see that the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.910 
you can definitely see that the
difference<00:04:52.420> isn't<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:53.020> huge<00:04:53.320> is<00:04:53.530> definitely

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
difference isn't that huge is definitely

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.010 
difference isn't that huge is definitely
something<00:04:54.160> Sony<00:04:54.610> might<00:04:55.000> be<00:04:55.180> able<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.600> work<00:04:55.750> on

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
something Sony might be able to work on

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.170 
something Sony might be able to work on
however<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.800> future<00:04:57.220> unfortunately

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
however in the future unfortunately

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.460 
however in the future unfortunately
there<00:04:58.360> hasn't<00:04:58.540> actually<00:04:58.750> been<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:59.290> much

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
there hasn't actually been that much

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.110 
there hasn't actually been that much
information<00:05:00.100> released<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.580> terms<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:01.000> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
information released in terms of the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.760 
information released in terms of the
processor<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:01.930> camera<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.500> we're<00:05:02.590> going<00:05:02.710> to
