event the fuel tank pull the choke and
the<00:01:15.600> current<00:01:15.930> temperature<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:18.560> looks

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the current temperature in here is looks

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
the current temperature in here is looks
like<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.830> 32<00:01:20.250> degrees<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.570> now

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like it's 32 degrees in here right now

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.940 
like it's 32 degrees in here right now
so<00:01:22.290> keep<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.070> mind<00:01:24.710> got<00:01:25.710> tremendous

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
compression oops I guess I got to put it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:58.850 
compression oops I guess I got to put it
on<00:01:30.720> start

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460 

May<00:01:59.860> has<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.280> 12<00:02:00.580> volt<00:02:00.990> generator<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.200> -

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
May has the 12 volt generator on it -

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:28.210 
May has the 12 volt generator on it -
which<00:02:02.620> is<00:02:02.770> kind<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.040> cool<00:02:22.110> almost

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.410 

so<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:30.780> make<00:02:30.930> engines<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> start<00:02:31.770> good<00:02:32.420> and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
so we make engines that start good and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.060 
so we make engines that start good and
there<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> folks

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
there you have it folks
