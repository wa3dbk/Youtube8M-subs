00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and shot power his long shots are not

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
and shot power his long shots are not
the<00:02:47.129> best<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.209> really<00:02:48.480> needed

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the best but that's not really needed

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.190 
the best but that's not really needed
for<00:02:49.469> a<00:02:49.500> striker<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.310> he<00:02:50.549> has<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.810> good

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
for a striker and he has a really good

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.970

agility<00:02:52.799> sprint<00:02:53.609> speed<00:02:53.849> acceleration<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.680> he

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
agility sprint speed acceleration so he

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.910 
agility sprint speed acceleration so he
is<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.370> an<00:02:56.519> absolute<00:02:56.670> beast<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.620> hopefully

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
