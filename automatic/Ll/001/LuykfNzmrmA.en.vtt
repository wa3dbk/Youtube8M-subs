00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
worth buying or not and you will get my

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
worth buying or not and you will get my
opinion<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.670> even<00:01:05.850> opened<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.450> yet

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
opinion I have not even opened this yet

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
opinion I have not even opened this yet
so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.610> have<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.970> idea<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> expect<00:01:10.909> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so I have no idea what to expect the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
so I have no idea what to expect the
trailer<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.869> worried<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> could

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
trailer has me worried that this could

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.880 
trailer has me worried that this could
be<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.270> release<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.840> gets<00:01:16.020> left<00:01:16.350> by<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
be a release that just gets left by the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.230 
be a release that just gets left by the
wayside<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:19.759> there's<00:01:20.759> hope<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:23.240> guess

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
wayside but there's hope still I guess

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.870 
wayside but there's hope still I guess
the<00:01:24.659> only<00:01:25.049> thing<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.850> open<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.720> up

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
the only thing to do is to open this up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.569 
the only thing to do is to open this up
this<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.259> video<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.619> probably<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.460> be

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this first video will probably just be

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.630 
this first video will probably just be
the<00:01:32.790> unboxing<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:34.040> I'm<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the unboxing I don't think I'm going to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.429 
the unboxing I don't think I'm going to
get<00:01:36.210> into<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> review<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:39.170> look<00:01:40.170> for

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
get into the review at all but look for

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.480 
get into the review at all but look for
my<00:01:40.560> other<00:01:40.740> videos<00:01:41.250> coming<00:01:41.869> later<00:01:43.490> probably

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.060

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
this blu-ray case is really weird the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.140 
this blu-ray case is really weird the
way<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.320> if<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.950> look<00:04:40.190> like<00:04:40.670> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
way that it is if you look like the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.270 
way that it is if you look like the
opening<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:41.900> blu-ray<00:04:42.320> case<00:04:42.530> is<00:04:42.860> really

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
opening on this blu-ray case is really

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.960 
opening on this blu-ray case is really
really<00:04:43.880> small

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
really small

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.650 
really small
normal<00:04:46.970> blu-ray<00:04:47.270> case<00:04:47.510> isn't<00:04:47.750> like<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:52.660> well

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
normal blu-ray case isn't like this well

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:03.310 
normal blu-ray case isn't like this well
I<00:04:53.690> thought<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.410> had<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.770> opened<00:05:01.930> try<00:05:02.930> not<00:05:03.140> to

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
I thought I had it opened try not to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:23.950 
I thought I had it opened try not to
scratch<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:03.800> at<00:05:04.370> all<00:05:22.330> my<00:05:23.330> dog<00:05:23.540> over<00:05:23.810> there

case just in case you're not a normal

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.590 
case just in case you're not a normal
person<00:05:43.610> that<00:05:43.850> buys<00:05:44.060> blu-rays<00:05:46.360> this<00:05:47.360> is<00:05:47.510> how

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
person that buys blu-rays this is how

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.240

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
blu-rays normally look see how much

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.420 
blu-rays normally look see how much
bigger<00:05:49.580> this<00:05:50.270> isn't<00:05:50.660> that<00:05:50.810> kind<00:05:51.290> of<00:05:51.350> kind<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
bigger this isn't that kind of kind of a

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.410 
bigger this isn't that kind of kind of a
unique<00:05:52.970> case<00:05:53.510> design<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:53.960> guess<00:05:54.760> yeah<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:56.330> you

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
unique case design I guess yeah and you

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.510 
unique case design I guess yeah and you
could<00:05:56.600> tell<00:05:56.750> it's<00:05:56.930> it's<00:05:57.200> a<00:05:57.320> thicker<00:05:57.560> we<00:05:58.370> were<00:05:58.490> a

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
could tell it's it's a thicker we were a

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.460 
could tell it's it's a thicker we were a
case<00:05:58.760> from<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.270> other<00:05:59.420> ones

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:17.130 

yeah<00:06:08.110> okay<00:06:09.110> let's<00:06:09.260> open<00:06:09.380> this<00:06:09.650> up

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:25.150 

okay<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:20.080> you've<00:06:21.080> got<00:06:21.350> that<00:06:21.530> oh<00:06:21.710> no<00:06:24.010> what<00:06:25.010> is

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
okay so you've got that oh no what is

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.300 
okay so you've got that oh no what is
this<00:06:25.490> -<00:06:25.820> I<00:06:29.590> hope<00:06:30.590> this<00:06:30.770> isn't<00:06:30.980> anything

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
this - I hope this isn't anything

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.630 
this - I hope this isn't anything
significant<00:06:32.770> that's<00:06:33.770> never<00:06:34.040> cool<00:06:34.370> when<00:06:34.550> you

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
significant that's never cool when you

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.310 
significant that's never cool when you
open<00:06:34.910> it<00:06:35.000> up<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:35.300> something's<00:06:35.960> broken

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
open it up and something's broken

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.770 
open it up and something's broken
somewhere<00:06:37.030> hopefully<00:06:38.030> it's<00:06:38.360> not<00:06:38.540> one<00:06:38.750> of

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
somewhere hopefully it's not one of

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.180 
somewhere hopefully it's not one of
these<00:06:38.930> clips<00:06:41.050> now<00:06:42.050> I<00:06:42.290> can't<00:06:42.620> figure<00:06:42.800> out<00:06:43.010> what

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
these clips now I can't figure out what

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.370 
these clips now I can't figure out what
it<00:06:43.310> is<00:06:43.460> there's<00:06:44.420> not<00:06:44.630> a<00:06:44.660> piece<00:06:44.840> of<00:06:44.900> broken

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
it is there's not a piece of broken

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:54.490 
it is there's not a piece of broken
something<00:06:51.820> okay<00:06:52.820> so<00:06:52.880> just<00:06:53.480> based<00:06:54.110> off<00:06:54.290> of<00:06:54.350> that

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
something okay so just based off of that

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.830 
something okay so just based off of that
