00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
think I'm more significant reason which

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.680 
think I'm more significant reason which
is<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:47.949> if<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.400> look<00:00:48.430> at<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.940> leader<00:00:49.210> of

this<00:00:50.080> poem<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:51.040> was<00:00:51.309> written<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:52.059> this<00:00:52.809> was

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
this poem that was written and this was

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.500 
this poem that was written and this was
I<00:00:53.470> guess<00:00:54.190> back<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:55.379> 1987<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:57.340> lyrics<00:00:58.239> are

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
I guess back in 1987 the lyrics are

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.780 
I guess back in 1987 the lyrics are
pretty<00:00:58.690> pretty<00:00:59.170> accurately<00:00:59.769> describe<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
pretty pretty accurately describe the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.860 
pretty pretty accurately describe the
person<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.449> was<00:01:01.750> back<00:01:02.379> then<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.949> then

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
person that I was back then and then

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.800 
person that I was back then and then
description<00:01:04.870> has<00:01:05.049> become<00:01:05.520> really<00:01:06.520> just<00:01:06.810> let

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
description has become really just let

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.940 
description has become really just let
go<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.479> guess<00:01:10.630> where<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.170> song<00:01:11.440> was<00:01:11.680> once

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
go so I guess where this song was once

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.660 
go so I guess where this song was once
maybe

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
maybe

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.109 
maybe
contemplation<00:01:14.950> 1<00:01:16.270> alienation<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:18.229> now<00:01:18.650> become

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
contemplation 1 alienation is now become

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.929 
contemplation 1 alienation is now become
kind<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.270> meditation<00:01:20.780> on<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.939> importance

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
kind of a meditation on the importance

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:55.110 
kind of a meditation on the importance
in<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:23.240> power<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:24.220> change
