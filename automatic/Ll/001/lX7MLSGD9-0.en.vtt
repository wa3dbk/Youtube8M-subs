00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this is washed gravel I'm going to make

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
this is washed gravel I'm going to make
sure<00:00:49.680> there's<00:00:49.950> absolutely<00:00:50.610> no<00:00:50.969> dirt<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.730> so

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
now we have the start of the BIOS and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
now we have the start of the BIOS and
filter<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:56.640> I'm<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.000> ahead<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> put

filter now I'm going to go ahead and put

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.470 
filter now I'm going to go ahead and put
some<00:00:57.449> sand<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:59.039> that<00:01:02.270> we're<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
some sand on top of that we're going to

so<00:01:20.050> it's<00:01:20.170> time<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.470> test<00:01:20.680> out<00:01:20.920> our<00:01:20.950> BIOS<00:01:21.430> and

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
so it's time to test out our BIOS and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
so it's time to test out our BIOS and
filter<00:01:22.180> here

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:44.210 

let's<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.219> this<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.640> easy<00:01:32.670> way

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.680 

Wow<00:01:45.220> thought<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.000> was<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.300> be<00:01:46.420> an<00:01:46.480> easy

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
Wow thought it was going to be an easy

00:01:46.690 --> 00:02:01.440 
Wow thought it was going to be an easy
way<00:01:59.280> it's<00:02:00.280> running<00:02:00.580> down<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.790> little<00:02:01.090> stick

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
way it's running down a little stick

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.820 
way it's running down a little stick
that<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.690> put<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.110> there<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.470> dripping<00:02:02.710> off

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
that I put in there and dripping off

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.430 
that I put in there and dripping off
into<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.250> glass<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.870> could<00:02:05.050> either<00:02:05.140> use<00:02:05.260> a

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
into the glass you could either use a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.530 
into the glass you could either use a
straw<00:02:05.860> or<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.820> like<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> little<00:02:07.150> stick<00:02:07.510> that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
straw or just like a little stick that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
straw or just like a little stick that

the water runs down here's the dirty
water<00:02:09.820> I'm<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.240> put<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.660> bios<00:02:10.929> and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
water I'm going to put in the bios and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.820 
water I'm going to put in the bios and
filter<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.790> cloudy<00:02:13.209> dirty<00:02:13.720> let's<00:02:14.410> put<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.740> in

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
filter it's cloudy dirty let's put it in

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.070 
filter it's cloudy dirty let's put it in
the<00:02:14.920> bios<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.400> filter<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:17.020> how<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> goes

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the bios and filter see how it goes

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.150 
the bios and filter see how it goes
going<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> filter<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.620> over<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.690> house<00:02:22.690> here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.230 

it's<00:02:27.160> starting<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> come<00:02:27.760> out<00:02:27.880> down<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
it's starting to come out down the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's starting to come out down the
bottom<00:02:31.410> yeah<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.590> water<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.190> cleaner

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
bottom yeah that water is way cleaner

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.550 
bottom yeah that water is way cleaner
I'm<00:02:34.330> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.540> go<00:02:34.600> ahead<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.870> swap<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.350> out

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
I'm going to go ahead and swap this out

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.530 
I'm going to go ahead and swap this out
with<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.040> glass<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.060> we'll<00:02:37.180> pull<00:02:37.420> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
with this glass here so we'll pull this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.530 
with this glass here so we'll pull this
out<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:39.030> taking<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> little<00:02:40.209> longer<00:02:40.420> than

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
out of here taking a little longer than

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.520 
out of here taking a little longer than
I<00:02:40.720> thought

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.190 

all<00:02:44.530> right<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:46.570> what<00:02:47.050> do<00:02:47.140> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
all right so I don't know what do you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.090 
all right so I don't know what do you
think<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.690> might<00:02:49.959> not<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.170> perfect<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:50.860> it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
think that might not be perfect but it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.580 
think that might not be perfect but it
sure<00:02:51.370> damn<00:02:51.640> close<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.959> looks<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.290> lot<00:02:53.440> cleaner

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
sure damn close that looks a lot cleaner

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.750 
sure damn close that looks a lot cleaner
to<00:02:53.890> me<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:58.150> bios<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.870> filter<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.760> lot

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to me that is the bios and filter a lot

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
to me that is the bios and filter a lot
more<00:03:00.970> sanded<00:03:01.480> up

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.510 

and<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> clean<00:03:09.150> water

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.670 

it<00:03:15.060> mostly<00:03:15.570> just<00:03:15.750> gets<00:03:15.960> rid<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.320> turbidity

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it mostly just gets rid of the turbidity

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.220 
it mostly just gets rid of the turbidity
so<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:18.090> means<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> water<00:03:19.020> doesn't

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
so that means that the water doesn't

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.010 
so that means that the water doesn't
look<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.530> cloudy<00:03:19.940> it<00:03:20.940> does<00:03:21.210> take<00:03:21.450> care<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.900> get

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
look as cloudy it does take care and get

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.750 
look as cloudy it does take care and get
rid<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.290> some<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.740> parasites<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
rid of some of the parasites and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.500 
rid of some of the parasites and
bacteria<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.500> only<00:03:26.250> some<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.210> you're<00:03:27.360> really

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
bacteria but only some so you're really

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.670 
bacteria but only some so you're really
going<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.930> make<00:03:28.110> sure<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.380> heat<00:03:28.530> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
going to want to make sure to heat this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200 
going to want to make sure to heat this
water<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.340> do<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:29.940> it's<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.180> a

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
water if you do this so it's like a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.260 
water if you do this so it's like a
two-stage<00:03:30.660> process<00:03:31.100> first<00:03:32.100> BioSand<00:03:32.850> filter

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
two-stage process first BioSand filter

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.390 
two-stage process first BioSand filter
and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:34.050> heat<00:03:34.320> up<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.560> water<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.890> 150

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
and then heat up the water to 150

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.510 
and then heat up the water to 150
somehow<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.990> three<00:03:37.230> videos<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.860> show

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
somehow I have three videos that show

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.980 
somehow I have three videos that show
three<00:03:38.760> different<00:03:39.000> ways<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.300> do<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.810> can

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
three different ways to do that you can

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.410 
three different ways to do that you can
use<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> solar<00:03:40.620> box<00:03:40.890> cooker<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.090> can<00:03:42.270> use<00:03:42.390> a

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
use a solar box cooker you can use a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.140 
use a solar box cooker you can use a
parabolic<00:03:43.080> solar<00:03:43.830> cooker<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.580> can<00:03:44.760> use<00:03:44.940> one

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
parabolic solar cooker you can use one

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.930 
parabolic solar cooker you can use one
of<00:03:45.180> those<00:03:46.790> black<00:03:47.790> garden<00:03:48.150> hose<00:03:48.410> water<00:03:49.410> heaters

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
of those black garden hose water heaters

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.790 
of those black garden hose water heaters
you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> see<00:03:51.270> that<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.900> video<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.590> have

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
you can see that in the video I have

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.070 
you can see that in the video I have
posted<00:03:53.190> already<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:54.450> will<00:03:54.540> need<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.840> get<00:03:54.960> this

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
posted already you will need to get this

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.260 
posted already you will need to get this
one<00:03:55.320> or<00:03:55.440> two<00:03:55.590> 150<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.460> when<00:03:56.700> once<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:56.970> get<00:03:57.180> it

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
one or two 150 is when once you get it

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.660 
one or two 150 is when once you get it
to<00:03:57.360> 150<00:03:58.020> degrees<00:03:58.290> Fahrenheit<00:03:58.550> you're<00:03:59.550> going

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
to 150 degrees Fahrenheit you're going

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.640 
to 150 degrees Fahrenheit you're going
to<00:03:59.730> kill<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.150> living<00:04:00.450> things<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.870> there<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.290> lot

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
to kill all living things in there a lot

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.860 
to kill all living things in there a lot
of<00:04:01.740> stuff<00:04:01.950> actually<00:04:02.310> dies<00:04:02.490> at<00:04:02.670> about<00:04:02.850> 130<00:04:03.390> and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
of stuff actually dies at about 130 and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.110 
of stuff actually dies at about 130 and
a<00:04:04.110> bunch<00:04:04.320> more<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.680> 140<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.550> basically<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
a bunch more at 140 and basically the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.450 
a bunch more at 140 and basically the
rest<00:04:06.330> at<00:04:06.510> 150<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.590> consider<00:04:07.950> water<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.370> be

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
rest at 150 they consider water to be

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.700 
rest at 150 they consider water to be
pasteurized<00:04:08.730> at<00:04:09.210> 150<00:04:09.810> degrees<00:04:10.050> Fahrenheit<00:04:10.080> so

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
pasteurized at 150 degrees Fahrenheit so

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.360 
pasteurized at 150 degrees Fahrenheit so
there<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.270> that<00:04:12.270> looks<00:04:12.450> pretty<00:04:12.600> good<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.930> me

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
there it is that looks pretty good to me

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.440 
there it is that looks pretty good to me
by<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.430> way<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.850> bottle<00:04:15.150> was<00:04:15.300> 75<00:04:15.810> cents<00:04:17.450> thus

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
by the way the bottle was 75 cents thus

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.750 
by the way the bottle was 75 cents thus
and<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.900> actually<00:04:19.109> bought<00:04:19.560> at<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> nursery<00:04:20.340> for

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
and I actually bought at a nursery for

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.420 
and I actually bought at a nursery for
about<00:04:21.000> $4<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.900> live<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.620> desert<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.130> had<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.310> buy

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
about $4 I live in a desert I had to buy

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.380 
about $4 I live in a desert I had to buy
sand<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.600> up<00:04:24.690> with<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.950> very

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
sand it's up with that so very

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.060 
sand it's up with that so very
inexpensive<00:04:27.390> cleans<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> water<00:04:28.560> pretty<00:04:28.800> well

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
inexpensive cleans the water pretty well

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.310 
inexpensive cleans the water pretty well
I<00:04:29.370> won't<00:04:30.000> say<00:04:30.210> perfect<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.170> definitely

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
I won't say perfect but it definitely

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.730 
I won't say perfect but it definitely
cleans<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.950> pretty<00:04:32.190> well<00:04:32.400> it's<00:04:33.360> done<00:04:33.740> nothing

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
cleans it pretty well it's done nothing

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:46.570 
cleans it pretty well it's done nothing
left<00:04:34.920> in<00:04:35.130> there

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.580 

I<00:04:46.669> just<00:04:47.330> moved<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.629> up<00:04:47.720> onto<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.139> ledge<00:04:48.319> of<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
I just moved it up onto the ledge of the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.860 
I just moved it up onto the ledge of the
sink
