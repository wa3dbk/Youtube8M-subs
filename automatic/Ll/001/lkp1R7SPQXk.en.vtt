00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
pretty much Aaron said like that's not

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.350 
pretty much Aaron said like that's not
even<00:05:06.220> if<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.490> were<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.639> happen<00:05:06.699> which<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.240> is

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
even if that were to happen which it is

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.879 
even if that were to happen which it is
happening<00:05:07.660> but<00:05:07.900> that's<00:05:08.260> not<00:05:08.470> changing

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
happening but that's not changing

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.400 
happening but that's not changing
anything<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.789> yeah<00:05:10.210> that's<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.840> very<00:05:11.020> naive

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
anything but yeah that's a very naive

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.110 
anything but yeah that's a very naive
notion<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:12.010> think<00:05:12.250> if<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.370> actually<00:05:12.699> happened

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
notion I think if that actually happened

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.820 
notion I think if that actually happened
to<00:05:13.150> real<00:05:13.330> life<00:05:13.360> an<00:05:13.750> alien<00:05:14.050> invasion<00:05:14.320> it

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
to real life an alien invasion it

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.950 
to real life an alien invasion it
wouldn't<00:05:15.669> go<00:05:15.820> as<00:05:15.940> smoothly<00:05:16.240> as<00:05:16.419> some<00:05:16.660> people

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
wouldn't go as smoothly as some people

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.439 
wouldn't go as smoothly as some people
like<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.110> thank<00:05:17.789> humans<00:05:18.789> wouldn't<00:05:19.030> all<00:05:19.210> just

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
like to thank humans wouldn't all just

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.490 
like to thank humans wouldn't all just
come<00:05:19.630> together<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.110> forget<00:05:20.260> their

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
come together and forget their

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.140 
come together and forget their
differences<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.070> fight<00:05:21.400> aliens<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:22.000> mean

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
differences and fight aliens I mean

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.290 
differences and fight aliens I mean
maybe<00:05:23.050> there<00:05:23.289> is<00:05:23.410> something<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.520> that<00:05:24.850> effect

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
maybe there is something to that effect

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.689 
maybe there is something to that effect
but<00:05:25.419> not<00:05:25.720> not<00:05:26.020> completely<00:05:26.500> anyway<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.580> that

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
but not not completely anyway so that

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:28.590 
but not not completely anyway so that
was<00:05:27.789> another<00:05:27.850> interesting<00:05:28.389> thing<00:05:28.419> this

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
was another interesting thing this

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.870
