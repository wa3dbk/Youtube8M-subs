the audio device series but this week I

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.839 
the audio device series but this week I
decided<00:00:07.290> I'm<00:00:07.410> gonna<00:00:07.470> take<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> break<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.280> wanted

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849

decided I'm gonna take a break I wanted
to<00:00:08.910> do<00:00:09.030> tutorial<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:11.010> choke

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
to do tutorial today on the choke

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.499 
to do tutorial today on the choke
feature<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> drum<00:00:12.030> racks<00:00:12.240> cuz<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
feature with the drum racks cuz I

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.629 
feature with the drum racks cuz I
recently<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.259> kinda<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.130> started<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> side

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
recently I kinda have started a side

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.160 
recently I kinda have started a side
project<00:00:14.849> or<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.570> hip-hop<00:00:15.750> stuff

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
project or just do like hip-hop stuff

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.490 
project or just do like hip-hop stuff
lately<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.660> had<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.779> learn<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.230> use<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
lately and I had to learn how to use the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.080 
lately and I had to learn how to use the
choke<00:00:19.680> features<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.250> had<00:00:20.369> never<00:00:20.730> used<00:00:21.000> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
choke features I had never used it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730 
choke features I had never used it
before<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.390> essentially<00:00:22.350> what<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> choke

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
before so essentially what the choke

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.230 
before so essentially what the choke
feature<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.310> gonna<00:00:23.400> open<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> drum<00:00:24.060> rack

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
feature is I'm gonna open up a drum rack

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.359 
feature is I'm gonna open up a drum rack
that's<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> preset<00:00:25.230> from<00:00:25.859> live<00:00:26.099> that's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that's just a preset from live that's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.390 
that's just a preset from live that's
already<00:00:26.580> set<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.769> these<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:28.830> choke

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
already set up and these are choke

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
already set up and these are choke
features<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:29.910> used<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> drum<00:00:30.420> machines<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
features when used on drum machines for

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
features when used on drum machines for
a<00:00:31.230> long<00:00:31.439> time<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> essentially<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> does

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a long time and essentially what it does

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.479 
a long time and essentially what it does
let<00:00:33.570> me<00:00:33.719> open<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.980> hurry<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.309> already

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
let me open this up a hurry it's already

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.380 
let me open this up a hurry it's already
open<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.820> okay<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.430> basically<00:00:38.430> when<00:00:39.270> you're

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
open up okay so basically when you're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
open up okay so basically when you're
playing<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> drum<00:00:39.840> set<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.200> real<00:00:40.320> life<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.010> have

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
playing a drum set in real life you have

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
playing a drum set in real life you have
an<00:00:41.250> open<00:00:41.489> house<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> hat<00:00:42.120> you'd<00:00:42.930> see

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
an open house you have a hat you'd see

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
an open house you have a hat you'd see
they're<00:00:43.140> gonna<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.379> open<00:00:43.620> or<00:00:43.739> closed<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
they're gonna be open or closed but it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.840 
they're gonna be open or closed but it
can't<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.809> hit<00:00:46.410> open<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.070> closed<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> same

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
can't be hit open and closed at the same

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
can't be hit open and closed at the same
time<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.870> essentially<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.980> times

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
time so essentially like a lot of times

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.729 
time so essentially like a lot of times
this<00:00:50.370> choke<00:00:50.610> feature<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.210> used<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.500> closed

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this choke feature is used on the closed

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
this choke feature is used on the closed
hat<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> open<00:00:53.610> hat<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
hat and the open hat so that when you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.740 
hat and the open hat so that when you
play<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.260> open<00:00:55.680> hat<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> closed<00:00:57.539> hat

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
play the open hat or a closed hat

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.510 
play the open hat or a closed hat
they're<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:58.020> cut<00:00:58.559> each<00:00:58.680> other<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.370> make

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
they're gonna cut each other off to make

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
they're gonna cut each other off to make
it<00:00:59.640> more<00:00:59.760> natural<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.989> let's<00:01:01.410> see

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it more natural so if I play let's see

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
it more natural so if I play let's see
we're<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> ki<00:01:02.129> age<00:01:02.430> sharp<00:01:03.300> 1<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.790> F

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we're in ki age sharp 1 so and then F

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.170 
we're in ki age sharp 1 so and then F
sharp<00:01:06.030> 1<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.369> hear<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:08.970> hit

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sharp 1 so you can hear that when I hit

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.070 
sharp 1 so you can hear that when I hit
those<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.409> hold<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.790> open<00:01:11.939> hat<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
those if I just hold the open hat it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
those if I just hold the open hat it
plays<00:01:13.979> through<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.610> hit<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.150> closed

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
plays through but if I hit the closed

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.340 
plays through but if I hit the closed
hat<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.140> same<00:01:16.290> time<00:01:16.880> it'll<00:01:17.880> cut<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> off<00:01:19.140> or

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
hat at the same time it'll cut it off or

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
hat at the same time it'll cut it off or
choke<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> stop<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> works<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
choke it to stop so how this works is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.420 
choke it to stop so how this works is
what<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> had<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> learn<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> didn't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
what I had to learn so I didn't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.990 
what I had to learn so I didn't
understand<00:01:24.950> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.640> features

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
understand if you go to these features

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
understand if you go to these features
to<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.630> though<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> had<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to get to this though if you just had it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.160 
to get to this though if you just had it
open<00:01:28.890> normally<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.840> need<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> go

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
open normally like that you need to go

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109 
open normally like that you need to go
to<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> second<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.909> need<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to this second one and you need to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
to this second one and you need to
actually<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.750> aisle<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.500> selected

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
actually this aisle won't be selected

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
actually this aisle won't be selected
either<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.150> part

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
either so you need to go to this part

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.850 
either so you need to go to this part
right<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> hit<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> i/o<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
right here and hit the i/o and then it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
right here and hit the i/o and then it
will<00:01:37.979> open<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.670> different<00:01:38.970> options<00:01:39.329> for

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
will open up the different options for

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.100 
will open up the different options for
each<00:01:39.860> chant<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.009> each<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:42.110> pad

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
each chant like each little pad

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.520 
each chant like each little pad
essentially<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> shows

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
essentially so if you go to it it shows

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
essentially so if you go to it it shows
like<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.979> has<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> choke<00:01:47.460> section<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> most<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
like it has a choke section and most of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
like it has a choke section and most of
them<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.630> none<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
them have none but as you can see the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
them have none but as you can see the
closed<00:01:49.979> hat<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> open<00:01:50.520> hat<00:01:50.700> habit<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
closed hat in the open hat habit and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.230 
closed hat in the open hat habit and
there's<00:01:51.780> none<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.530> 16<00:01:53.130> choices<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
there's none or 16 choices and these and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
there's none or 16 choices and these and
I<00:01:54.630> first<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> confused<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.040> how<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I first was kind of confused on how to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.580 
I first was kind of confused on how to
use<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.110> 16

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
use this because you know there are 16

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
use this because you know there are 16
pads<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.790> what<00:01:59.939> kind<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
pads here so that's what kind of

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
pads here so that's what kind of
confused<00:02:00.509> me<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> do<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
confused me but what you do is you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.690 
confused me but what you do is you
select<00:02:02.840> say<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.439> both<00:02:04.590> set<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
select say these are both set to one so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
select say these are both set to one so
you<00:02:05.790> could<00:02:06.060> essentially<00:02:06.540> set<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.020> these

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you could essentially set all of these

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
you could essentially set all of these
to<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.759> all<00:02:08.970> cut<00:02:09.300> each<00:02:09.509> other

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to one and they would all cut each other

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.490 
to one and they would all cut each other
off<00:02:09.810> basically

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
off basically

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.170 
off basically
I'm<00:02:11.680> all<00:02:11.770> set<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.550> anything<00:02:12.940> that's<00:02:13.090> on

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
I'm all set to one so anything that's on

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.840 
I'm all set to one so anything that's on
the<00:02:13.330> same<00:02:13.540> channel<00:02:13.990> choking<00:02:14.380> itself<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.920> going

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
the same channel choking itself is going

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.050 
the same channel choking itself is going
to<00:02:16.170> cut<00:02:17.170> itself<00:02:17.500> off<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> did<00:02:18.880> here

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
to cut itself off so what I did here

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.080 
to cut itself off so what I did here
with<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.540> kind<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.840> hip-hop<00:02:20.020> track<00:02:21.090> I've

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
with this kind of hip-hop track I've

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.430 
with this kind of hip-hop track I've
been<00:02:22.240> playing<00:02:22.420> around<00:02:22.540> 808<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.080> kind<00:02:23.410> of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
been playing around 808 and kind of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.690 
been playing around 808 and kind of
learning<00:02:23.680> how<00:02:23.800> they<00:02:23.920> tune<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.310> drums<00:02:24.520> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
learning how they tune the drums and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.840 
learning how they tune the drums and
stuff<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.980> kind<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.250> use<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.820> same

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
stuff so I just kind of use the same

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.060 
stuff so I just kind of use the same
kick<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.600> copied<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.230> bunch<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.560> times<00:02:29.770> and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
kick and copied it a bunch of times and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:39.449 
kick and copied it a bunch of times and
then<00:02:30.130> re<00:02:30.730> pitch<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.209> all<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.870> get<00:02:32.050> this

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.630

that anyways back to what we were
talking<00:03:16.340> about<00:03:16.640> here<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.180> basically<00:03:17.450> yeah

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
talking about here so basically yeah

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.229 
talking about here so basically yeah
what<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> did<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.410> set<00:03:18.680> all<00:03:18.890> these<00:03:19.250> kicks<00:03:19.580> to

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
what I did is I set all these kicks to

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.420 
what I did is I set all these kicks to
you<00:03:21.140> know<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.319> same<00:03:21.530> channels<00:03:21.920> choke<00:03:22.220> because

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
you know the same channels choke because

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.240 
you know the same channels choke because
if<00:03:22.670> you<00:03:22.790> didn't<00:03:23.120> have<00:03:23.360> them<00:03:23.630> choking<00:03:24.250> they

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
if you didn't have them choking they

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.650 
if you didn't have them choking they
would<00:03:25.430> play<00:03:25.670> through<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.299> would<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.420> get

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
would play through and it would just get

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.110 
would play through and it would just get
all<00:03:26.780> muddy<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.709> if<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.980> actually<00:03:28.519> take<00:03:28.940> these

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
all muddy so if I actually take these

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.759 
all muddy so if I actually take these
first<00:03:29.420> two<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.049> can<00:03:30.230> hear<00:03:30.470> them<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.620> I'll

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
first two you can hear them and I'll

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.690 
first two you can hear them and I'll
actually<00:03:30.920> take<00:03:31.280> them<00:03:31.640> off<00:03:31.850> choke<00:03:32.239> stage<00:03:33.700> just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
actually take them off choke stage just

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.680 
actually take them off choke stage just
listen<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.180> these

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.110 

so<00:03:38.560> they<00:03:38.680> cut<00:03:38.890> each<00:03:39.010> other<00:03:39.220> off<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.640> let's<00:03:39.910> see

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
so they cut each other off so let's see

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.360 
so they cut each other off so let's see
it's<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.810> one<00:03:41.050> in<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.290> one<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.740> if<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.160> take

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
it's this one in this one so if I take

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.560 
it's this one in this one so if I take
these<00:03:42.580> both<00:03:42.790> off<00:03:43.060> choke<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:46.150> can<00:03:46.300> hear

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
these both off choke and you can hear

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.390 
these both off choke and you can hear
it's<00:03:46.690> gonna<00:03:46.780> turn<00:03:46.990> into<00:03:47.050> kind<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.590> mess

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920 

and<00:03:52.400> you're<00:03:52.610> just<00:03:52.760> getting<00:03:53.030> tons<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.510> phasing

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
and you're just getting tons of phasing

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.810 
and you're just getting tons of phasing
now<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.320> they're<00:03:54.410> not<00:03:54.440> cutting<00:03:55.430> off<00:03:55.610> like

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
now and they're not cutting off like

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.150 
now and they're not cutting off like
this<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> good<00:03:56.840> way<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.020> do<00:03:57.200> this<00:03:57.380> because<00:03:57.950> if

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
this is a good way to do this because if

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.980 
this is a good way to do this because if
you<00:03:58.520> do<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.880> this<00:03:59.030> way<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.300> can<00:03:59.570> choke<00:03:59.810> them

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
you do it this way you can choke them

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.300 
you do it this way you can choke them
with<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> drum<00:04:00.380> rack<00:04:00.500> or<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.160> just

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
with the drum rack or you can just

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.740 
with the drum rack or you can just
bounce<00:04:01.460> them<00:04:01.700> down<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.940> audio<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.510> just

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
bounce them down to audio but I just

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.210 
bounce them down to audio but I just
kind<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.020> like<00:04:03.200> working<00:04:03.560> with<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.770> drum<00:04:03.950> racks

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
kind of like working with the drum racks

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.640 
kind of like working with the drum racks
so<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.300> was<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.450> really<00:04:05.660> quick<00:04:05.930> tutorial<00:04:06.080> I

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
so this was a really quick tutorial I

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.840 
so this was a really quick tutorial I
just<00:04:06.890> kind<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.100> wanted<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.340> go<00:04:07.490> over<00:04:07.730> this

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
just kind of wanted to go over this

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.950

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
feature because it was something that I

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960 
feature because it was something that I
just<00:04:09.230> had<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.530> learn<00:04:09.710> how<00:04:09.860> to<00:04:09.890> use<00:04:10.130> recently

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
just had to learn how to use recently

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.310

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.360 
really I've put stuff in drum racks
before<00:04:15.020> but<00:04:15.260> I've<00:04:15.410> never<00:04:15.560> had<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.890> sit<00:04:16.220> there

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370
