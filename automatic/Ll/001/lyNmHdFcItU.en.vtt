00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.219
 hello dear people here is everything again 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.990
 extremely team now in the new and last 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.939
 video in the old year we want you 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.240
 show how to clean your carburetor 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.840
 you can step 1 you have the carburetor 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.059
 Remove 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.099
 It's best if you go with it 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.619
 then you have enough space to 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.059
 otherwise you have to work the service 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.800
 use the flap in the helmet compartment 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.630
 then you turn the screws on the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.329
 pinch out so that you have the hoses 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 that come from the air filter and from the heart 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.260
 could pull off 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 next in gt is the first one 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.480
 cap off then he quotes with 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.550
 attached to a kind of small book prices 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.720
 secured with a small screw 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.720
 you just have to pull it out 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.330
 Now you can just do the job 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.330
 pull out 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.500
 Now we see the gas-guzzler 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 this goes laterally in the carburetor 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 the automatic petrol tap does not know 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 should close that was with us 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.270
 unfortunately the case 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.940
 just clip the hose with one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.039
 but next we'll pull that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.819
 carburetor off the intake manifold so that we 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.819
 can work better 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.420
 Now we are going to cut the gas here 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.040
 This hits the very front 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.019
 then you can do the steel rope with something 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.190
 skill through the gap in the circle 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.019
 lead and it goes out next 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.670
 unscrewed the front mother and 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.670
 pull the rope forward to guide us 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.360
 Now you have to do the finishing touches 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.540
 deduction then you have the first step 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.540
 made 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 Now we open the float chamber 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.130
 under the swimmer's chamber put the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.630
 Both solve the front nozzle is the 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.950
 beside and the back had these 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.000
 substances that out on this and makes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.880
 everything as in the video 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.040
 we have not used 40 of the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.810
 besides that made the exact same 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.930
 then the cover of the floats 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.700
 you can pay attention to that again 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.740
 no dirt or foreign body in the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.740
 come carburetor that is extremely important 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.570
 if we did that, we open 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.570
 the gold-colored lids 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.810
 underneath sits the membrane and the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.810
 float needle 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.210
 Removed the covers, the fault is gone 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.080
 and carefully pull the black ones 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.080
 membrane off 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.170
 Feels some oil in the opening and lets 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.170
 run it out again 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.310
 now you have the membrane and the 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.230
 re-insert the needle 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.660
 very sensitive so she bends up 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.860
 no case works carefully and 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.860
 do not push the needle up 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.210
 the membranes must be used exactly in the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.120
 if you make the lid on it again 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.580
 which is extremely important also likely 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.960
 Never enter the membrane 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.880
 or to pierce holes 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.979
 if you are so far that you cover the lid 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.080
 you can put on it before that 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.060
 spring back in the hole the feather must 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.260
 on or over the small one 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.460
 his hill in the lid 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.460
 as a direct middle 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.570
 then just look at the screws 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.570
 Clear again 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.480
 then you build everything in reverse 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.520
 order together again 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.200
 when everything is assembled and 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.970
 you have to control a couple of man 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.070
 step into the shaker and if we do everything 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.070
 have done right would start up 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.830
 so that 's it with our little one 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.229
 tutorial it will be the last video 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.699
 but it could be for this year 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.319
 be that we have a kind in winter 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.419
 special because we have a suzuki 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.590
 he restored 50 before or 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.840
 want to beautify something 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.449
 when and if that will come I can 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.740
 unfortunately nothing at the time has fallen 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.229
 Let's look forward to a thumbs up 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.750
 my comments or an abo to the 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.930
 days skin row new rollers extreme 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.930
