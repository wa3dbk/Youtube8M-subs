and here I'm going to job guys how to
make<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.049> batteries<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.450> basically<00:02:07.450> first

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
make the batteries and basically first

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.600 
make the batteries and basically first
put<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.190> aluminium<00:02:09.880> foil<00:02:10.600> right<00:02:11.410> there<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
put the aluminium foil right there and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.690 
put the aluminium foil right there and
next<00:02:13.090> put<00:02:13.420> your<00:02:13.630> fabric<00:02:14.020> sheets<00:02:15.900> above<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
next put your fabric sheets above the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.130 
next put your fabric sheets above the
aluminum<00:02:18.700> foil<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:20.250> lastly<00:02:21.250> put<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.140> carbon

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
aluminum foil and lastly put the carbon

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.850 
aluminum foil and lastly put the carbon
 on<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.140> how<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.650> it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
after that you put this pattern lid on

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
after that you put this pattern lid on
it<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.830> now<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.480> show<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.690> guys

great and you put the blue wires which

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.370 
great and you put the blue wires which
is<00:02:50.140> negative<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:53.140> blue<00:02:54.959> there's<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.170> sign

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
is negative on the blue there's a sign

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.520 
is negative on the blue there's a sign
which<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.680> B<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.580> while<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:01.120> great<00:03:01.569> coils<00:03:02.260> it

the sunlight and this is a fabric
and<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.760> is<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.210> carbon<00:04:10.810> sheets<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.410> of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
and this is the carbon sheets and of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.150 
and this is the carbon sheets and of
course<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> aluminium<00:04:13.210> is<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> bit<00:04:14.160> mixed

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
course the aluminium is a bit mixed

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.470 
course the aluminium is a bit mixed
with<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.490> carbon<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:17.459> yeah<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.820> changed

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
with the carbon and yeah it changed

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.400 
with the carbon and yeah it changed
color<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:21.519> course<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.910> dry<00:04:22.150> rot<00:04:22.420> and<00:04:22.570> you
