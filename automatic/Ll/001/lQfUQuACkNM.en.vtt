so<00:00:06.350> today<00:00:06.620> we're<00:00:06.800> going<00:00:06.920> to<00:00:07.010> be<00:00:07.160> installing<00:00:08.029> a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
so today we're going to be installing a

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.140 
so today we're going to be installing a
heavy-duty<00:00:10.910> diverter<00:00:11.450> valve<00:00:12.010> onto<00:00:13.010> a<00:00:13.190> 2008

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
heavy-duty diverter valve onto a 2008

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.660 
heavy-duty diverter valve onto a 2008
out<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:15.500> part<00:00:15.709> number<00:00:15.740> for<00:00:15.980> this<00:00:16.219> is<00:00:17.440> H

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
out and the part number for this is H

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.370 
out and the part number for this is H
one<00:00:19.670> four<00:00:20.000> five<00:00:20.330> seven<00:00:20.770> one<00:00:21.770> zero<00:00:22.010> D<00:00:23.380> and

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
one four five seven one zero D and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.950 
one four five seven one zero D and
here's<00:00:24.620> what<00:00:24.800> it's<00:00:24.920> going<00:00:24.950> to<00:00:25.070> look<00:00:25.160> like

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
here's what it's going to look like

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.090 
here's what it's going to look like
basically<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.170> is<00:00:27.290> going<00:00:27.440> to<00:00:27.500> be<00:00:27.620> mounted<00:00:27.770> on

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
basically this is going to be mounted on

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.590 
basically this is going to be mounted on
the<00:00:28.220> exhaust<00:00:28.460> manifold<00:00:29.030> right<00:00:29.210> next<00:00:29.450> to<00:00:29.510> the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
the exhaust manifold right next to the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.660 
the exhaust manifold right next to the
turbo<00:00:29.930> it's<00:00:30.650> going<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:30.890> be<00:00:30.950> held<00:00:31.190> in<00:00:31.280> by<00:00:31.430> three

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
turbo it's going to be held in by three

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.410 
turbo it's going to be held in by three
hex<00:00:31.850> nuts<00:00:32.090> bolts<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:33.730> this<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:34.850> basically<00:00:35.059> the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
hex nuts bolts and this is basically the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.810 
hex nuts bolts and this is basically the
updated<00:00:35.840> style<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:36.440> it's<00:00:36.620> designed<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.640> last

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
updated style so it's designed to last

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.869 
updated style so it's designed to last
you<00:00:38.659> know<00:00:38.749> pretty<00:00:38.989> much<00:00:39.079> life<00:00:39.469> of<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.739> vehicle

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
you know pretty much life of the vehicle

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.189 
you know pretty much life of the vehicle
unlike<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:40.999> previous<00:00:41.179> design<00:00:41.570> versions

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
unlike the previous design versions

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.180 
unlike the previous design versions
which<00:00:42.969> or<00:00:43.969> not<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.510> heavy-duty<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
which or not that heavy-duty so the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.380 
which or not that heavy-duty so the
first<00:00:46.370> thing<00:00:46.489> we're<00:00:46.609> going<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.789> do<00:00:46.909> is<00:00:47.030> jack<00:00:47.239> up

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
first thing we're going to do is jack up

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.920 
first thing we're going to do is jack up
the<00:00:47.480> car

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930 

okay<00:00:52.930> so<00:00:52.989> now<00:00:53.320> we're<00:00:53.530> underneath<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.489> vehicle

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
okay so now we're underneath the vehicle

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.790 
okay so now we're underneath the vehicle
the<00:00:55.090> vehicles<00:00:55.449> jacked<00:00:55.840> up<00:00:56.079> it's<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.500> jack

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the vehicles jacked up it's on jack

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
the vehicles jacked up it's on jack
stands<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:58.329> you'll<00:00:58.510> notice<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.140> we

stands which you'll notice is that we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070 
stands which you'll notice is that we
the<00:01:02.350> firewall<00:01:02.949> here<00:01:03.659> here's<00:01:04.659> going<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.900> be<00:01:04.989> our

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the firewall here here's going to be our

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.870 
the firewall here here's going to be our
turbocharger<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:07.920> basically<00:01:08.920> our<00:01:09.250> diverter

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
turbocharger and basically our diverter

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.539 
turbocharger and basically our diverter
valve<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.360> going<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.600> be<00:01:10.690> right<00:01:10.930> here<00:01:11.290> with<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
valve is going to be right here with a

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.100 
valve is going to be right here with a
two<00:01:13.090> wire<00:01:13.240> plug<00:01:13.600> connected<00:01:14.049> into<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.440> now<00:01:16.110> what

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
two wire plug connected into it now what

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.980 
two wire plug connected into it now what
you'll<00:01:17.289> notice<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.570> there's<00:01:19.570> going<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
you'll notice is that there's going to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.740 
you'll notice is that there's going to
be<00:01:20.080> three<00:01:20.470> hex<00:01:20.890> nuts<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:22.119> are<00:01:22.180> going<00:01:22.539> to<00:01:22.600> be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
be three hex nuts that are going to be

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.029 
be three hex nuts that are going to be
screwed<00:01:22.990> into<00:01:23.320> there<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.590> here's<00:01:23.860> our

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
screwed into there and here's our

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.880 
screwed into there and here's our
diverter<00:01:24.789> valve<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.300> old<00:01:25.479> one<00:01:25.690> now<00:01:26.530> what

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
diverter valve the old one now what

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.200 
diverter valve the old one now what
we're<00:01:27.070> going<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.250> do<00:01:27.429> is<00:01:27.610> we're<00:01:27.789> just<00:01:27.820> going<00:01:28.119> to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
we're going to do is we're just going to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.320 
we're going to do is we're just going to
simply<00:01:28.570> remove<00:01:29.229> those<00:01:29.590> three<00:01:30.130> hex<00:01:30.700> nuts<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
simply remove those three hex nuts and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.200 
simply remove those three hex nuts and
that'll<00:01:32.080> basically<00:01:32.259> allow<00:01:33.250> us<00:01:33.429> to<00:01:33.640> remove<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
that'll basically allow us to remove the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.690 
that'll basically allow us to remove the
diverter<00:01:34.690> valve<00:01:35.050> and<00:01:35.950> screw<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> new<00:01:36.460> place

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
diverter valve and screw the new place

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.740 
diverter valve and screw the new place
so<00:01:37.390> that's<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:37.750> we're<00:01:37.899> going<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.050> do<00:01:38.229> now

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.720 

all<00:01:47.750> right<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.140> basically<00:01:48.680> we've<00:01:49.160> removed<00:01:49.550> the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
all right so basically we've removed the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.570 
all right so basically we've removed the
diverter<00:01:50.180> valve<00:01:50.860> it's<00:01:51.860> held<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:52.130> by<00:01:52.190> three

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
diverter valve it's held in by three

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.780 
diverter valve it's held in by three
bolts<00:01:53.030> they're<00:01:53.870> t5<00:01:54.320> s<00:01:54.590> basically<00:01:55.520> you'll

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
bolts they're t5 s basically you'll

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.500 
bolts they're t5 s basically you'll
remove<00:01:56.120> those<00:01:57.130> unclip<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.280> plug<00:01:58.490> here<00:01:58.820> you

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
remove those unclip the plug here you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.120 
remove those unclip the plug here you
might<00:01:59.690> need<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.870> flathead<00:02:00.320> screwdriver<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.980> pry

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
might need a flathead screwdriver to pry

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.300 
might need a flathead screwdriver to pry
it<00:02:01.190> out<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> then<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.290> unit<00:02:03.620> slides<00:02:03.890> out<00:02:04.070> very

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
it out and then the unit slides out very

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.610 
it out and then the unit slides out very
easily<00:02:04.550> what<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.930> now<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:06.470> can

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
easily what we can do now is we can

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.930 
easily what we can do now is we can
actually<00:02:06.740> check<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.250> see<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:07.760> was

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually check to see if this was

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.480 
actually check to see if this was
actually<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.330> favor<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.720> valve<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.979> check

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
actually a favor to valve is a check

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.100 
actually a favor to valve is a check
engine<00:02:10.670> light<00:02:10.880> code<00:02:11.380> p0<00:02:12.380> 299<00:02:13.190> for

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
engine light code p0 299 for

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.280 
engine light code p0 299 for
turbocharger<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.290> sufficient<00:02:15.800> boost<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
turbocharger and sufficient boost and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.330 
turbocharger and sufficient boost and
basically<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.800> do<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.040> these<00:02:19.160> are

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
basically what we can do is these are

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.080 
basically what we can do is these are
actually<00:02:19.490> removable<00:02:20.420> as<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.990> can<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.090> we

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
actually removable as you can see and we

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.940 
actually removable as you can see and we
can<00:02:23.240> actually<00:02:23.390> remove<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.380> inspect<00:02:24.800> it

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
can actually remove this and inspect it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
to see what kind of damage we have and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.650 
to see what kind of damage we have and
as<00:02:27.140> I'm<00:02:27.920> opening<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.580> up<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.970> first<00:02:29.300> thing<00:02:29.540> I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
as I'm opening this up the first thing I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.610 
as I'm opening this up the first thing I
notice<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.800> I've<00:02:30.950> got<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> big<00:02:31.459> tear<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.180> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
notice so I've got a big tear here and

notice so I've got a big tear here and
basically<00:02:33.620> what<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.160> tear<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.640> gonna<00:02:34.850> do<00:02:35.000> is

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
basically what this tear is gonna do is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.350 
basically what this tear is gonna do is
it's<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.630> actually<00:02:36.670> reduce<00:02:37.670> your<00:02:38.060> boost

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
it's going to actually reduce your boost

it's going to actually reduce your boost
pressure<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:39.050> going<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.230> make<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.470> engine

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
pressure it's going to make the engine

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.190 
pressure it's going to make the engine
feel<00:02:40.130> much<00:02:40.400> more<00:02:40.610> sluggish<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.959> course

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
feel much more sluggish and of course

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
feel much more sluggish and of course
you'll<00:02:42.380> get<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.650> check<00:02:42.890> engine<00:02:43.250> light<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.510> so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
you'll get that check engine light on so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.830 
you'll get that check engine light on so

it's not going to be prone to the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.880 
it's not going to be prone to the
tearing<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.870> ripping<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.350> this<00:02:57.530> older
