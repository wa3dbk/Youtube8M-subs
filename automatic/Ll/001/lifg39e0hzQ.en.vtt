improvement there and when I'm
interesting<00:02:35.959> I'm<00:02:36.079> really<00:02:36.349> ingesting<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.129> sort

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
interesting I'm really ingesting it sort

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.520 
interesting I'm really ingesting it sort
of<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.609> dermal<00:02:38.030> subchief<00:02:38.540> border<00:02:38.989> we've<00:02:39.290> sort

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
of the dermal subchief border we've sort

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.059 
of the dermal subchief border we've sort
of<00:02:39.590> been<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.829> fat<00:02:40.159> layer<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.709> just<00:02:42.889> want

to<00:02:43.099> see<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> nice<00:02:43.549> plumping<00:02:44.389> and<00:02:44.480> finding

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
to see a nice plumping and finding

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.490 
to see a nice plumping and finding
effect<00:02:46.329> there's<00:02:47.329> also<00:02:47.540> some<00:02:47.900> numbing<00:02:48.109> in<00:02:48.349> this

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
effect there's also some numbing in this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:25.710 
effect there's also some numbing in this
poker<00:02:48.920> itself

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.450

more surface area but also prevent
collagen<00:04:15.340> bump<00:04:15.970> formation<00:04:16.660> which<00:04:16.870> we

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
collagen bump formation which we

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.750 
collagen bump formation which we
obviously<00:04:17.260> want<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.830> avoid<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.489> chest

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.520 
obviously want to avoid on the chest
area<00:04:18.970> which<00:04:19.360> is<00:04:19.510> uncommon<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.230> I've<00:04:20.380> actually

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.290 

I'm<00:04:45.020> gonna<00:04:45.170> focus<00:04:45.620> again<00:04:45.920> down<00:04:46.160> here<00:04:46.190> with<00:04:46.700> no

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
I'm gonna focus again down here with no

and after we're done we massage the
patients<00:04:55.830> firmly<00:04:56.460> in<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:56.940> chest<00:04:57.270> area<00:04:57.630> just

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
patients firmly in this chest area just

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.830 
patients firmly in this chest area just
to<00:04:57.990> distribute<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.770> product<00:04:59.509> and<00:05:00.509> then<00:05:00.690> I

little circles of firm pressure in that

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.950 
little circles of firm pressure in that
area<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.819> I<00:05:11.910> tell<00:05:12.150> them<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.449> not<00:05:12.599> so<00:05:12.810> much

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
area and I tell them it's not so much
