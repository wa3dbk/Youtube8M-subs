00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
some very basic patterns you can

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.290 
some very basic patterns you can
improvise<00:02:22.630> if<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.500> don't<00:02:23.800> know<00:02:24.520> exactly<00:02:25.060> what

thing<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.270> learned<00:02:34.480> from<00:02:34.750> doing<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.470> for<00:02:35.800> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
thing I learned from doing this for a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.550 
thing I learned from doing this for a
couple<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.400> years<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:37.000> dots<00:02:37.840> are<00:02:38.140> always<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
couple of years is dots are always a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.140 
couple of years is dots are always a
good<00:02:38.830> way<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.010> make<00:02:39.310> something<00:02:39.730> look<00:02:39.880> really

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
good way to make something look really

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.650 
good way to make something look really
nice<00:02:40.300> but<00:02:41.790> don't<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:42.970> all<00:02:43.150> dots<00:02:43.390> because

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
nice but don't do all dots because

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.110 
nice but don't do all dots because
that's<00:02:43.810> weird<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.320> I'm<00:02:45.100> wiping<00:02:45.340> off<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.730> tube

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that's weird so I'm wiping off the tube

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.200 
that's weird so I'm wiping off the tube
every<00:02:46.980> minute<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.940> make<00:02:49.150> sure

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
every minute or so just to make sure

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.480 
every minute or so just to make sure
that<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.600> end<00:02:49.780> isn't<00:02:50.080> called<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.800> with<00:02:51.130> henna

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
that the end isn't called up with henna

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.670 
that the end isn't called up with henna
that's<00:02:51.820> been<00:02:52.450> pushed<00:02:52.750> around<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.410> am<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
that's been pushed around I am going to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.610 
that's been pushed around I am going to
let<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:56.950> set<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.310> an<00:02:57.670> hour<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.320> then<00:02:59.500> what

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
let this set for an hour and then what

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.920 
let this set for an hour and then what
you<00:02:59.740> do<00:02:59.950> is<00:02:59.980> after<00:03:00.790> an<00:03:00.910> hour<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.450> letting<00:03:01.810> this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
you do is after an hour of letting this

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.790 
you do is after an hour of letting this
dry<00:03:02.230> you're<00:03:03.070> gonna<00:03:03.280> apply<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.360> lemon<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:05.230> your

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
dry you're gonna apply the lemon to your

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.370 
dry you're gonna apply the lemon to your
henna<00:03:06.070> tattoo<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.850> what<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.480> does<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.990> it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
henna tattoo and what that does is it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.310 
henna tattoo and what that does is it
darkens<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.100> pigment<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.030> henna<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.050> it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
darkens the pigment of the henna so it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.130 
darkens the pigment of the henna so it
that's<00:03:11.950> what<00:03:12.130> will<00:03:12.250> make<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.790> last<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.780> know<00:03:13.900> a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
that's what will make it last you know a

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.560 
that's what will make it last you know a
good<00:03:14.590> two<00:03:14.890> three<00:03:15.100> weeks<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.360> don't

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
good two three weeks and then you don't

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.080 
good two three weeks and then you don't
always<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.320> apply<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.190> lemon<00:03:18.550> but<00:03:19.000> if

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
always have to apply the lemon but if

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.970 
always have to apply the lemon but if
you<00:03:19.210> don't<00:03:19.510> keep<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:19.990> mind<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.650> tattoo

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.770 
you don't keep in mind that the tattoo
will<00:03:21.130> probably<00:03:21.490> fade<00:03:21.700> away<00:03:21.940> within<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.510> couple

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
will probably fade away within a couple

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.500 
will probably fade away within a couple
of<00:03:22.960> days<00:03:23.490> all<00:03:24.490> right<00:03:24.670> are<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.000> ready<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.330> see
