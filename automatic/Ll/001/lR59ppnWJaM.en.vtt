00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so well here that'll wait for this to

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.600 
so well here that'll wait for this to
drain<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.610> spin

assuming<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> rubber<00:01:14.100> plunger<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
assuming there's a rubber plunger at the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.170 
assuming there's a rubber plunger at the
bottom<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> shaft<00:01:15.920> that's<00:01:16.920> gone<00:01:17.250> bad<00:01:17.549> at

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
bottom of the shaft that's gone bad at

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.289 
bottom of the shaft that's gone bad at
least<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.020> hope<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.970> if<00:01:20.970> there's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
least that's what my hope is if there's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
least that's what my hope is if there's
something<00:01:21.659> else<00:01:21.780> wrong<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
so we're going to place that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.980 
so we're going to place that
right<00:04:59.349> together<00:05:00.479> after<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.509> little<00:05:01.629> running

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
right together after a little running

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.059 
right together after a little running
around<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.759> found<00:05:03.759> the<00:05:04.410> rubber<00:05:05.410> tip<00:05:05.830> that

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
around I found the rubber tip that

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.240 
around I found the rubber tip that
actually<00:05:06.400> fits<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:06.910> hydrant<00:05:08.220> luckily<00:05:09.220> I

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
actually fits this hydrant luckily I

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.180 
actually fits this hydrant luckily I
remembered<00:05:09.370> where<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.000> bought<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:11.190> because

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
remembered where I bought this because

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.230 
remembered where I bought this because
there<00:05:12.490> are<00:05:12.580> several<00:05:12.819> different

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
there are several different

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.050 
there are several different
manufacturers<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:14.259> would<00:05:14.409> have<00:05:14.819> you<00:05:15.819> have<00:05:16.030> a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
manufacturers you would have you have a

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.790 
manufacturers you would have you have a
little<00:05:16.270> trouble<00:05:16.509> finding<00:05:17.139> parts<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.710> you

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
little trouble finding parts that you

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.129 
little trouble finding parts that you
need<00:05:18.150> usually<00:05:19.150> all<00:05:19.300> these<00:05:19.539> hydrants<00:05:20.050> are

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
need usually all these hydrants are

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.159 
need usually all these hydrants are
marked<00:05:20.530> as<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.919> maker<00:05:21.159> of<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:21.789> you

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
marked as to the maker of it so you

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:29.300 
marked as to the maker of it so you
should<00:05:23.169> be<00:05:23.259> able<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:24.210> which<00:05:25.210> one<00:05:25.419> you're<00:05:25.569> after

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:37.939 

you<00:05:30.310> can<00:05:30.550> probably<00:05:30.879> use<00:05:31.360> teflon<00:05:31.960> tape<00:05:32.229> my

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.559 

problem<00:05:38.949> a<00:05:39.039> teflon<00:05:39.490> tape<00:05:39.789> is<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.150> don't<00:05:40.360> want

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
problem a teflon tape is you don't want

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.390 
problem a teflon tape is you don't want
to<00:05:40.690> tighten<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.319> up<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.650> then<00:05:41.770> have<00:05:41.949> to<00:05:41.979> end<00:05:42.280> up

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
to tighten it up and then have to end up

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.189 
to tighten it up and then have to end up
backing<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.060> up<00:05:43.180> because<00:05:43.569> then<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.810> lose<00:05:43.840> your

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
backing it up because then you lose your

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:51.379 
backing it up because then you lose your
seal<00:05:45.030> with<00:05:46.030> this<00:05:46.710> all<00:05:47.710> right<00:05:49.169> put<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.199> on

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
seal with this all right put that on

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.320 
seal with this all right put that on
both<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.750> female<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:53.949> male<00:05:54.159> parts<00:05:55.030> of<00:05:55.210> the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
both the female and male parts of the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:14.809 
both the female and male parts of the
pipe<00:06:00.449> symbol

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.709 

this<00:06:15.819> particular<00:06:16.240> new<00:06:16.830> seal<00:06:17.830> came<00:06:18.249> with<00:06:18.719> all

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
this particular new seal came with all

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.850 
this particular new seal came with all
these<00:06:19.990> new<00:06:20.259> parts<00:06:21.810> so<00:06:22.810> put<00:06:23.259> those<00:06:23.409> in<00:06:23.650> at<00:06:23.740> the

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
these new parts so put those in at the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.369 
these new parts so put those in at the
same<00:06:24.039> time<00:06:24.099> so<00:06:24.879> I<00:06:24.909> have<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.479> readjust<00:06:25.810> this

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
same time so I have to readjust this

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:55.189 
same time so I have to readjust this
plunger<00:06:26.979> once<00:06:27.400> we<00:06:27.639> get<00:06:27.789> that<00:06:28.499> tightened<00:06:29.499> up

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.260 

now<00:06:56.199> I'm<00:06:56.409> just<00:06:56.680> adjusting<00:06:56.830> the<00:06:57.310> thrill<00:06:58.090> of

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
now I'm just adjusting the thrill of

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.740 
now I'm just adjusting the thrill of
that<00:06:59.069> shaft<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:02.680> it<00:07:02.830> engages<00:07:03.250> the<00:07:04.180> rubber<00:07:04.419> down

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
that shaft so it engages the rubber down

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:22.930 
that shaft so it engages the rubber down
the<00:07:05.520> fitting<00:07:06.520> down<00:07:06.699> below

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.660 

we're<00:07:23.940> there

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:25.670 
we're there

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.430 
we're there
how<00:07:26.670> about<00:07:26.850> turn<00:07:27.120> the<00:07:27.240> water<00:07:27.420> back<00:07:27.540> on<00:07:27.870> it

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
how about turn the water back on it

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.610 
how about turn the water back on it
see<00:07:29.190> if<00:07:29.280> we<00:07:29.400> were<00:07:29.520> successful<00:07:29.810> all<00:07:30.810> right<00:07:31.260> get

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
see if we were successful all right get

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:47.540 
see if we were successful all right get
the<00:07:31.740> water<00:07:31.950> back<00:07:32.160> on<00:07:34.010> it's<00:07:35.010> not<00:07:35.250> coming<00:07:35.490> out

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.550 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.880 

believe<00:07:48.550> we<00:07:48.669> did<00:07:48.850> it
