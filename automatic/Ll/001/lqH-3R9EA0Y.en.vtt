00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
kills with my lightning strikes so if I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.810 
kills with my lightning strikes so if I
realized<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.250> doing<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
realized that I was doing this well I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.040 
realized that I was doing this well I
wouldn't<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.329> even<00:00:54.420> called<00:00:54.629> him<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
wouldn't have even called him the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
wouldn't have even called him the
lightning<00:00:55.350> strike<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> begin<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
lightning strike to begin with because I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.610 
lightning strike to begin with because I
you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> had<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:57.989> good<00:00:58.199> chance<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you know I had a pretty good chance to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
you know I had a pretty good chance to
get<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.980> nuke<00:00:59.309> doubt<00:00:59.489> title<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.420> begin<00:01:00.629> with

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
get this nuke doubt title to begin with

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
get this nuke doubt title to begin with
so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.530> probably<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.670> not<00:01:03.059> called

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
so I probably just would have not called

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
so I probably just would have not called
it<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.930> realize<00:01:04.320> by<00:01:04.530> didn't<00:01:04.739> realize<00:01:04.979> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

you<00:03:25.269> go<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.570> game<00:03:25.840> without<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.709> killstreak

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
you go to a game without a killstreak

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.040 
you go to a game without a killstreak
because<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.239> took<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.570> off<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.989> you're

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
because you just took it off and you're

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.630 
because you just took it off and you're
about<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.290> put<00:03:29.530> another<00:03:29.620> one<00:03:29.890> on<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.459> didn't

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
about to put another one on you didn't

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
about to put another one on you didn't
have<00:03:30.730> enough<00:03:30.820> time<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.420> would<00:03:31.510> have<00:03:31.600> been

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
have enough time so it would have been

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.000 
have enough time so it would have been
hilarious<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.320> took<00:03:32.380> off<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.680> lightning

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
hilarious if I took off the lightning

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.009 
hilarious if I took off the lightning
strike<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.940> didn't<00:03:34.510> have<00:03:34.600> enough<00:03:34.810> time<00:03:34.959> to

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
strike and I didn't have enough time to

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.110 
strike and I didn't have enough time to
put<00:03:35.709> another<00:03:35.890> kill<00:03:36.160> street<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.940> had<00:03:37.060> my

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.710 
here so
it<00:04:27.280> was<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.520> downhill<00:04:27.850> roller<00:04:28.120> coaster<00:04:28.540> so<00:04:28.690> I

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
it was the downhill roller coaster so I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.770 
it was the downhill roller coaster so I
liked<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.580> couple<00:04:31.060> tips<00:04:31.300> for<00:04:31.480> free<00:04:31.630> for

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
liked it and a couple tips for free for

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.540 
liked it and a couple tips for free for
all<00:04:31.840> real<00:04:32.020> quick<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.500> lot<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:32.950> people<00:04:33.100> think

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
all real quick a lot of people think

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.520 
all real quick a lot of people think
that<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.910> need<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.600> use<00:04:34.720> ghost<00:04:34.990> but<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.290> think

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
that you need to use ghost but I think

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.810 
that you need to use ghost but I think
the<00:04:35.620> opposite<00:04:36.040> i<00:04:36.130> think<00:04:36.370> goes<00:04:36.520> pretty

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the opposite i think goes pretty

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.820 
the opposite i think goes pretty
pointless<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.420> food<00:04:37.600> for<00:04:37.720> all<00:04:37.840> because<00:04:38.200> when

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
pointless and food for all because when

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.740 
pointless and food for all because when
someone<00:04:39.130> gets<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.460> UAV<00:04:39.730> like<00:04:40.060> i<00:04:40.150> understand<00:04:40.570> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
someone gets a UAV like i understand it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.210 
someone gets a UAV like i understand it
can<00:04:40.930> be<00:04:41.140> helpful<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.680> if<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.890> feel<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.190> need

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
can be helpful and if you feel the need

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.340 
can be helpful and if you feel the need
to<00:04:42.490> use<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.850> ahead<00:04:42.970> but<00:04:43.330> when<00:04:43.990> someone<00:04:44.260> gets

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
to use it go ahead but when someone gets

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.400 
to use it go ahead but when someone gets
UAV<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.130> they<00:04:45.700> call<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.210> not<00:04:46.900> only<00:04:47.110> are

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
UAV and they call it in not only are

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.690 
UAV and they call it in not only are
they<00:04:47.530> seeing<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:48.220> they're<00:04:48.340> seeing<00:04:48.550> the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
the chance of them actually going to

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.530 
the chance of them actually going to
kill<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.320> you're<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.100> little<00:04:54.280> dot<00:04:54.640> out<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.330> all

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
kill you you're a little dot out of all

it's<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.170> pretty<00:04:59.350> slim<00:04:59.620> chance<00:04:59.890> if<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.160> think

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
it's a pretty slim chance if you think

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.010
