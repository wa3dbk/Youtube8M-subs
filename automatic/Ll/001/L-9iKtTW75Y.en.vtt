00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 in song we will have the option to choose 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.040
 Between pumps or square tour and charm under 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.929
 based on gyms stats attacks 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.139
 who learns the pokemon and opponents of 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.150
 game we will come to a conclusion I made 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 this list that shows the advantages and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
 disadvantages of the three pokemones 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 initials when fighting in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 different singing places we started 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 with bombs or 1 at the time of fighting with 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.710
 your opponent for the second time is that he has 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 already a pitch that pumps or does not have 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.809
 no advantage but this fight is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.969
 optional 2 in the greater green forest 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.770
 amount of pokemones are insects and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.660
 this makes a lot of difference to the type 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 plant regardless of whether you come back or not 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.620
 poison as secondary because in those 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 levels that you'll have there there will not be any 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 poison type attack that will serve you a lot 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 3 has the advantage when it comes to fighting 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
 with brooke since his pokemones 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 they are earth type and grass attack 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.510
 return rosy an easy victory 4 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.370
 in the moon mountain we can find 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 pokemones like joe that if we do 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 effect but there are also ups that have 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.850
 air type attacks and can weaken us 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 fast our pokemon 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 5 when it comes to fighting for the third time 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.580
 with your opponent this has an open 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.680
 which does not matter because it only has 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 teletransportation but subtle and now it's 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.960
 a pilot and you will continue to be disadvantaged 6 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.909
 you have the advantage in the fight against my 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 you since your pokemones are water and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.780
 although they will be and be a psychic type 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.450
 has attacks of that type that is, 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.399
 has the advantage in the gym of 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.619
 thunder fought with pokemon is just from 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.539
 electrical type as expected 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.659
 that your battle will be normal against this 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.490
 character 8 in the fourth fight against you 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.369
 rival on the ship this has attacks 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 flying psychics and fire in this case 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.259
 so you will have many problems for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 these reasons pumps or it would be the worst 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.270
 choice from this point of view then 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 of this fight it is very difficult that only 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.220
 continue with a pokemon you'll have for 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.799
 at least 3 pokemons and it will no longer depend 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.860
 only from your initial pokemon 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.110
 continue with charm under 1 in your second 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.509
 fight against the opponent this one has a pil 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.800
 and which will have no advantages with you or 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.080
 you against him 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.570
 2 since the green forest possesses in its 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.490
 most pokemons type insect the type 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.310
 fire has a great advantage in this 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.410
 terrain 3 in the brooke gym at 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.590
 have rock pokemons the fire type 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.480
 has a great disadvantage 4 of the mount 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.310
 moon although you have to fight not to send 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.680
 it would be so bad because it would be normal 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.070
 against your clef bat and very effective 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.110
 against vargas 5 the third fight with you 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.330
 rival will not have much difference with the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.820
 second with the same as explained in 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.800
 basora ball portion and rat attack 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.890
 this opponent has in this fight is not 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.750
 No challenge 6 in the gym 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.430
 mishti, you have all the loses because 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.880
 his pokemons are water and very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.680
 powerful 7 in the surge gym will be 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.720
 a close fight since he only has 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 electric pokemons and fire and the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.850
 electricity are given normal 8 the fourth 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.890
 Once you fight with your opponent they have a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.940
 hard game thanks to the pokemones 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.070
 that your opponent has without counting his initial 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.250
 for these reasons charm under is in the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.100
 put number 2 we continue with square 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.900
 tun 1 when you fight for the second time 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.580
 against your opponent they have a game 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.520
 normal since your asks and does not make you 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.560
 effect 2 in the green forest you will not have 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.390
 problems since most pokemones 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.900
 that there are bug type and one another 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.550
 pikachu will not cause so many problems 3 a 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.650
 the time to fight against group you have 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.800
 the whole advantage because your pokemon is a 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.840
 rock type and earth 4 in the moon mount no 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.880
 you will have problems since you take effect 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.370
 the gods and the other pokemons are not 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.530
 annoyance for a square tool 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.690
 5 the third time you fight against your 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.200
 rival you have a fight not very complicated 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.060
 for reasons explained above 6 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.130
 Mishti in the gym should win 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.960
 but with small problems in some 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.120
 occasions depending on how you 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.490
 trained to your pokemon because the starter 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.680
 I'm the mistress and it's very strong 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.720
 7 in the fight against the leader of thunder 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.490
 is the only big problem that you will have already 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.350
 that all your pokemons are kind 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.590
 electric and if you do not have another pokemon 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.450
 it will be very difficult to pass 8 in the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.280
 fourth fight against your opponent you must already 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.830
 have at least hour torton with 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.450
 bite that learns at level 16 already 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.790
 that this is a dark type attack 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.300
 you will have the advantage against his word and 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.860
 affect us normal to your other pokemones 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.510
 after all this we have come to the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.700
 conclusion that square tuna is the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.980
 best option to choose as pokemon 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.980
 initial in the singing region with games 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.830
 like pokemon red green blue green leaf 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.110
 and fire red we can also take in 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.240
 account if we want a fast pokÃ©mon that 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.760
 resist or hit hard but this would be 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.880
 own decision here I leave you three 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.919
 tables so they think a tip would be 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.870
 that catch pokemons of different types 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.610
 while the cities are passing by and 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.800
 train them at your convenience 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.800
 for example catch a dilettante from 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:03.010
 the fight against arises this would be all 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.010
 I like it if it was like that I said goodbye
