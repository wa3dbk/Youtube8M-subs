fasting because I found you on the
internet<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.100> wanted<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.610> do<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> fast<00:00:49.060> I

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
internet and I wanted to do a fast I

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.850 
internet and I wanted to do a fast I
thought<00:00:49.630> first<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:50.080> would<00:00:50.200> do<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.320> water<00:00:50.560> fast

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
but then I got kind of afraid because it

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460 
but then I got kind of afraid because it
could<00:00:54.220> do<00:00:54.610> a<00:00:54.640> lot<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.880> damage<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.660> so<00:00:55.990> I<00:00:56.260> wanted

you're actually running marathons yeah
I'm<00:01:09.190> doing<00:01:09.310> my<00:01:09.490> first<00:01:09.640> marathon<00:01:09.909> this<00:01:10.420> summer

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I'm doing my first marathon this summer

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.190 
I'm doing my first marathon this summer
really<00:01:12.100> odd<00:01:12.490> oh<00:01:12.790> that's<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:13.570> great<00:01:13.780> so<00:01:14.140> it

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
really odd oh that's really great so it

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.450 
really odd oh that's really great so it
works

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.340 

initially<00:01:19.450> what<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.690> came<00:01:19.780> before<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.200> was

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
initially what it came before it was

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.870 
initially what it came before it was
weight<00:01:20.619> loss<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.570> big<00:01:23.140> question<00:01:23.880> how

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
weight loss so it's a big question how

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.440 
weight loss so it's a big question how
do<00:01:25.869> me<00:01:26.020> this<00:01:26.140> way<00:01:26.380> how<00:01:26.710> do<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.040> lose<00:01:27.390> cause<00:01:28.390> I

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
do me this way how do we lose cause I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.940 
do me this way how do we lose cause I
think<00:01:28.690> we<00:01:28.869> need<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.110> kind<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.350> break<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.770> down

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
think we need to kind of break it down

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.109 
think we need to kind of break it down
because<00:01:30.369> there<00:01:30.670> are<00:01:30.760> several<00:01:30.970> factors

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
because there are several factors

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.080 
because there are several factors
involved<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.140> your<00:01:32.320> weight<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.820> number

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
involved in your weight but the number

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.350 
involved in your weight but the number
one<00:01:34.240> factor<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.690> lot<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:36.150> discuss<00:01:37.150> those

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
one factor a lot I like to discuss those

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.570 
one factor a lot I like to discuss those
people<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:38.070> probably<00:01:39.070> one<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.460> most

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
people is probably one of the most

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.020 
people is probably one of the most
important<00:01:40.119> which<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.659> your<00:01:41.470> elimination

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.750 

I<00:01:45.260> actually<00:01:46.260> knew<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:47.010> your<00:01:47.159> mind<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.580> last

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that's not relatively simple to do when

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
that's not relatively simple to do when
you<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> colon<00:01:54.540> cleanse<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:55.140> isn't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

how that booms out of your system is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.250 
how that booms out of your system is
through<00:02:58.700> your<00:02:58.820> blood<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.270> your<00:02:59.720> left<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.170> you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
through your blood and your left so you

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.890 
through your blood and your left so you
gotta<00:03:00.410> move<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.550> lymphatic<00:03:02.120> system<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.690> don't

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
gotta move the lymphatic system I don't

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.180 
gotta move the lymphatic system I don't
know<00:03:02.990> if<00:03:03.080> everyone's<00:03:03.410> really<00:03:03.560> familiar<00:03:04.160> with

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
know if everyone's really familiar with

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.280 
know if everyone's really familiar with
what<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> lymphatic<00:03:05.420> system<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.990> mean<00:03:06.140> I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
what the lymphatic system is I mean I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.080 
what the lymphatic system is I mean I
think<00:03:06.500> we've<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.800> felt<00:03:07.130> like<00:03:07.400> Oh<00:03:07.550> lymph<00:03:07.850> nodes

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
think we've all felt like Oh lymph nodes

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.880 
think we've all felt like Oh lymph nodes
can<00:03:08.360> be<00:03:08.420> swollen<00:03:08.810> from<00:03:09.110> time<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.470> time<00:03:09.500> that's

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
can be swollen from time to time that's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.230 
can be swollen from time to time that's
what<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.310> right<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:10.790> when<00:03:11.090> it's

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
what that is right that's when it's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.050 
what that is right that's when it's
backed<00:03:11.450> up<00:03:11.720> okay<00:03:12.140> exactly<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.800> right<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
backed up okay exactly all right so the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.180 
backed up okay exactly all right so the
lens<00:03:14.270> system<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.870> basically<00:03:15.170> kind<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.160> a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
lens system is basically kind of like a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.970 
lens system is basically kind of like a
sewer<00:03:16.490> system<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.480> your<00:03:17.600> body<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.710> takes

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
sewer system for your body so it takes

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.910 
sewer system for your body so it takes
those<00:03:19.540> toxins<00:03:20.540> from<00:03:20.720> each<00:03:20.960> cells<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> it

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
those toxins from each cells and it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.680 
those toxins from each cells and it
brings<00:03:22.310> them<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.760> bloodstream<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.510> from

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
brings them to the bloodstream and from

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.420 
brings them to the bloodstream and from
the<00:03:23.810> bloodstream<00:03:24.080> where<00:03:24.500> you're<00:03:24.710> going<00:03:25.130> is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the bloodstream where you're going is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.340 
the bloodstream where you're going is
there<00:03:26.090> going<00:03:26.330> through<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.840> liver<00:03:27.050> and<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
there going through the liver and the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.800 
there going through the liver and the
kidneys<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.160> deliver<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> kidneys<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.570> very

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
kidneys and deliver the kidneys are very

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.800 
kidneys and deliver the kidneys are very
important<00:03:30.380> because<00:03:30.530> they<00:03:30.920> are<00:03:31.390> detoxifier<00:03:32.390> so

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
important because they are detoxifier so

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.110 
important because they are detoxifier so
they<00:03:33.020> process<00:03:33.830> anything<00:03:34.160> that's<00:03:34.490> talk<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:35.000> it

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
they process anything that's talk to it

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.490 
they process anything that's talk to it
or<00:03:35.330> anything<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.690> needs<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.050> be<00:03:36.110> broken<00:03:36.290> down

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
or anything that needs to be broken down

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.240 
or anything that needs to be broken down
breaks<00:03:37.280> them<00:03:37.490> down<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.750> those<00:03:39.620> toxins<00:03:40.070> come

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
breaks them down and those toxins come

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.950 
breaks them down and those toxins come
out<00:03:40.370> through<00:03:40.580> your<00:03:40.610> urine<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> toilet

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
out through your urine and in the toilet

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.950 
out through your urine and in the toilet
so<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:43.370> lymphatic<00:03:43.760> system<00:03:44.300> really<00:03:44.510> important

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
so so lymphatic system really important

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.780 
so so lymphatic system really important
movement<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.560> important<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.610> get

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
movement really important to get

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.060 
movement really important to get
everything<00:03:47.540> through<00:03:48.080> your<00:03:48.380> main<00:03:48.530> filters

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
everything through your main filters

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.270 
everything through your main filters
which<00:03:49.400> are<00:03:49.580> your<00:03:50.300> liver<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.660> kidneys<00:03:51.440> exactly

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
which are your liver and kidneys exactly

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.200 
which are your liver and kidneys exactly
okay<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.090> brings<00:03:53.330> me<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> liver

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.540 

because<00:03:58.140> what<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.650> found<00:03:58.920> over<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.460> years

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
because what I have found over the years

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.920 
because what I have found over the years
of<00:04:00.210> detoxifying<00:04:01.430> people<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.270> will

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
of detoxifying people is that they will

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.690 
of detoxifying people is that they will
often<00:04:04.140> lose<00:04:04.440> weight<00:04:04.680> when<00:04:05.040> we<00:04:05.220> cleanse<00:04:05.460> their

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
often lose weight when we cleanse their

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.350 
often lose weight when we cleanse their
liver<00:04:05.930> okay<00:04:06.950> liver<00:04:07.950> cleanse<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:08.760> not<00:04:09.150> often

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
liver okay liver cleanse it's not often

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.559 
liver okay liver cleanse it's not often
talked<00:04:09.720> about
