celebration of Star Wars day I have
recreate<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.540> power<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.139> wish<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.530> all<00:00:10.559> had

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
recreate a power we wish we all had

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.720 
recreate a power we wish we all had
force<00:00:12.120> push<00:00:12.500> with<00:00:13.500> force<00:00:13.860> push<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.610> have

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
force push with force push all you have

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.060 
force push with force push all you have
to<00:00:14.849> do<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.299> simply<00:00:15.570> use<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> force<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.710> all<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to do is simply use the force and all of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.779 
to do is simply use the force and all of
your<00:00:17.190> troubles<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.789> blown<00:00:18.090> away<00:00:19.789> so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
your troubles will be blown away so

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
your troubles will be blown away so
let's<00:00:21.600> take<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> look<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> system

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
let's take a look to see how the system

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.970 
let's take a look to see how the system
works<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.310> guess<00:00:24.140> now<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> best<00:00:25.560> part<00:00:25.830> about

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
works I guess now the best part about

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
works I guess now the best part about
this<00:00:26.279> concept<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.060> fact<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.660> doesn't

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
this concept is the fact that it doesn't

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.800 
this concept is the fact that it doesn't
require<00:00:28.289> any<00:00:28.680> mini<00:00:28.980> chlorines<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> said<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
require any mini chlorines and said it

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560 
require any mini chlorines and said it
uses<00:00:31.109> command<00:00:31.470> blocks<00:00:31.730> now<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> whole<00:00:33.090> system

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
uses command blocks now the whole system

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690 
uses command blocks now the whole system
is<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:35.250> simple

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
is actually just two very simple

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
is actually just two very simple
concepts<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.660> together<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.260> create<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
concepts put together to create the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.190 
concepts put together to create the
effect<00:00:37.850> both<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.300> simple<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:40.050> they

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
effect both are really simple but they

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540 
effect both are really simple but they
may<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.950> different<00:00:41.340> than<00:00:41.460> what

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
may be a little bit different than what

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
may be a little bit different than what
you<00:00:41.610> might<00:00:41.879> expect<00:00:43.129> as<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> might

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
occurs is the fact that the system needs

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
occurs is the fact that the system needs

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
would look something like this as you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
would look something like this as you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
can see it targets the armorstand
