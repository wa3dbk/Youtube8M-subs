00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.740 
if you want to UM play local host you
just<00:02:47.990> replace<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:49.460> here<00:02:49.790> whatever<00:02:50.480> IP

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
just replace this right here whatever IP

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.200 
just replace this right here whatever IP
is<00:02:51.020> right<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.470> with<00:02:51.920> local<00:02:52.370> host<00:02:52.550> do<00:02:53.090> not

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
it won't work so just replace local host

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.730 
it won't work so just replace local host
nothing<00:02:58.400> more<00:02:58.880> nothing<00:02:59.300> less<00:02:59.650> just<00:03:00.650> that
