alright<00:00:05.370> let's<00:00:05.670> talk<00:00:05.910> about<00:00:06.090> one<00:00:06.689> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> most

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
alright let's talk about one of the most

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.610 
alright let's talk about one of the most
important<00:00:08.400> aspects<00:00:08.879> of<00:00:09.000> nutrition<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:10.290> your

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
important aspects of nutrition for your

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.669 
important aspects of nutrition for your
health<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.370> keeping<00:00:12.030> inflammation<00:00:12.660> down<00:00:12.870> for

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
health for keeping inflammation down for

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919 
health for keeping inflammation down for
feeling<00:00:14.099> great<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.759> trying<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.389> keep<00:00:15.540> chronic

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
feeling great for trying to keep chronic

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.710 
feeling great for trying to keep chronic
diseases<00:00:16.259> away<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:18.119> now<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.330> need<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
diseases away and I think now we need to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.170 
diseases away and I think now we need to
stop<00:00:18.960> focusing<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:20.070> gluten-free<00:00:20.640> eating

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
stop focusing just on gluten-free eating

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
stop focusing just on gluten-free eating
and<00:00:21.390> focus<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.470> know<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.770> grains<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and focus on you know what grains do in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.519 
and focus on you know what grains do in
general<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.149> the<00:00:24.180> body<00:00:24.450> as<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.050> larger<00:00:25.500> group

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
general to the body as a larger group

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
general to the body as a larger group
and<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.489> we<00:00:26.579> say<00:00:26.759> grains<00:00:27.119> we're<00:00:27.390> talking

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and when we say grains we're talking

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.639 
and when we say grains we're talking
about<00:00:27.809> rice<00:00:28.430> potatoes<00:00:29.430> corn<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.649> also

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
about rice potatoes corn and also

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.560 
about rice potatoes corn and also
anything<00:00:32.309> made<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.489> flour<00:00:32.820> particularly

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
anything made with flour particularly

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.819 
anything made with flour particularly
wheat<00:00:33.750> flour<00:00:33.989> but<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.559> gluten-free

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
wheat flour but all these gluten-free

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
wheat flour but all these gluten-free
flours<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.610> seeing<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:37.140> two

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
flours we're seeing now so there's two

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.020 
flours we're seeing now so there's two
aspects<00:00:37.830> of<00:00:37.920> brains<00:00:38.220> that<00:00:38.400> we<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.640> worries

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
aspects of brains that we have worries

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.780 
aspects of brains that we have worries
about<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> first<00:00:39.810> is<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.350> inflammation<00:00:41.250> issue

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
about the first is an inflammation issue

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.860 
about the first is an inflammation issue
an<00:00:42.090> immune<00:00:42.480> issue<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:43.220> these<00:00:44.220> grains

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
an immune issue as these grains

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.570 
an immune issue as these grains
particularly<00:00:45.870> gluten<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.560> case<00:00:46.830> come

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
particularly gluten in this case come

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.420 
particularly gluten in this case come
through<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> digestive<00:00:48.090> system<00:00:48.420> largely

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
through the digestive system largely

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.800 
through the digestive system largely
undigested<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> potential<00:00:51.660> for

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
undigested they have the potential for

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.020 
undigested they have the potential for
irritating<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.590> immune<00:00:52.829> system<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.850> why

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
irritating the immune system that's why

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
irritating the immune system that's why
it's<00:00:54.210> linked<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.630> inflammatory<00:00:55.290> diseases

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it's linked to inflammatory diseases

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
it's linked to inflammatory diseases
like<00:00:56.430> autoimmune<00:00:56.790> disease<00:00:57.620> rashes<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.650> also

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
like autoimmune disease rashes but also

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360 
like autoimmune disease rashes but also
infertility<00:00:59.760> behavioral<00:01:00.660> concerns<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
infertility behavioral concerns so as

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
infertility behavioral concerns so as
people<00:01:02.790> are<00:01:03.000> starting<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.390> understand<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
people are starting to understand that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710 
people are starting to understand that
take<00:01:04.619> weed<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.220> their<00:01:05.399> diet<00:01:05.579> most<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.600> them

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
take weed out of their diet most of them

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
take weed out of their diet most of them
are<00:01:06.810> switching<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> gluten-free<00:01:07.650> products

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
are switching to gluten-free products

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.450 
are switching to gluten-free products
again<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.600> grains<00:01:10.220> heavily<00:01:11.220> processed

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
again more grains heavily processed

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840 
again more grains heavily processed
grains<00:01:11.900> now<00:01:12.900> we're<00:01:13.110> seeing<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.920> hormonal

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
grains now we're seeing in a hormonal

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
grains now we're seeing in a hormonal
issue<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.020> insulin<00:01:16.560> rise<00:01:16.800> when<00:01:17.310> we

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
issue we see insulin rise when we

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.750 
issue we see insulin rise when we
consume<00:01:17.820> any<00:01:18.120> grains<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.280> grains<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.520> eat

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
consume any grains because grains we eat

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120 
consume any grains because grains we eat
are<00:01:21.030> largely<00:01:21.390> processed<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.979> eat

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
are largely processed when you eat

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.940 
are largely processed when you eat
processed<00:01:23.400> food<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.600> body<00:01:24.840> does<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
processed food your body does little

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
processed food your body does little
work<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.340> digestion<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> glucose<00:01:27.720> or

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
work in digestion and so the glucose or

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
work in digestion and so the glucose or
the<00:01:28.049> sugar<00:01:28.290> level<00:01:28.680> carbohydrate<00:01:29.640> level<00:01:29.940> in

the sugar level carbohydrate level in

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.450 
the sugar level carbohydrate level in
the<00:01:30.060> blood<00:01:30.150> stream<00:01:30.299> Rises<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.140> quickly

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the blood stream Rises very quickly

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
the blood stream Rises very quickly
insulin<00:01:32.460> comes<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:32.880> quickly<00:01:33.409> insulin<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
insulin comes up very quickly insulin is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500 
insulin comes up very quickly insulin is
a<00:01:34.560> hormone<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:35.159> driving<00:01:35.729> fat<00:01:36.000> storage

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
a hormone that's driving fat storage

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.930 
a hormone that's driving fat storage
driving<00:01:37.440> you<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.770> sedentary<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
driving you to be sedentary so that you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.149 
driving you to be sedentary so that you
don't<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.600> exert<00:01:40.229> yourself<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:40.979> want

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
don't over exert yourself you don't want

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
don't over exert yourself you don't want
to<00:01:41.220> burn<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> energy<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.150> trying<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to burn up the energy you're trying to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
to burn up the energy you're trying to
store<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.619> drives<00:01:44.010> cravings<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
store it and also drives cravings if you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
store it and also drives cravings if you
can<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.570> carbs<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.650> more<00:01:46.890> glucose<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
can get more carbs get more glucose in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.520 
can get more carbs get more glucose in
your<00:01:47.610> system<00:01:48.000> makes<00:01:48.540> insulin<00:01:48.840> happy<00:01:49.350> because

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
your system makes insulin happy because

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
your system makes insulin happy because
again<00:01:49.770> insulin<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> storage<00:01:50.700> hormone<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
again insulin as a storage hormone so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
again insulin as a storage hormone so
when<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.260> eliminate<00:01:52.590> gluten<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> go

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
when you eliminate gluten and you go

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
when you eliminate gluten and you go
toward<00:01:53.970> gluten-free<00:01:54.360> products<00:01:55.430> yes<00:01:56.430> you've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
toward gluten-free products yes you've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789 
toward gluten-free products yes you've
taken<00:01:56.939> care<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.930> immune<00:01:58.260> side<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> the

taken care of the immune side of the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.429 
taken care of the immune side of the
equation<00:01:59.420> but<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.840> may<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.259> actually

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
equation but you may have actually

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
equation but you may have actually
worsened<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> hormonal<00:02:02.670> side<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.090> the
