identical which is very very easy for
pitching<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:52.899> then<00:00:53.110> we<00:00:53.380> simply<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.950> to

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
pitching and then we simply have to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.250 
pitching and then we simply have to
support<00:00:54.730> poles<00:00:55.000> on<00:00:55.360> either<00:00:55.570> side<00:00:55.840> of<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.050> tent

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
support poles on either side of the tent

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.740 
support poles on either side of the tent
as<00:00:56.410> well<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:58.180> features<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.719> outside

as well some features on the outside
here<00:00:59.260> we<00:00:59.770> can<00:00:59.950> see<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.460> we<00:01:00.820> have<00:01:01.030> these<00:01:01.270> vent

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
here we can see that we have these vent

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.160 
here we can see that we have these vent
view<00:01:02.200> windows<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.689> what<00:01:04.689> that<00:01:04.809> enables<00:01:04.960> you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
view windows and what that enables you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.050 
view windows and what that enables you
to<00:01:05.199> do<00:01:05.439> is<00:01:05.710> completely<00:01:06.340> open<00:01:06.549> up<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.759> windows

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
to do is completely open up the windows

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.109 
to do is completely open up the windows
on<00:01:07.569> the<00:01:07.780> outside<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.439> this<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.490> be<00:01:09.639> rolled<00:01:09.999> up

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
on the outside and this can be rolled up

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.199 
on the outside and this can be rolled up
and<00:01:10.179> stored<00:01:10.450> at<00:01:11.319> the<00:01:11.409> top<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.090> then

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
and stored at the top and then

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:14.730 
and stored at the top and then
underneath<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.990> can<00:01:14.139> see<00:01:14.289> that<00:01:14.439> there<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.709> a
