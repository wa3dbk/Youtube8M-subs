premier<00:00:02.610> today<00:00:02.970> we're<00:00:03.330> actually<00:00:03.419> coming<00:00:03.659> in

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
premier today we're actually coming in

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.079 
premier today we're actually coming in
with<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> mod<00:00:04.319> spotlight<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.190> know<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.850> not<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
with a mod spotlight I know it's not the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.730 
with a mod spotlight I know it's not the
thruster<00:00:06.480> one<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.660> love<00:00:06.899> thruster<00:00:07.290> ones<00:00:07.470> there

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
thruster one I love thruster ones there

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.960 
thruster one I love thruster ones there
is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:08.340> awesome

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
is a it's so awesome

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.180 
is a it's so awesome
so<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.809> warp<00:00:10.530> drive<00:00:11.240> v3<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:13.469> looks

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
so this is warp drive v3 and it looks

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.890 
so this is warp drive v3 and it looks
like<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> warp<00:00:14.700> drive<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.030> me<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.690> is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
like a warp drive to me this is

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.439 
like a warp drive to me this is
apparently<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.410> Star<00:00:17.010> Trek<00:00:17.039> inspired<00:00:17.699> creation

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
apparently a Star Trek inspired creation

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.560 
apparently a Star Trek inspired creation
and<00:00:19.039> it<00:00:20.039> goes<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.520> small<00:00:20.730> ships<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> big<00:00:21.300> ships

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and it goes on small ships and big ships

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.150 
and it goes on small ships and big ships
but<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.289> put<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> station<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
but I just put on the station here just

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.060 
but I just put on the station here just
for<00:00:23.279> show<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> dimensions<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.230> 3<00:00:25.529> by<00:00:25.650> 2<00:00:25.710> by<00:00:26.010> 7

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
for show the dimensions are 3 by 2 by 7

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.839 
for show the dimensions are 3 by 2 by 7
I<00:00:26.519> think

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I think

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.370 
I think
I<00:00:26.939> don't<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.180> much<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.630> sure<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.349> know

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I don't know much you're sure you know

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370 
I don't know much you're sure you know
what<00:00:28.560> let's<00:00:28.680> count<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.010> off<00:00:29.160> 1<00:00:29.460> 2<00:00:29.490> 3<00:00:29.970> 4<00:00:30.330> 5<00:00:30.630> 6<00:00:31.050> 7

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
what let's count them off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.150 
what let's count them off 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
maybe<00:00:32.340> 8<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> no<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> 10<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.530> by

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
maybe 8 is it no it's 10 I was right by

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
maybe 8 is it no it's 10 I was right by
2<00:00:35.219> by<00:00:35.399> 7<00:00:35.460> cool<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.870> let's<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.290> ahead<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.440> clear

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
2 by 7 cool so let's go ahead and clear

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.740 
2 by 7 cool so let's go ahead and clear
on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> ship<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.460> don't<00:00:38.879> ship<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.329> but

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on the ship I don't ship up there but

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
on the ship I don't ship up there but
we'll<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.020> today<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.680> minute<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.960> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we'll get today in a minute here so this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.139 
we'll get today in a minute here so this
is<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> size<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> know<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.969> even

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
is the size of it I know it's not even

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
is the size of it I know it's not even
that<00:00:45.239> big<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:46.050> course<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.559> backwards<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that big of course it's on backwards but

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.959 
that big of course it's on backwards but
the<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.300> small<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:49.039> amazing<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the pretty small they're amazing so I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.700 
the pretty small they're amazing so I
just<00:00:51.629> hit<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.930> our<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.199> Star<00:00:52.530> Wars

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
just hit up our little Star Wars

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130 
just hit up our little Star Wars
fighters<00:00:52.949> multiple<00:00:53.430> colors<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.480> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
fighters multiple colors over here it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
fighters multiple colors over here it's
sort<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> looks<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:55.860> bow<00:00:56.039> jqd<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.820> i

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
sort of the looks a little bow jqd but i

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.069 
sort of the looks a little bow jqd but i
just<00:00:57.059> need<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> add<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.600> power<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just need to add more power in the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.830 
just need to add more power in the
middle<00:00:58.320> section<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.070> some<00:00:59.840> reverse

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
middle section there and some reverse

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
middle section there and some reverse
thrusters<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.010> four<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.280> these<00:01:02.460> warp

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thrusters so we have four of these warp

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
thrusters so we have four of these warp
drives<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> connect<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> ship<00:01:03.960> well<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
drives to connect it to the ship well do

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
drives to connect it to the ship well do
this<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.549> jump<00:01:06.540> ring<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.930> whatever<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.229> call

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this some jump ring or whatever you call

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
this some jump ring or whatever you call
it<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.400> jump<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> kiss

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it so it's gonna jump in here and kiss

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
it so it's gonna jump in here and kiss
now<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.260> engines<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.010> everything's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
now so engines are on everything's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
now so engines are on everything's
active<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.270> reverse<00:01:12.510> thrust<00:01:12.780> which

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
active you can see reverse thrust which

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
active you can see reverse thrust which
is<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.229> fine<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:14.250> watch<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> speed<00:01:14.760> go

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
is just fine let's watch the speed go

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.740 
is just fine let's watch the speed go
here<00:01:15.180> three<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.259> one

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800 

Wow<00:01:19.800> we<00:01:20.160> met<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.520> reached<00:01:20.730> maximum<00:01:21.180> speed<00:01:21.660> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Wow we met we reached maximum speed that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
Wow we met we reached maximum speed that
quickly<00:01:22.230> that's<00:01:23.160> insanely<00:01:23.670> fast<00:01:25.400> now<00:01:26.400> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
quickly that's insanely fast now it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
quickly that's insanely fast now it
actually<00:01:26.820> works<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> jump<00:01:27.990> ring<00:01:28.140> pretty

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
actually works as a jump ring pretty

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
actually works as a jump ring pretty
much<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.940> brawl<00:01:30.180> speed<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.660> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
much because the brawl speed of the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
much because the brawl speed of the
stick<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> were<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.400> disconnect<00:01:32.850> from

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
stick so if we were to disconnect from

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.590 
stick so if we were to disconnect from
this<00:01:33.560> let's<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.680> indistinct<00:01:34.800> now<00:01:35.480> so<00:01:36.480> I<00:01:36.540> feel

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
this let's go indistinct now so I feel

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.350 
this let's go indistinct now so I feel
the<00:01:36.750> constant<00:01:37.050> dinging<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.620> my<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.360> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the constant dinging it's on my side so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.000 
the constant dinging it's on my side so
let's<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.400> ship<00:01:41.400> internal<00:01:42.000> pump<00:01:43.010> now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
let's go to the ship internal pump now

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.670 
let's go to the ship internal pump now
we<00:01:44.070> are<00:01:44.280> free<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.550> leave<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.450> ring<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:46.440> we're

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
