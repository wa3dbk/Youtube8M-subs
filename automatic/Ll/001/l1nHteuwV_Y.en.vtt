00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
was 14 pounds delivered and it's one of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.950 
was 14 pounds delivered and it's one of
the<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.079> old<00:00:50.000> 3<00:00:51.000> sixties<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the really old 3 sixties with one of the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.910 
the really old 3 sixties with one of the
earlier<00:00:52.559> ones<00:00:52.680> without<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.040> HDMI<00:00:53.700> and<00:00:54.920> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
earlier ones without the HDMI and I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.869 
earlier ones without the HDMI and I
basically<00:00:56.879> bought<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> whole

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
basically bought this just for the whole

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
basically bought this just for the whole
idea<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> getting<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.110> working<00:01:01.230> again<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
idea of getting it working again and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.040 
idea of getting it working again and
then<00:01:01.920> reselling<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.610> I'm<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
then reselling it I'm also kind of

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.210 
then reselling it I'm also kind of
hoping<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.770> probably<00:01:05.009> gonna<00:01:05.100> be

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hoping I know it's probably gonna be

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
hoping I know it's probably gonna be
really<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.180> slim<00:01:06.420> chance<00:01:06.720> but

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
really a really really slim chance but

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.889 
really a really really slim chance but
I'm<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.229> hoping<00:01:07.410> that<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.800> is<00:01:07.979> maybe<00:01:08.190> a

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
I'm really hoping that this is maybe a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.370 
I'm really hoping that this is maybe a
JTAG<00:01:09.899> hackable<00:01:10.709> console<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.259> it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
JTAG hackable console just because it's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
JTAG hackable console just because it's
so<00:01:13.500> old<00:01:13.679> I'm<00:01:13.979> hoping<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.819> it's<00:01:14.940> been<00:01:15.090> sitting

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so old I'm hoping that it's been sitting

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
so old I'm hoping that it's been sitting
in<00:01:15.479> someone's<00:01:15.780> cupboard<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.440> couple<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
in someone's cupboard for a couple of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.330 
in someone's cupboard for a couple of
years<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.830> been<00:01:19.830> updated

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
years and it's not really been updated

years and it's not really been updated
if<00:01:20.849> any<00:01:21.149> kind<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> new<00:01:21.630> firmware<00:01:21.959> or<00:01:22.259> whatnot

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
if any kind of new firmware or whatnot

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.520

up<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.129> see<00:02:27.760> what<00:02:27.790> error<00:02:28.000> code<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.510> I'm

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
up and see what error code we get I'm

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.960 
up and see what error code we get I'm
guessing<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.739> going<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> be<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> standard

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
guessing just going to be a standard

I'm straight away we've got three red
lights<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.360> death<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> next<00:02:38.530> time<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.739> can

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
lights of death so the next time I can

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.550 
lights of death so the next time I can
try<00:02:39.129> is<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.730> secondary<00:02:40.480> error<00:02:40.720> code<00:02:40.989> the

the console what you can do is look at
the<00:02:48.900> secondary<00:02:49.900> error<00:02:50.140> code<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.590> will

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the secondary error code and that will

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.309 
the secondary error code and that will
give<00:02:50.859> us<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:51.220> kind<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.579> specific<00:02:52.319> error

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
code and tell us maybe I'll do more

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.580 
code and tell us maybe I'll do more
about<00:02:55.599> what's<00:02:55.840> actually<00:02:55.989> wrong<00:02:56.319> with<00:02:56.470> the

sank button and press the eject button
and<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:02.230> will<00:03:02.319> flash<00:03:03.060> different<00:03:04.060> weights<00:03:04.209> here

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
and it will flash different weights here

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.869 
and it will flash different weights here
and<00:03:04.780> give<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> secondary<00:03:05.530> record<00:03:05.879> so

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
and give you the secondary record so

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.360 
and give you the secondary record so
just<00:03:07.090> put<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.209> camera<00:03:07.480> down<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
just put the camera down to do this so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.009 
just put the camera down to do this so
hold<00:03:09.579> down<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> sync<00:03:10.000> button<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.659> press<00:03:10.870> the

hold down the sync button and press the
eject<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:12.280> that's<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.519> first<00:03:12.730> number<00:03:13.060> there

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
eject so that's the first number there

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.280 
eject so that's the first number there
that's<00:03:13.510> zero<00:03:14.010> put<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.129> again<00:03:15.370> another<00:03:15.640> zero<00:03:16.290> is

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
that's zero put it again another zero is

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.830 
that's zero put it again another zero is
again<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.650> equals<00:03:17.980> two<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:19.810> another

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
again that equals two and then another

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.280 
again that equals two and then another
zero<00:03:20.379> so<00:03:20.680> zero<00:03:20.859> zero<00:03:21.370> two<00:03:21.579> zero<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.750> next<00:03:23.139> thing

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
zero so zero zero two zero so next thing

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.099 
zero so zero zero two zero so next thing
you<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:24.239> check<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.299> on<00:03:25.630> light<00:03:25.840> and

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
you can do is check that on light and

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.089 
you can do is check that on light and

ourself if you want so you get secondary
error<00:03:33.849> codes<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.650> we're<00:03:35.650> looking<00:03:35.859> for<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> zero

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
error codes and we're looking for a zero

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.039 
error codes and we're looking for a zero
zero<00:03:36.579> two<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.720> scroll<00:03:37.959> down<00:03:39.810> zero<00:03:40.810> zero

zero two so just scroll down zero zero

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.449 
zero two so just scroll down zero zero
two<00:03:41.230> zero<00:03:41.560> should<00:03:41.889> say<00:03:44.160> mmm

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.360 

we<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.120> through

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.260 

yes<00:03:52.970> there<00:03:53.180> we<00:03:53.239> go

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.700 

there<00:03:57.270> we<00:03:57.360> go<00:03:57.590> see<00:03:58.590> error<00:03:58.890> e<00:03:59.330> o8<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:01.320> what<00:04:01.500> does

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
there we go see error e o8 so what does

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:14.050 
there we go see error e o8 so what does
just<00:04:02.160> scroll<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.510> see<00:04:03.690> what<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.900> means

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.470 

you<00:04:14.540> see<00:04:14.750> there's<00:04:14.930> quite<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.140> few<00:04:16.090> error<00:04:17.090> codes

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
you see there's quite a few error codes

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.870 
you see there's quite a few error codes
here<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.859> error<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.430> there

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
here so error it there

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.840 
here so error it there
that's<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.870> unconfirmed<00:04:21.739> general<00:04:22.280> aisle

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
that's a unconfirmed general aisle

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.480 
that's a unconfirmed general aisle
malfunction<00:04:23.660> it<00:04:24.530> could<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.830> caused<00:04:25.100> with

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
malfunction it could be caused with

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.870 
malfunction it could be caused with
there<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.990> aisle<00:04:27.320> devices<00:04:28.100> such<00:04:28.280> as<00:04:28.310> AV

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
there and the aisle devices such as AV

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.870 
there and the aisle devices such as AV
port<00:04:29.150> USB<00:04:29.410> etc<00:04:30.410> etc<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:33.280> now<00:04:34.280> we're<00:04:34.430> getting<00:04:34.820> a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
port USB etc etc so now we're getting a

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.100 
port USB etc etc so now we're getting a
better<00:04:35.060> idea<00:04:35.270> of<00:04:35.450> what's<00:04:35.660> actually<00:04:35.780> wrong

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
better idea of what's actually wrong

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.720 
better idea of what's actually wrong
with<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.620> console<00:04:37.070> I'm<00:04:37.250> going<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.490> take<00:04:37.640> the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
with the console I'm going to take the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.270 
with the console I'm going to take the
thing<00:04:37.910> apart<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.680> see<00:04:39.680> if<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.830> can<00:04:39.980> actually

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
thing apart and see if I can actually

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.490 
thing apart and see if I can actually
see<00:04:40.460> anything<00:04:40.730> obviously<00:04:41.390> wrong<00:04:41.810> with<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.200> if

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
see anything obviously wrong with it if

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.700 
see anything obviously wrong with it if
there's<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:42.890> all<00:04:43.040> this<00:04:43.160> cable<00:04:43.580> somewhere<00:04:43.970> or

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
there's like all this cable somewhere or

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.659 
there's like all this cable somewhere or
and<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.950> other<00:04:46.100> thing<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.370> where<00:04:46.520> all<00:04:46.580> this

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
and the other thing is where all this

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.130 
and the other thing is where all this
has<00:04:46.880> been<00:04:47.030> opened<00:04:47.330> before<00:04:47.419> by<00:04:47.690> someone<00:04:47.990> else

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
has been opened before by someone else

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.900 
has been opened before by someone else
so<00:04:48.380> I'll<00:04:48.950> see<00:04:49.160> if<00:04:49.250> they've<00:04:49.400> maybe<00:04:49.550> done<00:04:49.760> any

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
so I'll see if they've maybe done any

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.540 
so I'll see if they've maybe done any
damage<00:04:50.150> or<00:04:50.480> anything<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.550> that'd

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
damage or anything like that so that'd

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.180 
damage or anything like that so that'd
be<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.820> for<00:04:53.030> this<00:04:53.150> part<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.630> video<00:04:53.750> and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
I'll make another video when actually

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.990
