00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.559
 when we go on vacation we should 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.150
 worry about the memory of our 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.610
 house during the time that we will be 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 out thanks to technology solutions 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.440
 that will be restricted today to be at 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.660
 reach of all 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.820
 in any security system what 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
 essential is a sensor that in the piece 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.410
 responsible for detecting the presence of 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.450
 strange the infrared are capable of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.009
 Read the temperature of the objects by 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.369
 what will be activated just a new 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.590
 element enter in your visual field the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.629
 most common are the magnetic ones 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.760
 they use on doors and windows and they 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.140
 activate when the connection between 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.870
 they 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.730
 there are also carpet sensors that 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 activate with the pressure of the steps of 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.399
 a person 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.780
 after the detection of a situation 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.789
 irregular 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 the sensor will notify the system through the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 cable that connects them or through a 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 wireless connection the latter with a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510
 reach up to 30 meters 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.269
 after the alert the system must 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 activate an alarm can be silent 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.560
 issuing a message or call to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
 mobile phone or rectifies that the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 user determines or thanks to a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.340
 exclusive sim card of the team that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 grants independence before any 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 general failure 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 Of course you can also activate 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.140
 a siren like this led light and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
 powerful speaker 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 something fundamental in security in the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 surveillance where in addition to the cameras 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.830
 The fate of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.740
 images 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.600
 This set includes a dvr to manage and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.730
 store videos thanks to a hard drive 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.770
 the internal ones that can be recorded in 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.650
 continuous form or by activation 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.360
 of a motion sensor is accessed in 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.310
 remotely and real time from 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 anywhere in the world through 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 a tablet or pc smartphone 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 the four ip cameras of this that we 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 they allow us to monitor our house in 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.000
 four channels simultaneously from the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.310
 notebook captures quality images 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.079
 digital the two cameras that are installed 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.939
 inside the house they consider 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.920
 audio and your night vision for 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.920
 Outside reaches 200 meters
