having played around with all the
upgrades<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> car<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.340> do

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
upgrades on the car I think you do

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.070 
upgrades on the car I think you do
actually<00:03:24.610> get<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.970> best<00:03:25.150> out<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.630> by

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually get the best out of it by

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.350 
actually get the best out of it by
upgrading<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.680> all<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.920> way<00:03:27.070> initially<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
upgrading it all the way initially I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.850 
upgrading it all the way initially I
thought<00:03:28.720> by<00:03:28.870> upgrading<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.380> engine<00:03:29.650> you'll

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
thought by upgrading the engine you'll

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.460 
thought by upgrading the engine you'll
make<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.190> slightly<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.580> difficult<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.180> drive

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
make it slightly more difficult to drive

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.199 
make it slightly more difficult to drive
you<00:03:32.470> can<00:03:32.680> counter<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.250> by<00:03:33.459> improving<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
you can counter this by improving the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.270 
you can counter this by improving the
handling<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.690> stay<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.930> three<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.739> by<00:03:36.040> better

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
handling to stay to three and by better

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920 
handling to stay to three and by better
distributing<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> extra<00:03:37.450> power<00:03:37.660> with<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930

like<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.720> upgrade<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.229> gutters<00:04:26.560> handling<00:04:26.919> to

like to upgrade the gutters handling to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070 
like to upgrade the gutters handling to
tier<00:04:27.280> 2<00:04:27.520> which<00:04:27.910> improves<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.510> brakes<00:04:28.810> and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
tier 2 which improves the brakes and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.230 
tier 2 which improves the brakes and
lowers<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.500> suspension<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.790> allows<00:04:31.030> me<00:04:31.210> to

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
lowers the suspension this allows me to

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.030 
lowers the suspension this allows me to
brake<00:04:31.540> later<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.229> take<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.530> corn<00:04:32.770> as<00:04:32.890> much

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
brake later and take the corn as much

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.640 
brake later and take the corn as much
faster<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.720> benefit<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.140> upgrading<00:04:35.560> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
faster the benefit of upgrading the

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
improvement in power and acceleration

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.080 
improvement in power and acceleration
which<00:04:40.510> is<00:04:40.660> always<00:04:40.840> nice<00:04:41.080> as<00:04:41.320> well<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:42.090> tried

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
which is always nice as well I tried

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.640 
which is always nice as well I tried
upgrading<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.630> transmission<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:44.440> car

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
upgrading the transmission on this car

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.020 
upgrading the transmission on this car
too<00:04:44.890> which<00:04:45.070> improved<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.520> top<00:04:45.729> speed

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
too which improved the top speed

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.150 
too which improved the top speed
significantly<00:04:46.720> or<00:04:47.169> found<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.680> affected<00:04:48.130> the

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
significantly or found and affected the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.550 
significantly or found and affected the
acceleration<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.210> neck

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
acceleration and the neck

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.070 
acceleration and the neck
away<00:04:49.860> from<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.250> lower-end<00:04:50.700> gears<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.330> think

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
away from the lower-end gears I think

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.540 
away from the lower-end gears I think
it's<00:04:52.260> much<00:04:52.380> more<00:04:52.440> important<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.130> have<00:04:53.280> better

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
it's much more important to have better

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.580 
it's much more important to have better
acceleration<00:04:53.910> on<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.419> exit<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:54.900> corner<00:04:55.260> then

acceleration on the exit of corner then

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.170 
acceleration on the exit of corner then
is<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.889> have<00:04:55.980> an<00:04:56.100> extra<00:04:56.340> 10<00:04:56.520> mile<00:04:56.700> an<00:04:56.730> hour<00:04:56.910> top

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
is to have an extra 10 mile an hour top

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.330 
is to have an extra 10 mile an hour top
speed<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.720> decided<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.590> remove<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.100> next

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340

I<00:05:23.010> wrap<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.490> which<00:05:23.729> want<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:23.970> briefly

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
I wrap this up which want to briefly

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.600 
I wrap this up which want to briefly
mention<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.690> Koenigsegg<00:05:25.200> Agera<00:05:25.229> R<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:26.430> has<00:05:26.550> a

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
mention the Koenigsegg Agera R it has a

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.940 
mention the Koenigsegg Agera R it has a
greater<00:05:26.970> top<00:05:27.300> speed<00:05:27.630> more<00:05:28.169> power<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.919> a

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
greater top speed more power and is a

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.650 
greater top speed more power and is a
lot<00:05:29.190> lighter<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.700> mean<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.060> also<00:05:30.210> accelerates

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
lot lighter I mean it also accelerates

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.440 
lot lighter I mean it also accelerates
better<00:05:31.139> than<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.470> Veyron<00:05:32.030> does<00:05:33.030> this<00:05:33.180> means

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
better than the Veyron does this means

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.969 
better than the Veyron does this means
head<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.870> shoulders<00:05:34.169> above<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.500> Veyron<00:05:34.830> and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
a much better car to use it doesn't this

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.920 
a much better car to use it doesn't this
