 hello everyone today we'll chat 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.910
 and here are double blush or 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.900
 rouge and browser 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 from company format shades in 116 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.559
 so here in the elite until the video on 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 most ordinary 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.289
 these blush let's say they are so famous 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.080
 like a shade of 115 but i want you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.750
 tell first is more shades 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 such are exactly suitable for all why 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 because father is such a natural 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 pink blush and very much like that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.469
 tender I would say not even at all 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 bronze and probably also more natka 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.930
 either blush or the same corrector 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.270
 shades are perfect for girls 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 fair skin i mean they don't really say 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 such capricious things like that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.399
 they are very similar to the elf us us if 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 honestly here is a phrase shades can 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
 a good look at them, they 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.989
 the truth is very very similar to them to take 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 you absolutely matte texture than 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.430
 the more you leave them layering the more 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 pigmented they will they be easy 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.170
 typing in a brush is very easy 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.540
 applied here so nice 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.880
 soft silky texture they are true 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 easy to stew and even a newbie that's true 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.670
 they can easily be applied quickly 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.560
 to distribute 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 And these your Dimka can be use 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.119
 true as the browser as blush and how 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.880
 proofreader meaning they are very even 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.950
 universally you don't go overboard with them and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 that the main thing they did not become any 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 matte texture color spots you 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.310
 you know that I love them very much because 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.770
 They are suitable for different skin types for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.020
 different ages for different machine tools 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.939
 cases of life because matte 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 the texture is more versatile 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.920
 that's how they look they are very easy 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 recruited easily extinguish them nicely 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.730
 selling to put them very precisely 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.010
 natural and it looks nice 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.170
 there is no pigment that say 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.360
 so will either put or cut out 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 Someone like that looks like this 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.890
 fresh and very like me as always 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.440

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.580

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.960

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.110
 shade honestly very 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.060
 I liked it because I basically 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.520
 pretty pale skin and such here 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.070
