00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.180 
find in the I guess a seasonal area and
it's<00:00:58.540> not<00:00:58.839> your<00:00:59.049> ordinary<00:00:59.229> burner<00:00:59.920> it's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
it's not your ordinary burner it's

connect to like one of those peanut oil

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.880 
connect to like one of those peanut oil
or<00:01:05.530> peanut<00:01:05.890> cookers<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:07.659> turkey<00:01:08.409> cooker<00:01:08.710> with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
or peanut cookers are turkey cooker with

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.520 
or peanut cookers are turkey cooker with
me<00:01:08.979> another<00:01:09.190> one<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:10.180> anyways<00:01:10.900> let<00:01:11.020> me<00:01:11.140> show

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
me another one so anyways let me show

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.930 
me another one so anyways let me show
you<00:01:11.590> what<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.130> got<00:01:12.220> here<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.200> a

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
you what I got here this is a

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.240 
you what I got here this is a
three-quarter<00:01:15.940> inch<00:01:16.230> black<00:01:17.230> iron<00:01:17.590> pipe<00:01:17.950> I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
three-quarter inch black iron pipe I

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.760 
three-quarter inch black iron pipe I
believe<00:01:18.820> that's<00:01:19.410> probably<00:01:20.410> about<00:01:20.530> maybe

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
believe that's probably about maybe

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.710 
believe that's probably about maybe
eight<00:01:21.100> inches<00:01:21.430> long<00:01:21.730> and<00:01:22.030> then<00:01:22.450> i<00:01:22.510> have<00:01:22.690> my

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
eight inches long and then i have my

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.590 
eight inches long and then i have my
reducer<00:01:23.320> fitting<00:01:23.650> here<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.940> reduces<00:01:25.240> it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
reducer fitting here and that reduces it

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
reducer fitting here and that reduces it
from<00:01:25.870> three<00:01:26.200> quarters<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:28.020> 383<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.260> nipple

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
from three quarters to 383 it's nipple

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.490 
from three quarters to 383 it's nipple
and<00:01:29.800> that's<00:01:30.370> about<00:01:30.550> two<00:01:30.880> inches<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.390> then<00:01:32.380> i

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
and that's about two inches and then i

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.680 
and that's about two inches and then i
got<00:01:32.760> 38<00:01:33.760> t<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:36.400> these<00:01:36.610> are<00:01:36.690> reducers

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
got 38 t and then these are reducers

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.090 
got 38 t and then these are reducers
these<00:01:38.650> are<00:01:38.800> three<00:01:39.460> eighths<00:01:39.730> to<00:01:40.090> corner<00:01:40.720> i<00:01:41.100> got

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
these are three eighths to corner i got

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.400 
these are three eighths to corner i got
two<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.400> those<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.900> for<00:01:44.050> my<00:01:44.200> air

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
two of those and this is for my air

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.440 
two of those and this is for my air
supply<00:01:44.680> line<00:01:45.130> because<00:01:45.430> i<00:01:45.490> hook<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:45.850> up<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.090> my

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
supply line because i hook this up to my

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.450 
supply line because i hook this up to my
compressor<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.740> i<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:49.390> adequately

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
compressor so that i can more adequately

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.100 
compressor so that i can more adequately
adjust<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.730> flow<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.360> air<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:52.960> going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
adjust the flow of air and it's going

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.170 
adjust the flow of air and it's going
into<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.650> so<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.280> quarter<00:01:54.670> inch<00:01:54.880> and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
into it so this is a quarter inch and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.899 
into it so this is a quarter inch and
then<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:55.990> course<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.320> quarter<00:01:56.620> inch<00:01:56.800> adapter<00:01:57.040> so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
then of course a quarter inch adapter so

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.430 
then of course a quarter inch adapter so
i<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.180> hook<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.450> up<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.570> my<00:01:58.659> air<00:01:58.900> supply<00:01:59.080> line

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
i can hook it up to my air supply line

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.680 
i can hook it up to my air supply line
then<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.610> natural<00:02:00.760> are<00:02:01.240> sorry<00:02:01.510> for<00:02:01.570> the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
then for the natural are sorry for the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.990 
then for the natural are sorry for the
pain<00:02:02.110> side<00:02:02.380> again<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.860> got<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.040> three-eighths<00:02:03.880> of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
pain side again I got a three-eighths of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.590 
pain side again I got a three-eighths of
an<00:02:04.120> inch<00:02:04.380> reducer<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.040> bushing<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
an inch reducer so this bushing so it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.499 
an inch reducer so this bushing so it
goes<00:02:07.750> from<00:02:07.870> 38<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:08.619> quarter<00:02:09.269> another<00:02:10.269> valve

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
goes from 38 to a quarter another valve

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.360 
goes from 38 to a quarter another valve
although<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> be<00:02:11.440> honest<00:02:11.739> with<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.040> could

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
although to be honest with you you could

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.240 
although to be honest with you you could
probably<00:02:12.610> take<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.269> valve<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:13.750> because<00:02:14.560> you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
probably take the valve out because you

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.959 
probably take the valve out because you
got<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> shut<00:02:15.730> off<00:02:15.760> valve<00:02:15.909> here<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.969> propane

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
got a shut off valve here in the propane

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.759 
got a shut off valve here in the propane
line<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.049> also<00:02:20.200> have<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
line and then you also have one on the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.170 
line and then you also have one on the
tank

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
tank

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330 
tank
so<00:02:21.329> this<00:02:21.989> might<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.409> little<00:02:22.530> overkill<00:02:22.739> it's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so this might be a little overkill it's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.970 
so this might be a little overkill it's
up<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.799> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
up to you and then this this is a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.880 
up to you and then this this is a
probably<00:02:26.730> about<00:02:26.819> five<00:02:27.180> inch<00:02:27.530> piece<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.709> brass

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
probably about five inch piece of brass

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.000 
probably about five inch piece of brass
pipe<00:02:29.280> quarter<00:02:29.849> inch<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.469> then<00:02:31.469> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.799> just

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
pipe quarter inch and then this is just

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.479 
pipe quarter inch and then this is just
a<00:02:32.099> male<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.609> female<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:34.650> sorry<00:02:35.069> male<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> male

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
a male to female or sorry male to male

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.649 
a male to female or sorry male to male
connector<00:02:35.939> and<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.950> by<00:02:38.250> another<00:02:39.180> bushing

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
connector and this is by another bushing

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.220 
connector and this is by another bushing
and<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.930> goes<00:02:40.139> from<00:02:40.639> 38<00:02:41.639> to<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:42.269> quarter<00:02:42.750> or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and this goes from 38 to a quarter or

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.500 
and this goes from 38 to a quarter or
sorry<00:02:43.549> three-eighths<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.849> an<00:02:44.969> eighth<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.389> an

sorry three-eighths to an eighth of an

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.940 
sorry three-eighths to an eighth of an
inch<00:02:45.650> because<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.280> line<00:02:48.180> itself<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:49.049> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
inch because the line itself on the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.550 
inch because the line itself on the
propane<00:02:50.459> regulator<00:02:50.849> that's<00:02:51.810> actually<00:02:52.079> only

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
propane regulator that's actually only

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.619 
propane regulator that's actually only
about<00:02:52.889> an<00:02:53.700> eighth<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.939> an<00:02:54.060> inch<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.299> there

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
about an eighth of an inch right there

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.780 
about an eighth of an inch right there
so<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.769> keep<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.159> mind<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.549> would

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
so just keep that in mind but I would

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.789 
so just keep that in mind but I would
double<00:02:57.120> check<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.599> when<00:02:58.230> you're<00:02:58.439> in<00:02:58.739> your

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
double check this when you're in your

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.699 
double check this when you're in your
test<00:02:59.280> fitting<00:02:59.669> your<00:02:59.819> stuff<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.590> don't<00:03:01.590> be

test fitting your stuff out don't be

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
afraid to go to lowes and actually start

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.229 
afraid to go to lowes and actually start
putting<00:03:04.409> all<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> together<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:05.609> again<00:03:06.209> I

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
putting all this together and again I

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.149 
putting all this together and again I
may<00:03:06.480> have<00:03:06.569> gone<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:06.900> overboard<00:03:07.620> here

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
may have gone a little overboard here

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.780 
may have gone a little overboard here
taping<00:03:08.819> everything<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:11.069> part<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.579> pipe

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
taping everything this part of the pipe

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.179 
taping everything this part of the pipe
gets<00:03:12.030> pretty<00:03:12.329> hot<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.780> here<00:03:12.919> but<00:03:13.919> by<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.099> time

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
gets pretty hot up here but by the time

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.069 
gets pretty hot up here but by the time
it<00:03:14.459> gets<00:03:14.549> down<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.239> not<00:03:15.659> really

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
it gets down to here it's not really

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.429 
it gets down to here it's not really
that<00:03:16.230> bad<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.169> just<00:03:19.169> feel<00:03:19.290> more

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
that bad so and I just feel more

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.530 
that bad so and I just feel more
comfortable<00:03:19.769> having<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.700> tape<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.510> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
comfortable having the tape on it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.819 
comfortable having the tape on it
because<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.959> don't<00:03:22.109> want<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.319> see<00:03:22.439> any<00:03:22.590> leaks

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
because I don't want to see any leaks

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.180 
because I don't want to see any leaks
anywhere<00:03:23.310> through<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.849> system<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.290> that's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
anywhere through the system so that's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.330 
anywhere through the system so that's
how<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.609> put<00:03:26.849> one<00:03:27.030> together<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.340> this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
how you can put one together and this

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.860 
how you can put one together and this
waters<00:03:29.729> seeing<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.269> action<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.750> can

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
waters seeing it in action you can

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.509 
waters seeing it in action you can
actually<00:03:31.139> look<00:03:31.229> at<00:03:31.379> one<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.590> my<00:03:31.739> previous<00:03:32.010> post

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
actually look at one of my previous post

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.580 
actually look at one of my previous post
for<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.940> ginger<00:03:33.120> tea<00:03:33.389> I'll<00:03:33.540> laid<00:03:33.840> stands<00:03:34.409> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
for the ginger tea I'll laid stands and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.219 
for the ginger tea I'll laid stands and
you<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:35.519> actually<00:03:35.669> see<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.180> use<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
you can actually see it in use and it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.599 
you can actually see it in use and it
works<00:03:37.409> pretty<00:03:37.560> well<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:38.099> be<00:03:38.189> honest<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
works pretty well to be honest with the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.729 
works pretty well to be honest with the
I've<00:03:38.760> only<00:03:39.060> had<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.870> thing<00:03:40.049> up<00:03:40.199> about<00:03:40.409> half

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
I've only had this thing up about half

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.830 
I've only had this thing up about half
way<00:03:41.069> because<00:03:41.669> my<00:03:41.849> propane<00:03:42.269> I'm<00:03:42.449> sorry<00:03:42.629> money

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
way because my propane I'm sorry money

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.949 
way because my propane I'm sorry money
on<00:03:43.310> compressor<00:03:44.310> will<00:03:44.669> only<00:03:44.909> put<00:03:45.239> out<00:03:45.389> probably

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
on compressor will only put out probably

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.939 
on compressor will only put out probably
about<00:03:46.400> 20<00:03:47.400> psi<00:03:47.840> once<00:03:48.840> once<00:03:49.260> I've<00:03:49.379> depleted<00:03:49.829> all

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
about 20 psi once once I've depleted all

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.129 
about 20 psi once once I've depleted all
the<00:03:50.069> pressure<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.549> system<00:03:50.909> so<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:52.049> know

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
the pressure in the system so you know

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.170 
the pressure in the system so you know
fully<00:03:52.620> running<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.159> will<00:03:53.250> only<00:03:53.370> put<00:03:53.639> out<00:03:53.790> 20

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
fully running it will only put out 20

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.569 
fully running it will only put out 20
psi<00:03:54.479> and<00:03:55.049> then<00:03:55.409> with<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:56.129> would<00:03:56.400> probably

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
psi and then with this I would probably

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.530 
psi and then with this I would probably
say<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:57.500> maybe<00:03:58.500> only<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.979> it<00:03:59.099> at<00:03:59.220> five<00:03:59.939> to<00:04:00.209> six

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
say I maybe only have it at five to six

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.009 
say I maybe only have it at five to six
psi<00:04:01.229> coming<00:04:01.979> out<00:04:02.159> so<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:03.389> know<00:04:03.509> it<00:04:03.810> works

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
psi coming out so you know it works

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.080 
psi coming out so you know it works
pretty<00:04:04.229> well<00:04:04.379> if<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.250> had<00:04:05.370> more<00:04:05.669> of<00:04:05.790> an<00:04:05.879> air

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
pretty well if I had more of an air

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.149 
pretty well if I had more of an air
supply<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.870> could<00:04:07.109> probably<00:04:07.349> kick<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.919> up<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
supply I could probably kick it up and

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.339 
supply I could probably kick it up and
go<00:04:08.280> even<00:04:08.579> even<00:04:09.090> hotter<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.569> faster<00:04:09.629> than<00:04:10.169> that

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
go even even hotter and faster than that

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.080 
go even even hotter and faster than that
