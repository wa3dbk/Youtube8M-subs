00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
for example this says a spring-loaded

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.179 
for example this says a spring-loaded
damper<00:01:23.960> right<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.439> okay<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> can

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
damper right in here okay here you can

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.469 
damper right in here okay here you can
see<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> damper<00:01:27.030> arm<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:29.060> allows<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> glove

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
see the damper arm that allows the glove

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.080 
see the damper arm that allows the glove
box<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.990> open<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.430> more<00:01:32.790> slowly

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
box to open a little bit more slowly

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
box to open a little bit more slowly
instead<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.840> flopping<00:01:34.170> open<00:01:34.880> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
instead of just flopping open to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.319 
instead of just flopping open to
disconnect<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:38.250> simply<00:01:41.000> pull<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> off

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
disconnect that you simply pull it off

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.370 
disconnect that you simply pull it off
the<00:01:42.570> pin<00:01:44.240> now<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> other<00:01:45.450> two<00:01:45.689> pivot<00:01:46.020> arms<00:01:46.290> are

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the pin now the other two pivot arms are

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.249 
the pin now the other two pivot arms are
pretty<00:01:46.619> hard<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.020> right

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
pretty hard to see this one is right

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.710 
pretty hard to see this one is right
back<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:50.299> when<00:01:51.299> my<00:01:51.479> finger<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> pointing

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
back in there when my finger is pointing

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.679 
back in there when my finger is pointing
and<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:55.200> another<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.040> side

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
and there's another one on this side

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.740 
and there's another one on this side
back<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.930> there<00:01:58.460> what<00:01:59.460> I'll<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> do<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
back in there what I'll have to do is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
back in there what I'll have to do is
pry<00:02:01.110> them<00:02:01.320> open<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.979> look<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.280> them

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
pry them open so you can look at them

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.890 
pry them open so you can look at them
trick<00:02:04.040> press<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.400> this<00:02:05.580> case<00:02:05.880> these<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.450> pivot

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
trick press in this case these two pivot

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.499 
trick press in this case these two pivot
these<00:02:07.260> two<00:02:07.470> sides<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.270> glove<00:02:09.270> box

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
these two sides of the glove box

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.980 
these two sides of the glove box
together<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.130> pull<00:02:11.430> down<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.510> box

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
together and then pull down on the box

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:25.220 
together and then pull down on the box
until<00:02:14.180> pivot<00:02:15.180> arms<00:02:15.800> clear<00:02:23.870> with<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> glove

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
until pivot arms clear with the glove

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.560 
until pivot arms clear with the glove
box<00:02:25.440> open<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.910> area<00:02:27.330> where

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
box open you can now see the area where

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.930 
box open you can now see the area where
the<00:02:27.600> cabin<00:02:28.590> filter<00:02:29.070> goes<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.640> black

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the cabin filter goes that black

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.840 
the cabin filter goes that black
rectangle<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.680> if<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.460> add<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> little

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
rectangle and if we add a little

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.750 
rectangle and if we add a little
flashlight<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.650> there<00:02:35.580> on

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
flashlight to it you can see there on

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.949 
flashlight to it you can see there on
the<00:02:35.880> left<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> clip<00:02:38.390> moving<00:02:39.390> over<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.840> the

the left is a clip moving over to the
right<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.560> another<00:02:40.860> flip<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:42.660> we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
right there's another flip so what we

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.320 
right there's another flip so what we
want<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.990> do<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.459> release<00:02:44.459> those<00:02:44.730> clips<00:02:45.090> by
