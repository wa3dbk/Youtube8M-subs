00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
after the original push more than two

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.160 
after the original push more than two
years<00:00:20.890> ago<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:22.180> hopes<00:00:22.539> that<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.900> game<00:00:23.050> would

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
years ago in hopes that the game would

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.240 
years ago in hopes that the game would
be<00:00:23.320> good<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:26.109> short<00:00:26.320> story<00:00:26.470> is<00:00:26.830> that<00:00:26.859> it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
be good and the short story is that it

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.910 
be good and the short story is that it
is<00:00:27.369> finally<00:00:27.939> what<00:00:28.420> I<00:00:28.480> would<00:00:28.689> consider<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:29.500> good

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
is finally what I would consider a good

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.670 
is finally what I would consider a good
game<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:30.730> I<00:00:31.599> want<00:00:31.960> to<00:00:32.080> give<00:00:32.200> you<00:00:32.290> guys<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
game and I want to give you guys the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.770 
game and I want to give you guys the
reasons<00:00:33.070> why<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.670> how<00:00:33.880> this<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.240> different

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
reasons why and how this is different

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.700 
reasons why and how this is different
and<00:00:34.840> why<00:00:35.140> this<00:00:35.200> is<00:00:35.620> as<00:00:36.460> somewhat<00:00:37.030> significant

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and why this is as somewhat significant

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.260 
and why this is as somewhat significant
so<00:00:38.710> Diablo<00:00:39.220> 3<00:00:39.490> has<00:00:39.610> gone<00:00:39.790> through<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.060> lot<00:00:40.210> of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
so Diablo 3 has gone through a lot of

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.900 
so Diablo 3 has gone through a lot of
stages<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.620> my<00:00:41.980> honest<00:00:42.280> opinion

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
stages in my honest opinion

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.690 
stages in my honest opinion
Diablo<00:00:43.480> 3<00:00:44.100> instantly<00:00:45.100> became<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.910> garbage<00:00:46.450> game

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
Diablo 3 instantly became a garbage game

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.640 
Diablo 3 instantly became a garbage game
the<00:00:48.700> day<00:00:49.170> after<00:00:50.170> we<00:00:50.320> killed<00:00:52.080> Inferno<00:00:53.080> hardcore

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
the day after we killed Inferno hardcore

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.440 
the day after we killed Inferno hardcore
Diablo<00:00:54.070> for<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.340> first<00:00:54.550> time<00:00:54.760> world<00:00:55.210> first

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
Diablo for the first time world first

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.440 
Diablo for the first time world first
world<00:00:56.020> only<00:00:56.230> whatever<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.970> reason<00:00:58.300> is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
world only whatever and the reason is

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.060 
world only whatever and the reason is
the<00:00:59.110> game<00:00:59.410> before<00:00:59.770> that<00:01:00.010> time<00:01:00.960> was

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the game before that time was

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.730 
the game before that time was
ridiculously<00:01:03.070> hard<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.689> wasn't<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.409> hard

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
ridiculously hard but it wasn't the hard

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
yeah if I played for a really really

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.390 
yeah if I played for a really really

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
long time and wasn't so lucky I probably

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.310 
long time and wasn't so lucky I probably
would<00:03:22.760> be<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.940> little<00:03:23.269> bit<00:03:23.329> more<00:03:23.540> effective<00:03:24.019> but

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
would be a little bit more effective but

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.190 
would be a little bit more effective but
not<00:03:24.560> much<00:03:25.340> more<00:03:25.700> so<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:25.970> wouldn't<00:03:26.359> do<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.900> you

not much more so I wouldn't do like you
know<00:03:27.350> two<00:03:27.709> three<00:03:28.070> four<00:03:28.370> or<00:03:28.489> five<00:03:28.700> times<00:03:28.970> a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
know two three four or five times a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.599 
know two three four or five times a
damages<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.989> do<00:03:30.140> now<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.769> that's<00:03:31.370> really

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
damages I do now and that's really

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.420 
damages I do now and that's really
relevant<00:03:31.880> because<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.810> enables<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.920> player

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
relevant because that enables a player

like me who are interested in the game I
want<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.560> see<00:03:36.799> what's<00:03:37.100> developed<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.329> want

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
want to see what's developed but I want

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.270 
want to see what's developed but I want
to<00:03:38.720> do<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.019> before<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.590> get<00:03:39.859> bored<00:03:40.070> of

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to do this before I get bored of

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.870 
to do this before I get bored of
grinding<00:03:40.850> gear<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.799> in<00:03:42.799> my<00:03:43.100> opinion<00:03:43.519> they<00:03:43.700> got

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
grinding gear and in my opinion they got

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.819 
grinding gear and in my opinion they got
it<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.239> right<00:03:44.390> with<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.870> system<00:03:45.350> now<00:03:45.560> where

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
it just right with the system now where

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.569 
it just right with the system now where
because<00:03:46.760> it's<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.390> easy<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.900> get<00:03:48.049> gear<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:49.190> get

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
because it's so easy to get gear you get

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.599 
because it's so easy to get gear you get
an<00:03:49.880> acceptable<00:03:50.600> level<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.500> gear<00:03:51.769> very<00:03:52.250> quickly

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
an acceptable level of gear very quickly

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.530 
an acceptable level of gear very quickly
you<00:03:53.060> get<00:03:53.299> an<00:03:53.480> acceptable<00:03:55.090> Paragon<00:03:56.090> level<00:03:56.359> as<00:03:56.510> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.199 
you get an acceptable Paragon level as a
result<00:03:57.230> because<00:03:57.709> getting<00:03:58.340> some<00:03:58.609> gear<00:03:58.970> means

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
result because getting some gear means

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.370 
result because getting some gear means
you<00:03:59.269> get<00:03:59.359> acceptable<00:03:59.930> Paragon<00:04:00.350> levels

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
you get acceptable Paragon levels

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.440 
you get acceptable Paragon levels
because<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:00.890> can<00:04:01.010> kill<00:04:01.250> stuff<00:04:01.489> that's<00:04:01.760> semi

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
be just like Diablo 2 a game where I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.800 
be just like Diablo 2 a game where I
would<00:05:00.120> grind<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:02.070> know<00:05:02.250> months<00:05:03.210> maybe

something<00:05:50.430> else<00:05:50.520> it's<00:05:50.820> pretty<00:05:51.150> much<00:05:51.330> a

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
something else it's pretty much a

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.830 
something else it's pretty much a
console<00:05:52.560> title<00:05:52.949> but<00:05:53.340> what's<00:05:54.030> different<00:05:54.360> in

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
console title but what's different in

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.960 
console title but what's different in
this<00:05:55.020> patch<00:05:55.320> because<00:05:55.919> they<00:05:56.070> made<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.430> gear

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
this patch because they made the gear

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.879 
this patch because they made the gear
ground<00:05:57.240> easier<00:05:57.630> because<00:05:57.870> they<00:05:58.169> streamlined<00:05:58.800> a

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
ground easier because they streamlined a

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.980 
ground easier because they streamlined a
lot<00:05:59.039> of<00:05:59.190> stuff<00:05:59.400> because<00:05:59.550> they<00:05:59.789> added<00:06:00.000> some<00:06:00.690> not

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
lot of stuff because they added some not

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.070 
lot of stuff because they added some not
a<00:06:01.020> lot<00:06:01.320> of<00:06:01.349> really<00:06:01.830> good<00:06:02.039> content<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:03.270> game<00:06:03.570> in

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
a lot of really good content the game in

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.189 
a lot of really good content the game in
my<00:06:04.919> opinion<00:06:05.460> for<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.849> first<00:06:06.120> time<00:06:06.389> ever<00:06:06.720> we're

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
my opinion for the first time ever we're

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.170 
my opinion for the first time ever we're
talking<00:06:07.650> like<00:06:07.979> two<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> half<00:06:08.610> years<00:06:08.909> ever

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
talking like two and a half years ever

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.850 
talking like two and a half years ever
is<00:06:09.599> in<00:06:10.789> somewhat<00:06:11.789> of<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:12.060> complete<00:06:12.509> form<00:06:12.810> so<00:06:13.530> for

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
is in somewhat of a complete form so for

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.939 
is in somewhat of a complete form so for
that<00:06:14.009> I<00:06:14.250> get<00:06:14.550> blizzards<00:06:14.909> some<00:06:15.120> credit<00:06:15.509> and<00:06:15.949> at

that I get blizzards some credit and at
the<00:06:17.130> same<00:06:17.310> time<00:06:17.580> because<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:18.840> see<00:06:19.289> is<00:06:19.560> kind<00:06:19.889> of

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
the same time because I see is kind of

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.560 
the same time because I see is kind of
like<00:06:20.070> a<00:06:20.099> console<00:06:20.639> game<00:06:20.849> kind<00:06:21.180> of<00:06:21.300> a<00:06:21.360> game

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570

seeing<00:06:35.050> what's<00:06:35.259> up<00:06:35.349> with<00:06:35.500> that<00:06:35.530> game<00:06:35.860> so<00:06:36.430> you

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
seeing what's up with that game so you

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.550 
seeing what's up with that game so you
know<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:37.569> is<00:06:37.870> what<00:06:38.080> it<00:06:38.169> is
