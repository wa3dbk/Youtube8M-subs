00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 The staff is very good today, I told you. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680
 a hair video how do I do these 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.800
 waves my hair not a bunch are waves 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.110
 It's an easier way I think 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 short hair because often the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 short hair active agent of the times 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.590
 here behind the hair to make bunch 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.119
 The long one then this way I'm 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 doing lately has worked very well 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.029
 because I can do more of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.220
 behind and looks beautiful and takes the front I 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.539
 I can get it right away because 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 The way I do it does not get too much 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.170
 front but accept an easier place 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.329
 receiving bébé very easy you can 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 also talk about long hair I think 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.570
 which facilitates much and avoids that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 mess we do 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.920
 oh my god do not burn me all you 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 can stay with the hand is in the body by 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 your partner will be changing sides and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 I think this is the biggest difficulty. 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.500
 for who wants to do babyliss in the beginning 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 huh 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.640
 I hope that you all can 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.329
 Babyliss is the home of 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 you 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 so if you want to learn how to do or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.039
 less so the hair in a more 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.960
 easy just keep on watching 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 So what are we going to do for this? 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.060
 baby you super easy fast and simple 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 first you will hold your hair 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 with her to little one that you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.420
 I prefer that you guys will like to have 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.009
 learn in the tail high on top of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 head to make it easier to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.810
 you see all this hair to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 make the baby actually so two turns 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.299
 enough to breno a strong is just 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.909
 to ensure the hair and then we go 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.509
 start making the blues or blue 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.000
 days I'll usually do not get 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.329
 worried and leave hair all retreat 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.040
 in the apb iron may be the day you 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 You prefer or leave your hair all over 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.079
 the mouse or china came to be 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 No problem, that will not work. 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.890
 interference will only interfere with the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.399
 So it will only be at the end there you 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.500
 You know I'm putting my hair one 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 mecha opposite opposite 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.240
 front I'm going to do the hair mixed 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 stay all messy yet not stay 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 Everywhere that alone is very important 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.290
 and you do not have to worry either 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.700
 leaving Belize standing all the time 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.140
 he does not lie either a little too 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.640
 has problem does not interfere in the result 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 Last 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.540
 Andrezinho also has no problem, no. 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.459
 needs to change hands 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 which is the most interesting because the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.300
 The harder it is to belize this exchange 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.730
 change of hands that will leave us all 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.680
 burned is very complicated then with 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.900
 hair in the ponytail does not have this 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 concern is one and the same winding the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.110
 incredibly low without concern and hopes to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.420
 time and let go of convincing that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.520
 time to face babyliss hair 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.250
 I did not put my own on the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.510
 low is a little dangerous it has to be 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.090
 careful not to burn the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.850
 fingers but that's the way I can do it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.269
 so I put my little finger in the little fingers 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.910
 It's hot, I loose or direct sunlight. 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.310
 loose kneading the wick to work out a 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.030
 A little more and then I'm doing it. 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.030
 all my hair 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.650
 so I'll give the hair a break 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.910
 cool and then yes I loose a mess 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.860
 Money is the root not to get too 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.780
 Glued and then I'll tidy to leave 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.030
 The way I want it to stay in the end 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.010
 today I saw that I did not get well 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.590
 I do it again, actually in my 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.860
 case is further ahead because the hair 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.110
 but for being average to short when I 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.550
 ponytail is the babyliss I did 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.040
 did not catch too much in front or at most 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.780
 three or four front strands is 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 that I have to redo the case aside 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.160
 behind is all made so I come 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.710
 also backwards or forwards 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.190
 get mixed up and take a more 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.260
 beautiful and there it is ready, my hair is done 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.850
 this in all hair and also the fringe 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.460
 corresponded came to do a thing of 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.460
 light on the rolling field and is ready 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.000
 O 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.030
 So people like you could see is a 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.640
 very easy way to do 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.130
 just a hair elastic and your baby 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.500
 liss is much easier to do 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.270
 You can see that it's your mark on the ass. 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.430
 horse riding you can do 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.080
 get all these parts back here 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.730
 that a short or medium hair one 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.410
 a little harder than the hair 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.320
 Long I hope you have enjoyed 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.570
 to make it easy for you when it's time to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.610
 make curls or longs if you want 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.430
 see box the dog only you are 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.960
 hold on a little more né on baby liss e 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.610
 of course if you have a babyliss 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.710
 better make curls 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.390
 it's like my a little broader it does 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.990
 these waves want the way you like the most 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.550
 use 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.710
 and then you can also use a 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.990
 spray I do not know that today I did only to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.940
