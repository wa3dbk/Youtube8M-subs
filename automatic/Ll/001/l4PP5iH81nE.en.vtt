00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.760
 how about friends welcome to the apartment was left in 8 tb 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 my name I feel relieved has to fall 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.090
 how is this picture in a designer's portfolio? 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.930
 local fashion 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.079
 the model esteban dÃ­az 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.620
 my Dominican republic 2010 and this time is modeling a blue dress 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 Clear 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.990
 the wind pretty cloudy castle god 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.020
 the characteristic of these dark days and that already has little strength and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.930
 dominant blue 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.880
 the color payroll is easily arranged with a correct adjustment of the 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.270
 white balance 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.620
 but the lack of strength is not fixed with anything because it decreases in contrast and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 the colors tend to fall in the range of the cakes and everything went off 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 in this condition elimination 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 I like to work with nature to capture emotion the moment 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 the photo that you have spike little contrast 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.550
 generally with slightly cloudy skies after 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.320
 it's a style that many fashion magazines are so it never goes out of style 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.520
 then since natural light is not going to help me much 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.119
 what I did was look for a color scheme 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.620
 what if he helped me 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.470
 I decided to use complementary colors to at least have a good 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.300
 contrast and color 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.400
 remember the chromatic circle 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.300
 if you do not remember it please from the previous version that is the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.370
 full explanation 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.830
 I had several locations pre-selected but for grown 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.200
 Celeste I chose these broken stairs 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.960
 simply because they are complementary colors 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 Given the color of the dress there was no better combination 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 It is true that I was lucky to have a light blue dress and a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.030
 Red background 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.680
 but that's about work 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.620
 to be attentive to the details now I will talk a bit and the technical part of 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.650
 the shot 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.369
 if you look at the so-called 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.789
 this has a part of the sky that is brighter than the rest 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.959
 this part finally corresponds to the location of the sun that is covered by 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.179
 clouds 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:22.179
 what you have to do is take this area of â€‹â€‹heaven as the main thing and work 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.819
 with our model according to it always looking for volume 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.589
 in this case the part of heaven mine was lying which turned out very 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:34.989
 well because he gave me on one side and the sides means volume 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.159
 remember always vital frontal elimination results in plans 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.299
 returning the technical part I worked with a fixed objective of 50 millimeters to 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.109
 about seven meters from the model 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.819
 the exhibition free farma 4 and the speed duration with 125 now 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:51.450
 second 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.899
 in society 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:57.309
 the shot was made only with a natural without classes or reflectors 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.439
 regarding the final image I generally liked it because it was stolen from the 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.459
 photography to give it more importance model 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.650
 in this case 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.009
 it was not necessary because the same building took care of 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.760
 the upper left side of the photograph 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.719
 this paper approval of the roof of the fn 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.430
 and down to the right is everything 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.749
 by the shadow of the same fantastic staircase 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.749
 here is the final image 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.709
 this is a good example with the domain of lighting allows us to evaluate and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.010
 simplify our work 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.339
 finally the professional 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.339
 people with camera in hand 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.609
 this happens I hope you liked it 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.129
 I am already hipolito and now I say goodbye 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.439
 a hug and see you in the next 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.909
 bye
