00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.380
 Greetings to all HDblog readers 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.690
 once again samsung that this 2013 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.480
 it is certainly among the protagonists because 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.369
 we have all three galaxies here with us 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.130
 note ie galaxy note 3 galaxy 2 is 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.659
 hardly not human galaxy note 1 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 we are therefore talking about the three different ones 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:27.019
 generations of known releases between 2011 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.529
 2012 precisely this year with two thousand 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.380
 felice samsung has updated the line 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.170
 gradually over the course of time 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.140
 months because we can see a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.280
 aesthetic level the three devices are 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.220
 quite similar 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.710
 what is striking is the size 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.460
 the first note had indeed a display 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 from 5.3 then two inches or 3 inches now 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.980
 with which I remember most is a dimension that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.260
 practically it is very very similar 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.900
 to that of the galaxy besides that in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.030
 reality is a 5.7 inch also the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.939
 device width is practically 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.850
 identical sign that samsung from the first 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.770
 generation to the last does not really have 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.289
 increased size but optimized 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.460
 the interface and the structure of the 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.450
 body to make the device 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.670
 practically identical level 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 dimensional but with the thickness still 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.609
 the more subtle the content in this is 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.119
 comparison with notes 1 but also notes 2 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:31.100
 offers virtually the same as the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 self dimensional in this case le 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.399
 dimensions are even stricter 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.819
 even more similar and how we can see 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.619
 moreover it turns out slightly finer more 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.010
 thin that offers the same structure 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.290
 of the s4 on its own level of remittance 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.490
 heidi aesthetic fully changes 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.910
 completely the hardware 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.760
 in fact we have different professors 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.690
 ram 2gb of ram to 3gb of ram 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.230
 then a ram upgrade absolutely 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:04.730
 equal of one gig for each to names of 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:08.530
 12 3 gb snapdragon processor of 2.3 ghz 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.990
 snapdragon 800 with 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.800
 the full hd display while here we have a 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:20.170
 ex 1.6ghz stainless steel against a hd display 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.890
 1080 800 here instead we have a dual core 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.040
 with 800 x resolution processor 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 400 40 pixels therefore also different 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.380
 screens that he clearly finds at 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.319
 solution 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.760
 no 3 in the best compromise min 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.620
 what does this mean if we for example 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.739
 let's open a web page 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.660
 we make strahm that the browsers of 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.790
 devices we go on all in hd blog 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.840
 let's see if we can because the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.600
 connection is quite difficult 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 until now we had succeeded see 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.010
 if we succeed also in this case 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 unfortunately we are connected with connections 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.310
 different on the two out of two in 81 and two notes 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 there are three instead we have the commission 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.410
 a little bit more stable than it seems 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.750
 work better 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.280
 unfortunately the connection does not come into us 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.280
 help we find ourselves again 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.820
 so we can only have the galaxy away 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.880
 then really during 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.500
 the video doesn't work but nothing 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.060
 we are also going to take the menu for 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.110
 example of the applications where we can 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.990
 see how the devices are anyway 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.750
 similar in terms of customizations 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.330
 clearly notes 2 offers some options 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.850
 more than at night 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.930
 113 is obviously more complete than 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.690
 all 82 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.870
 consequently they have 3 if we take the 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.940
 suite esp en for example we can go 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.740
 to see how it is known to have been 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.880
 improved and changed and during the course 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.480
 of the time and between 1 and 2 there are not huge 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.140
 differences while also has all 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.390
 another interface that allows us to 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.120
 have better management of all 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.880
 options with the largest interface 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.980
 as our notes here come 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.100
 displayed in book type format e 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.070
 within the management area 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.220
 of esp en we have a management 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.020
 a little easier easier more 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.310
 complete thanks to the use of various 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.030
 children 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.100
 for example here you see how the layout is 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.300
 similar between one and 2 but completely 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.730
 different on version 3 with however in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.100
 high all the various options and here one 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.840
 fast bar to go to save the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.990
 our turn down other settings 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.270
 that we always find more complete 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.280
 on the 13th 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.450
 change also with the stylus on not 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.820
 1 and notes two we could not interact if 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.950
 not with the physical key while there are three 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.280
 we can also interact with the keys 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.050
 soft touch and side in addition to this 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 clearly changes the subject 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.210
 multitasking on night 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.850
 1 there is no it is not possible to use the 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.280
 multitasking on advanced notes 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.400
 through the multitasking management of 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.060
 samsung on 12 this is possible 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.789
 through the multi windows and on 13 the 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.990
 multi windows has been improved 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:35.330
 furthermore it has also evolved 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.000
 even the multi windows through this 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:44.000
 link and therefore offers a really good one 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.250
 people to see in previous video e 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.740
 vico focus that we did in the channel 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.280
 the settings also change 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.220
 notes 1 and 2 are quite similar not 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.320
 changes a lot at the component level 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.240
 of settings in mind on 12 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.280
 we find practically everything 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.370
 we saw on the galaxy s 4 then 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.900
 in addition to the ntc also many sensors 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.820
 which allow us to use the 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.740
 device through the look with the 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.590
 accelerometer eyes and so on but 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.330
 we also find more options for how much 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:19.310
 concerns the use of the multi-screen 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:21.770
 use of dln ai connections 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.780
 between the various devices, groups play a 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.240
 more options regarding 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.210
 use with only one hand the use of the e span 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.050
 it's an attack division like we have 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.569
 having regard to the settings options 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.990
 also changes that no 3 is already day 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:40.960
 android 4.321 year the previous ones 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.050
 jelly bean versions and we'll see when 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.349
 and if 4.3 will arrive especially for the 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.699
 first version of the known as you can 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:55.620
 then see a story a range 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:58.750
 started in 2011 that had its own 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.389
 upgrade over the years and find it anyway 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.919
 big familiarities and similarities between the 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.569
 first and last version though 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.009
 the latest version is improved in 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.710
 all that you can improve is 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.990
 possible now and with technology 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.840
 available today a hailed saying of 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.210
 hdblog with galaxy note 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.490
 who makes 2013 appointment with the focus 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.490
 when we will have the device available
