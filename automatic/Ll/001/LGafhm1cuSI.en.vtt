so<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.820> study<00:00:06.030> in<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.540> study<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:07.190> did

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
so so this study in this study we did

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.590 
so so this study in this study we did
animal<00:00:09.950> experiments<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.150> basically<00:00:12.150> tested

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
animal experiments and basically tested

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.010 
animal experiments and basically tested
a<00:00:12.719> wide<00:00:13.530> variety<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.250> cancers<00:00:14.820> some<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.870> them

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
a wide variety of cancers some of them

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.390 
a wide variety of cancers some of them
human<00:00:16.440> cancers<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.190> some<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> them<00:00:18.320> Mouse

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
human cancers in some of them Mouse

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.480 
human cancers in some of them Mouse
cancers<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.610> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.360> this<00:00:21.690> range<00:00:22.020> from

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
cancers and in the this range from

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.670 
cancers and in the this range from
breast<00:00:23.490> cancer<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:25.070> very<00:00:26.070> young<00:00:26.220> cancer<00:00:26.520> to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
breast cancer to a very young cancer to

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.119 
breast cancer to a very young cancer to
melanoma<00:00:28.680> glioma<00:00:29.780> and<00:00:30.780> other<00:00:31.020> types<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
melanoma glioma and other types of

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.709 
melanoma glioma and other types of
cancers<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> found<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.520> had

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
cancers and what we found was we had

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.349 
cancers and what we found was we had
previously<00:00:36.719> found<00:00:37.019> that<00:00:37.670> fasting<00:00:38.670> infesting

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
previously found that fasting infesting

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.549 
previously found that fasting infesting
cycles<00:00:39.929> could<00:00:40.260> protect<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> mice<00:00:42.929> from

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
cycles could protect the mice from

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
cycles could protect the mice from
chemotherapy<00:00:44.120> side-effects<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.449> it<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.749> not

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
chemotherapy side-effects but it was not

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.979 
chemotherapy side-effects but it was not
clear<00:00:46.260> whether<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.699> effect<00:00:48.179> also<00:00:48.749> applied

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
clear whether this effect also applied

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
clear whether this effect also applied
to<00:00:49.170> cancer<00:00:49.530> cells<00:00:49.679> so<00:00:49.859> if<00:00:49.949> we<00:00:50.069> protected<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to cancer cells so if we protected the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.360 
to cancer cells so if we protected the
the<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.690> host<00:00:51.929> by<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.679> protect<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> cancer

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the the host by also protect the cancer

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.309 
the the host by also protect the cancer
cells<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> study<00:00:54.989> would<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.499> worthless<00:00:56.659> so<00:00:57.659> we

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
cells the study would be worthless so we

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.319 
cells the study would be worthless so we
spent<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:58.920> four<00:00:59.460> years<00:00:59.760> five<00:01:00.300> years

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
spent basically four years five years

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.799 
spent basically four years five years
actually<00:01:00.809> working<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.149> cancer<00:01:03.539> what

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
actually working and the the cancer what

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.240 
actually working and the the cancer what
happens<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> cancer<00:01:04.650> cells<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
happens to the cancer cells and we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.610 
happens to the cancer cells and we
showed<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:06.090> fasting<00:01:06.510> cycles<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
showed that the fasting cycles make it a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.310 
showed that the fasting cycles make it a
lot<00:01:07.860> worse<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.090> cancer<00:01:09.479> cells<00:01:09.780> when

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
lot worse for the cancer cells when

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
lot worse for the cancer cells when
chemotherapy<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:12.259> provided<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:13.969> even<00:01:14.969> more

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
chemotherapy is provided and even more

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.679 
chemotherapy is provided and even more
surprisingly<00:01:16.579> without<00:01:17.579> chemotherapy<00:01:18.329> in<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
surprisingly without chemotherapy in a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.529 
surprisingly without chemotherapy in a
number<00:01:19.079> of<00:01:19.110> different<00:01:19.530> cancers<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.399> saw<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
number of different cancers we saw that

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.730 
number of different cancers we saw that
the<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.710> fastest<00:01:23.070> cycles<00:01:23.460> were<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:24.840> effective

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the the fastest cycles were as effective

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
the the fastest cycles were as effective
almost<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.579> effective<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.539> chemotherapy

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
almost as effective is a chemotherapy

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.370 
almost as effective is a chemotherapy
did<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:29.039> did<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.759> happen<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> time<00:01:30.930> but

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
did this did not happen all the time but

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.920 
did this did not happen all the time but
it<00:01:31.890> happened<00:01:32.039> in<00:01:32.399> multiple<00:01:33.119> types<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> cancers

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it happened in multiple types of cancers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.639 
it happened in multiple types of cancers
and<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.270> those<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.990> course<00:01:37.229> very

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
and in so those are of course very

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.209 
and in so those are of course very
exciting<00:01:38.549> results<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.090> us<00:01:39.210> yeah<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.469> the

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
exciting results for us yeah so the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.090 
exciting results for us yeah so the
focus<00:01:42.710> it's<00:01:43.710> been<00:01:44.219> an<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.390> Magic<00:01:45.780> Bullet<00:01:46.100> how

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
focus it's been an the Magic Bullet how

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
focus it's been an the Magic Bullet how
do<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.399> kill<00:01:47.969> a<00:01:48.359> cancer<00:01:49.049> cell<00:01:50.000> primarily<00:01:51.320> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
do you kill a cancer cell primarily and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.069 
do you kill a cancer cell primarily and
so<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.490> papers<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.899> in

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so what these papers show that in

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.999 
so what these papers show that in
addition<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.990> after<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> cancer<00:01:58.859> by

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
addition to going after the cancer by

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.789 
addition to going after the cancer by
just<00:01:59.280> protecting<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> normal<00:02:00.270> cells<00:02:00.619> here<00:02:01.619> we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
just protecting the normal cells here we

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.520 
just protecting the normal cells here we
are<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.070> showing<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.689> maybe<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> go

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
are so showing that maybe one way to go

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.039 
are so showing that maybe one way to go
after<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> cancer<00:02:05.249> cells<00:02:05.520> specifically<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
after the cancer cells specifically is

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.609 
after the cancer cells specifically is
not<00:02:07.109> by<00:02:07.670> figuring<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.880> or<00:02:09.810> finding<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> magic

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
not by figuring out or finding a magic

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
not by figuring out or finding a magic
bullet<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.130> by<00:02:11.790> creating<00:02:12.620> environment

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
bullet but by creating environment

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.699 
bullet but by creating environment
extreme<00:02:14.129> environments<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.900> normal<00:02:16.530> cell

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
extreme environments that a normal cell

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.930 
extreme environments that a normal cell
can<00:02:16.890> respond<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
can respond to in a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300 
can respond to in a
cancer<00:02:18.330> cell<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.780> unable<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.380> respond<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
cancer cell is unable to respond to and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.840 
cancer cell is unable to respond to and
so<00:02:20.850> D<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.440> each<00:02:22.680> mutation<00:02:23.400> with<00:02:23.550> each

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
so D is with each mutation with each

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.600 
so D is with each mutation with each
oncogenic<00:02:24.600> mutation<00:02:25.380> or<00:02:25.530> tumor<00:02:26.220> suppressor

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
oncogenic mutation or tumor suppressor

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.690 
oncogenic mutation or tumor suppressor
mutations<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.930> tumor<00:02:28.170> acquires<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
mutations that a tumor acquires the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.820 
mutations that a tumor acquires the
tumor<00:02:30.120> has<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.660> give<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:31.020> something<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.680> we

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
tumor has to give up something and we

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.430 
tumor has to give up something and we
think<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.280> something<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.690> ability<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
think that something is the ability to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.430 
think that something is the ability to
deal<00:02:35.100> with<00:02:35.550> extreme<00:02:36.000> environments<00:02:36.690> fasting

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
deal with extreme environments fasting

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.470 
deal with extreme environments fasting
is<00:02:37.620> probably<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.610> most<00:02:38.850> extreme<00:02:39.330> or

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
is probably the most extreme or

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.850 
is probably the most extreme or

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
certainly one of the most extreme

environments that you can encounter and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350 
environments that you can encounter and
that's<00:02:43.380> where<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:44.070> why<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
that's where we why we think that the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.750 
that's where we why we think that the
cancer<00:02:45.810> cells<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.110> such<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.610> difficult<00:02:47.610> time

cancer cells have such a difficult time

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.840 
cancer cells have such a difficult time
dealing<00:02:48.150> with<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.850> major

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
dealing with it because there are major

mutations that cause a growth advantage

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.410 
mutations that cause a growth advantage
and<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.560> normal<00:04:01.830> conditions<00:04:02.310> they<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.180> lost

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240 
and in normal conditions they have lost
the<00:04:03.690> ability<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.140> deal<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.560> stress<00:04:04.680> caused

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the ability to deal with stress caused

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.730 
the ability to deal with stress caused
by<00:04:05.280> fasting

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
by fasting

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.980 
by fasting
so<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:07.550> fasting<00:04:08.030> have<00:04:08.330> an<00:04:08.420> application

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
so that's fasting have an application

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.410 
so that's fasting have an application
for<00:04:09.140> cancer<00:04:09.470> patients<00:04:09.820> yes<00:04:10.820> there<00:04:11.090> are<00:04:11.120> a

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
for cancer patients yes there are a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.510 
for cancer patients yes there are a

the<00:04:46.280> concept<00:04:46.700> into<00:04:46.970> people<00:04:47.390> because<00:04:47.600> we<00:04:48.230> felt

the concept into people because we felt

our results at the ASCO annual meeting

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.830 
our results at the ASCO annual meeting
in<00:05:38.990> June<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.950> think<00:05:40.010> because<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.210> results<00:05:41.750> are

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
in June I think because the results are

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.970 
in June I think because the results are
so<00:05:42.050> remarkable

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
so remarkable

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.870 
so remarkable
we<00:05:43.430> think<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:44.830> oncologists<00:05:45.830> who<00:05:45.980> are<00:05:46.550> in

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
we think that oncologists who are in

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.850 
we think that oncologists who are in
fact<00:05:47.210> in<00:05:47.360> charge<00:05:47.660> of<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.020> diet<00:05:48.230> of<00:05:48.530> their

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
fact in charge of the diet of their

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.360 
fact in charge of the diet of their
cancer<00:05:49.160> patient<00:05:49.760> should<00:05:50.240> consider<00:05:51.070> for<00:05:52.070> a

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
cancer patient should consider for a

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.060 
cancer patient should consider for a
particular<00:05:53.030> type<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.240> patient<00:05:53.810> who<00:05:54.590> may<00:05:54.860> not

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
particular type of patient who may not

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.520 
particular type of patient who may not
have<00:05:55.400> other<00:05:55.700> options<00:05:56.330> should<00:05:56.930> consider<00:05:57.320> the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
have other options should consider the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.300 
have other options should consider the
fasting<00:05:57.980> right<00:05:58.130> now<00:05:58.400> and<00:05:59.410> in<00:06:00.410> determine

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
fasting right now and in determine

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.760 
fasting right now and in determine
whether<00:06:01.610> in<00:06:01.940> their<00:06:02.150> opinion<00:06:02.660> the<00:06:03.170> preclinical

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
whether in their opinion the preclinical

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.790 
whether in their opinion the preclinical
data<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.930> preliminary<00:06:05.930> clinical<00:06:06.650> data

data and the preliminary clinical data

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.060 
data and the preliminary clinical data
that<00:06:06.890> is<00:06:07.100> available<00:06:07.280> is<00:06:07.760> sufficient<00:06:08.630> to<00:06:09.170> make

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
that is available is sufficient to make

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.010 
that is available is sufficient to make
the<00:06:10.190> decision<00:06:10.730> that<00:06:10.760> they<00:06:11.000> should<00:06:11.270> fast<00:06:11.570> in

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
the decision that they should fast in

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.600 
the decision that they should fast in
combination<00:06:12.740> with<00:06:12.860> chemotherapy<00:06:13.100> so<00:06:13.460> we

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
combination with chemotherapy so we

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.270 
combination with chemotherapy so we
don't<00:06:13.850> suggest<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.840> patient<00:06:15.290> goes<00:06:16.100> out

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
don't suggest that the patient goes out

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.030 
don't suggest that the patient goes out
and<00:06:16.700> does<00:06:17.060> this<00:06:17.300> on<00:06:17.450> their<00:06:17.600> own<00:06:17.720> because<00:06:18.040> there

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
and does this on their own because there

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.580 
and does this on their own because there
are

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
are

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.950 
are
potential<00:06:20.190> problem<00:06:21.120> associated<00:06:21.690> with<00:06:21.780> it

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
potential problem associated with it

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.960 
potential problem associated with it
like<00:06:22.130> reduction<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.220> blood<00:06:23.430> pressure

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
like reduction in blood pressure

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.420 
like reduction in blood pressure
and<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.960> there<00:06:25.169> and<00:06:25.650> for<00:06:25.980> patient<00:06:26.310> for

and and there and for patient for

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.890 
and and there and for patient for
example<00:06:26.700> they<00:06:26.760> lost<00:06:26.970> a<00:06:27.090> lot<00:06:27.210> of<00:06:27.270> weight<00:06:27.450> this

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
example they lost a lot of weight this

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.750 
example they lost a lot of weight this
could<00:06:28.139> be<00:06:28.230> very<00:06:28.440> problematic<00:06:28.680> so<00:06:29.370> the

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
could be very problematic so the

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.870 
could be very problematic so the
oncologists<00:06:30.450> need<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.200> be<00:06:31.320> in<00:06:31.380> charge<00:06:31.820> or<00:06:32.820> a

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
oncologists need to be in charge or a

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.360 
oncologists need to be in charge or a
physician<00:06:33.570> needs<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.870> be<00:06:33.960> in<00:06:34.020> charge<00:06:34.320> and<00:06:34.590> but

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
physician needs to be in charge and but

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.950 
physician needs to be in charge and but
together<00:06:35.550> with<00:06:35.910> the<00:06:36.000> physician<00:06:36.540> they<00:06:36.750> can

together with the physician they can

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.379 
together with the physician they can
make<00:06:37.139> the<00:06:37.350> determination<00:06:37.830> of<00:06:38.580> whether<00:06:38.760> this

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
make the determination of whether this

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.140 
make the determination of whether this
is<00:06:39.630> something<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.139> they<00:06:40.440> want<00:06:40.770> to<00:06:41.150> attempt

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
is something that they want to attempt

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.990 
is something that they want to attempt
even<00:06:42.510> before<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:44.280> clinical<00:06:44.610> trial<00:06:44.820> is
