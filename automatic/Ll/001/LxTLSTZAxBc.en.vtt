as<00:01:51.360> graduates<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.310> no<00:01:53.310> no<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.420> mainly

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
as graduates here no no we are mainly

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
as graduates here no no we are mainly
talking<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.649> strategic<00:01:55.979> thinkers<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
talking about strategic thinkers of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
talking about strategic thinkers of
course<00:01:56.939> diplomacy<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:58.409> possible

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
course diplomacy is maybe possible

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.999 
course diplomacy is maybe possible
career<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.170> many<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> our

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
career for them so I think many of our

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.459 
career for them so I think many of our
graduates<00:02:02.340> window<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> Ministry

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
graduates window and then go to Ministry

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.990 
graduates window and then go to Ministry
of<00:02:04.500> Foreign<00:02:04.920> Affairs<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.369> their<00:02:05.549> countries

of Foreign Affairs of their countries

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
of Foreign Affairs of their countries
and<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.630> why<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.459> give<00:02:08.819> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and so on because why we will give a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
and so on because why we will give a
very<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.539> course<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.110> Russian<00:02:10.379> language<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the world and it's a great opportunity

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.500 
the world and it's a great opportunity
to<00:02:49.349> learn<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.709> language<00:02:50.040> also<00:02:50.510> fascinated

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
to learn some language also fascinated

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.210 
to learn some language also fascinated
by<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.690> fact<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.409> isn't<00:02:52.799> what<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.950> thought

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
by the fact that it isn't what I thought

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.009 
by the fact that it isn't what I thought
in<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:53.849> just<00:02:53.909> politics<00:02:54.750> and

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
in that it's not just politics and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720 
in that it's not just politics and
government<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.829> it's<00:02:56.190> not<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.609> want

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
government so it's not just if you want

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.860

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
because truly international environment

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.430 
because truly international environment
is<00:04:31.540> impossible<00:04:32.080> for<00:04:32.110> without<00:04:33.100> Russians

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
is impossible for without Russians

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.250 
is impossible for without Russians
especially<00:04:35.440> now<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:37.270> finally<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> think<00:04:38.169> we

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
especially now so so finally I think we

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.370
