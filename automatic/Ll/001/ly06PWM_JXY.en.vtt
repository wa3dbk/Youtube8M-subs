multiplayer<00:01:35.939> play<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.360> fact<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
multiplayer play in fact it actually I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.319 
multiplayer play in fact it actually I
might<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> hammer<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
might have the hammer in that I have to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
might have the hammer in that I have to
check<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.020> should<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> pretty<00:01:40.500> girl<00:01:40.650> we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
check that I should be a pretty girl we

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.050 
check that I should be a pretty girl we
should<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> hammer

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
should have the hammer

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
should have the hammer
mm<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.170> hammer<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.470> second<00:01:43.920> DLC

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
mm that's a hammer that second DLC

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950 
mm that's a hammer that second DLC
weapon<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.600> should<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
weapon and I think we should have like a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
weapon and I think we should have like a
proper<00:01:46.380> hammer<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.070> good<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
proper hammer and it would be good to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.429 
proper hammer and it would be good to
hit<00:01:47.520> people<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.119> guess<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
hit people with that I guess and it's
