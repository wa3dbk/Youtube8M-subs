corner sensors a little less common but

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
corner sensors a little less common but
they're<00:00:19.800> starting<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.279> pervade<00:00:20.730> across<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
they're starting to pervade across the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
automotive industry now in the back of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
automotive industry now in the back of
course<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.789> more<00:00:23.970> sensors<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.630> well<00:00:25.260> as

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
course we have more sensors as well as

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
course we have more sensors as well as
the<00:00:25.710> rear<00:00:25.920> camera<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.760> look<00:00:26.970> straight<00:00:27.210> back

the rear camera they look straight back

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
the rear camera they look straight back
which<00:00:27.660> gives<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> car<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> ability<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> do

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
which gives the car the ability to do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.099 
which gives the car the ability to do
some<00:00:29.250> image<00:00:29.550> recognition<00:00:29.789> especially<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the mirrors and front cameras that can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
the mirrors and front cameras that can
also<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.120> taken<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.600> play<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
also be taken into play all you have to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
also be taken into play all you have to
add<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> turn<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> wheel

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
add to that is a way to turn the wheel

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
add to that is a way to turn the wheel
that's<00:00:43.110> where<00:00:43.290> electric<00:00:43.829> power<00:00:44.040> steering<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that's where electric power steering is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.540 
that's where electric power steering is
very<00:00:45.329> critical<00:00:45.750> lots<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.739> cars<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.129> using<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
very critical lots of cars are using it

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
very critical lots of cars are using it
now<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.910> fuel<00:00:48.539> efficiency<00:00:48.750> let's<00:00:49.559> drag<00:00:49.800> on

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
now for fuel efficiency let's drag on

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860 
now for fuel efficiency let's drag on
the<00:00:50.100> engine<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.879> while<00:00:51.090> you're<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.480> that's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the engine but while you're at it that's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
the engine but while you're at it that's
a<00:00:52.050> computer<00:00:52.530> addressable<00:00:53.340> steering<00:00:53.850> rack

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
a computer addressable steering rack

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
a computer addressable steering rack
unlike<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> old<00:00:54.690> dumb<00:00:55.020> hydraulic<00:00:55.620> rams<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
unlike the old dumb hydraulic rams it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
unlike the old dumb hydraulic rams it
all<00:00:56.520> comes<00:00:56.730> together<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.210> software<00:00:57.690> let<00:00:57.960> me

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
all comes together with software let me

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.670 
all comes together with software let me
show<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:59.989> ok<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> enable<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> automatic

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
show you ok I enable the automatic

show you ok I enable the automatic
parking<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.820> cars<00:01:03.180> says<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
parking and now the cars says is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509 
parking and now the cars says is
scanning<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> parking<00:01:05.010> space<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.430> the
