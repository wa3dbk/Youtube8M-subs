00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello guys used my channel me 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.919
 serves today new super recipe no 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 I would know how to call if the mousse of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.320
 tuna in the area I had suffered in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320
 kitchen 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.940
 the boys the first thing to do is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.810
 take a bowl of these injuries 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.040
 we will need it to start all the ingredients 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.809
 so take link we're going to put 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 are 160 grams of back in this case 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:45.150
 then a spoonful of juice is drained 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:52.700
 of lemon of a spoon of black pepper 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.700
 ground a tablespoon of oregano 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 at this point you can an egg white 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 use either an egg white or even an 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.360
 new definitive whole to the recipe 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.890
 it works the same clearly on the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.890
 just a white one and you will want some calories 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.619
