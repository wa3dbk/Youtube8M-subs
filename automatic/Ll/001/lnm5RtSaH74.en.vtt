00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.274
Congrats, guys.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.244
(Amy)
Uh, well, wait.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.045
Thank you.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.482
Um, okay, you can sit.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.285
So, as you all
know, I'm Amy.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.054
And as I'm
sure you also know,

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:25.325
I'd like to do something
a little more special

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.895
than what we've been seeing so
far tonight.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:37.437
When I first met Becca,
I was all, "What the hecka?"

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:41.642
We'd go to a club together
in all kinds of weather.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:48.081
She slept with so many guys,
I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.717
'Cause it was
so many.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.754
She once went black.

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:57.691
And we thought she'd
never come back.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.195
But then she met Dan.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.230
He was a white man.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.568
The only problem was
that Dan and I once dated,

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:12.573
a fact Becca always hated!

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.676
But then they
went to therapy.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.679
And now they are
so happ-y.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:24.218
So let's raise
a glass to the--

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.787
This wedding is slammin'!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.989
Okay, you guys,
let's dance.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.123
She never sticks
the landing.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.160
Is this Veuve--
What is it?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.095
Dom-- Slammin'.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.265
â™ª

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.368
And may God
bless Rebecca's family,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.904
who are still trying to find
the monster

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.139
who killed their beautiful
daughter.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.142
Everyone wanted me to say
a couple words, just--

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.280
Uh, I guess, uh, one of
Rebecca's friends

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.316
would like to
say a few words.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.889
Hey, guys, I'm Amy.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.791
So I wrote something
that I think

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.261
expresses
how we all feel.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:08.795
Here goes.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.130
Does this come out?

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:11.899
Yes.
You don't care?

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.334
Quite all right.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.204
Rebecca has gone
to a better place,

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:22.209
and I already
miss her face.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:26.680
I'm sure whoever killed
her has gone far away.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:31.351
It would be best to stop
looking and start a new day.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:37.090
The saddest part is
that Dan is now alone,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:42.329
but he should know that he can
always call me on the phone.

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:49.102
So let's raise a glass
to a beautiful lass.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.805
Dan can also message
me on Facebook

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.640
and I put my number
up on my Instagram.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.645
Is this Veuve?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.880
Dom?

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.048
Oh-- Is that okay?

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:04.618
("Law &amp; Order" sting)

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:08.488
You're not answering
my questions!

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.225
Where were you on the
night Rebecca was killed?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.427
So let's raise
a glass...

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.329
(gavel banging)

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:18.065
If you do that one more time,
I'm gonna lose my (bleep).

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.733
I didn't mean it.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.437
I sincerely apologize.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:27.708
And I swear I'm not
guilty, you guys.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.443
I'm freaking out.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:30.577
(gavel banging)

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.916
Any last words?

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:50.097
Rebecca's husband was
never in love with her.

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:53.767
I hope I get a call
from the governor.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.802
So let's raise a glaaaaa...

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.205
(electric buzzing)
... sssssssss....

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.944
I'm sorry, I just
couldn't take it anymore.
