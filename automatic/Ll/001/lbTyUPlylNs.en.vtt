there's a little bit of a rough edge is

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.460 
there's a little bit of a rough edge is
to<00:00:21.200> fold<00:00:21.770> over<00:00:22.070> these<00:00:22.369> first<00:00:22.669> two<00:00:23.000> boxes<00:00:23.540> so

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
to fold over these first two boxes so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.920 
to fold over these first two boxes so
that<00:00:24.680> they<00:00:24.830> overlap<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.970> second<00:00:26.329> two<00:00:26.480> boxes
