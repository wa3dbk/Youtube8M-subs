here's<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.550> ways<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.060> tell<00:00:45.240> if

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
here's one of the ways you can tell if

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
here's one of the ways you can tell if
the<00:00:45.450> people<00:00:45.720> who<00:00:45.810> sharpen<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.290> skates<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the people who sharpen your skates did a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.070 
the people who sharpen your skates did a
good<00:00:47.010> job<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.580> when<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.720> your<00:00:48.750> skates

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
good job or not when you get your skates

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.630 
good job or not when you get your skates
sharp<00:00:49.380> and<00:00:49.590> you'll<00:00:49.680> notice<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.040> in<00:00:50.280> between

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
sharp and you'll notice that in between

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
sharp and you'll notice that in between
the<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:50.940> edges<00:00:51.150> there<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.290> parallel

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the two edges there are some parallel

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.140 
the two edges there are some parallel
lines<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.250> should<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.700> they<00:00:53.880> did<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
lines that should be if they did it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.360 
lines that should be if they did it
correctly<00:00:54.300> should<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.989> parallel<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.190> two

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
correctly should be parallel to the two

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.190 
correctly should be parallel to the two
edges<00:00:56.700> of<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:56.850> skates<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.840> up<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.110> down

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
edges of your skates going up and down

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.950 
edges of your skates going up and down
the<00:00:58.830> length<00:00:59.040> of<00:00:59.220> your<00:00:59.280> skate<00:00:59.640> however<00:01:00.630> if<00:01:00.840> they

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the length of your skate however if they

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
the length of your skate however if they
did<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> wrong<00:01:01.440> you'll<00:01:02.040> notice<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
did it wrong you'll notice that the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.430 
did it wrong you'll notice that the
lines<00:01:02.730> aren't<00:01:02.940> parallel<00:01:03.300> they're<00:01:03.570> diagonal

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
lines aren't parallel they're diagonal

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.620 
lines aren't parallel they're diagonal
and<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.520> is<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.000> they<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.360> their

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and this is because they had their

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740 
and this is because they had their
balance<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.610> skate<00:01:08.820> sharpener<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
balance off on the skate sharpener you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.850 
balance off on the skate sharpener you
need<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.530> them<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
need to go back and make them do it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
need to go back and make them do it
again<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> best<00:01:12.390> ways<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> penetrate

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
again one of the best ways to penetrate

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900 
again one of the best ways to penetrate
a<00:01:13.229> shot-blocking<00:01:13.800> defense<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> through<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> lot

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
a shot-blocking defense is through a lot

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.150 
a shot-blocking defense is through a lot
of<00:01:15.030> cross<00:01:15.300> ice<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> perimeter<00:01:16.170> passing<00:01:16.619> for

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
of cross ice and perimeter passing for

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.980 
of cross ice and perimeter passing for
example<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> offensive<00:01:18.270> defenseman<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
example the offensive defenseman at the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
example the offensive defenseman at the
blue<00:01:19.170> line<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.190> Chris<00:01:20.700> passes<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
blue line can make what Chris passes to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
blue line can make what Chris passes to
the<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.570> defenseman<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> forth<00:01:23.070> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the other defenseman back and forth as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.219 
the other defenseman back and forth as
well<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.820> faking<00:01:24.180> passes<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> forwards

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
well as faking passes to the forwards

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.290 
well as faking passes to the forwards
indeed<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> passes<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.030> target

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
indeed if the passes are on target

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.999 
indeed if the passes are on target
sooner<00:01:27.869> or<00:01:27.900> later<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.320> opposing<00:01:28.770> player

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
sooner or later the opposing player

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
sooner or later the opposing player
attempting<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.670> block<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:29.970> potential<00:01:30.600> shot

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
attempting to block a potential shot

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
attempting to block a potential shot
will<00:01:31.410> go<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.830> or<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> position

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
will go down or go out a position

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.300 
will go down or go out a position
allowing<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.290> offensive<00:01:34.740> player<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.130> move

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
allowing the offensive player to move

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
at someone on the slide the key here is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.559 
at someone on the slide the key here is
to<00:01:40.830> keep<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> clock<00:01:41.399> moving<00:01:41.729> quickly<00:01:42.149> and

I think Pat you made a great point being

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.010 
I think Pat you made a great point being
able<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:53.010> be<00:01:53.190> patient<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.940> process<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.960> a

hockey<00:02:19.440> player<00:02:19.739> or<00:02:19.950> an<00:02:20.040> athlete<00:02:20.420> well<00:02:21.420> i<00:02:21.450> think

hockey player or an athlete well i think

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110 
hockey player or an athlete well i think
i<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.440> number<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.550> be<00:02:23.880> you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
i think number one you have to be you

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.060 
i think number one you have to be you
have<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.510> determined<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.380> your<00:02:25.560> abilities

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070

have to be determined in your abilities
to<00:02:26.310> succeed<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.480> number<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.050> but

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to succeed I think that's number one but

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.740 
to succeed I think that's number one but
I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.680> number<00:02:29.100> two<00:02:29.340> now<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.570> bring

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I think number two now you have to bring

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.570 
I think number two now you have to bring
that<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.680> bring<00:02:31.890> all<00:02:32.130> your<00:02:32.310> strong

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that you have to bring all your strong

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.820 
that you have to bring all your strong
attributes<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> has<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.290> on<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> team

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
attributes but it has to be on a team

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.170 
attributes but it has to be on a team
concept<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.580> have<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.850> really<00:02:35.880> think

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
concept so you have to really think

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.800 
concept so you have to really think
about<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.170> know<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.709> make<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.510> team

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
about you know how can I make the team

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.540 
about you know how can I make the team
better<00:02:39.989> number<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.519> really

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
better number one but I think it really

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.059 
better number one but I think it really
boils<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.660> respect<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.350> boils<00:02:43.890> down<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
boils down to respect it boils down to

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.710 
boils down to respect it boils down to
respect<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.910> person<00:02:45.330> you're<00:02:45.480> sitting

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
respect it the person you're sitting

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.410 
respect it the person you're sitting
beside<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:47.100> want<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.940> don't<00:02:48.150> want<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
beside you want it you you don't want to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.440 
beside you want it you you don't want to
let<00:02:48.540> him<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:48.840> as<00:02:49.320> well<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.579> that's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
let him down as well and if that's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900 
let him down as well and if that's
passed<00:02:51.870> along<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.350> each<00:02:52.739> stall<00:02:53.190> along<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:53.820> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
passed along to each stall along in the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
passed along to each stall along in the
locker<00:02:54.150> room<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.690> goes<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> long<00:02:55.530> way<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.980> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
locker room it goes a long way and I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.819 
locker room it goes a long way and I
think<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.430> part<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.850> process<00:02:57.120> of

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
think that's part of the process of

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.100 
think that's part of the process of
becoming<00:02:58.910> mixed<00:02:59.910> within<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.510> team<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> mean

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
becoming mixed within a team I mean

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
becoming mixed within a team I mean
you're<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.530> your<00:03:01.760> friends<00:03:02.760> on

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
you're going to have your friends on

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.100 
you're going to have your friends on
your<00:03:03.030> team<00:03:03.209> some<00:03:03.420> guys<00:03:03.570> are<00:03:03.690> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> mesh

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
your team some guys are going to mesh

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.110 
your team some guys are going to mesh
but<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.650> think<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.070> overall<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.790> boils

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
but I think the overall what it boils

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.259 
but I think the overall what it boils
down<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.540> respect<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:08.459> fellow<00:03:08.700> teammate

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
down is respect to your fellow teammate

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.569 
down is respect to your fellow teammate
and<00:03:09.480> wanted<00:03:09.840> not<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.230> let<00:03:10.560> him<00:03:10.799> down<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> be

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
and wanted not to let him down and be

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.490 
and wanted not to let him down and be
able<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.090> give<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.420> your<00:03:12.570> best<00:03:12.630> each<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.320> every

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
able to give it your best each and every

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.650 
able to give it your best each and every
night
