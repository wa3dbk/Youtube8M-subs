00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.700
 welcome to my vegan diet we are going to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.070
 to make custard is going to serve you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.009
 for a lot of things and I'm going today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.410
 to use to make coca de san juan with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.529
 custard and almond 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 the ingredients are 500 grams of milk 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.890
 soybean 80 brown sugar 60 grams of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.890
 cornstarch 60 grams of soy milk 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.200
 apart for the cornstarch 2 pods of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.020
 vanilla and 60 grams of margarine 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.930
 vegetable 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 we started mixing the sugar with the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.300
 500 grams of soy milk 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.850
 Y 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.250
 we also mix the 60 grams of 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 cornstarch with soy milk watching 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.120
 that there are no lumps 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.690
 We cut the vanilla pods and 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.410
 we take out the pulp we can help with 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.410
 a spoon 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.479
 Y 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.970
 in a saucepan we put the milk with the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.230
 sugar and add the vanilla to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.230
 infusing the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.400
 When the boil starts, we lower the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.960
 fire and then what we are going to do is 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.350
 strain it with a mesh strainer a 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.350
 fine sieve 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.390
 with the clean container we return to 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 pour all the contents with the fire 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.350
 what we are going to do now is 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 add the milk that has the cornstarch and 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.810
 automatically put us to remove 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.349
 will thicken in one or two minutes and not 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.569
 we can stop stirring especially for 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.860
 that does not stick to the bottom and we do not 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.860
 lumps appear 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.720
 ah 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.209
 we put out the fire and spread the cream 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.890
 pastry in a dish with a spatula 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.890
 and let it cool 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.370
 after giving it with the spatula well and 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.900
 again to smooth it we put paper film 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.370
 so that it does not dry out inside the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.370
 fridge that is where we are going to store it 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.790
 it is possible that we always get lumps 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.640
 we can pass it through a sieve and 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.150
 then we will have the pastry cream 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.150
 ready to use 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.490
 and now I'm going to show you how it is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.490
 when I put it in coca 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 i 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 Here it looks good, I recommend you 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.130
 do not jump jce the topic of cooling and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.530
 nor the issue of re-cooking in the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870
 oven is to know once a fire and 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.300
 again in the oven because if not me 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 I think there is a lot of pleasure left 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.080
 soybean milk soya the truth is that 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.080
 we like nothing come that you take advantage
