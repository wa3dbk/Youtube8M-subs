00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
see it's going to probably hang it a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
see it's going to probably hang it a
shelf<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> best<00:01:04.049> buy<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
just like a little hanger thing will

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.420 
just like a little hanger thing will
flip<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> around<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> back

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
there's a few simple instructions
basically<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.770> unbox<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.729> hook<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
basically you just unbox it you hook it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
basically you just unbox it you hook it
to<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.150> desk<00:01:12.510> make<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.290> clamp<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it that's the fastest unboxing of all

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
it that's the fastest unboxing of all
time<00:01:31.500> she<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.490> unboxed<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.270> check<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.479> out

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
time she is now unboxed so check it out

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
time she is now unboxed so check it out
now<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.960> guys<00:01:34.140> next<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> warp<00:01:35.100> pad
