this<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.200> filming<00:01:10.530> off<00:01:10.650> site<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.130> my

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
this when I was filming off site with my

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
this when I was filming off site with my
friend<00:01:11.610> Katherine<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> dime<00:01:12.900> it

friend Katherine from do it on a dime it

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.840 
friend Katherine from do it on a dime it
was<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.830> funny<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.640> were

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
was so funny because when we were

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
was so funny because when we were
organizing<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.960> filming<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> doing

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
organizing and filming and doing

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
organizing and filming and doing
everything<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.880> were<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> over<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> place

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
everything we were all over the place

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.719 
everything we were all over the place
and<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> kept<00:01:19.890> picking<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.310> her<00:01:20.430> camera

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and so I kept picking up her camera

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.160 
and so I kept picking up her camera
whenever<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> wanted<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> take<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> picture<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
whenever I wanted to take a picture of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
whenever I wanted to take a picture of
film<00:01:22.470> anything<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
film anything and because we had the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880 
film anything and because we had the
same<00:01:24.240> camera<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.049> got<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.380> thinking<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
same camera so it got me thinking you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
same camera so it got me thinking you
know<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.189> need<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> camera<00:01:27.060> strap

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
know what I need to put a camera strap

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.310 
know what I need to put a camera strap
on<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.049> other

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on here but so if I do other

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
on here but so if I do other
collaborations<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.820> easily<00:01:30.420> identify<00:01:30.450> my

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
collaborations I can easily identify my

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.800 
collaborations I can easily identify my
camera<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.860> now<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.220> bag<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> backpack

camera so now my bag here is a backpack

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
camera so now my bag here is a backpack
and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.290> thought<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.829> would<00:01:35.040> work

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and I thought that this would work

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
and I thought that this would work
better<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.820> me<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.960> said<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
better for me I like I said I'm not a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
better for me I like I said I'm not a
professional<00:01:38.310> photographer<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.390> do

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
professional photographer but they do

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
professional photographer but they do
have<00:01:39.810> great<00:01:40.200> professional<00:01:40.950> bags<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
have great professional bags that you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.899 
have great professional bags that you
can<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.100> specifically

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
can get that's all you know specifically

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
can get that's all you know specifically
for<00:01:45.119> cameras<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for cameras this is not for that but I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
for cameras this is not for that but I
wanted<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.460> backpack<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> could<00:01:48.299> grab<00:01:48.509> put

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
wanted a backpack that I could grab put

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
wanted a backpack that I could grab put
over<00:01:48.930> my<00:01:49.049> shoulder<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.009> would<00:01:50.220> work<00:01:50.610> for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
over my shoulder but that would work for

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.090 
over my shoulder but that would work for
my<00:01:51.119> camera<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:53.009> the

bag and then get pieces that would

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
bag and then get pieces that would
protect<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.500> camera<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.579> work
