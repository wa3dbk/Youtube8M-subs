00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hello dear friends with you max and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.529
 This is a review on 1886 Action from third 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.420
 faces conscious forces raid it down 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.519
 published by sony computer entertainment and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.290
 released exclusively will be in a hurry 4 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.790
 plot narrative will unfold on 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 the expanses of london how you yourself could 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.550
 guess 1886 Victorian era 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 photo on the bloody war between 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.080
 humanity and half-breeds so you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 understood half-breeds are ordinary werewolves 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 apparently the developers decided that if 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.560
 they will give them a different terminology then this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 will be less trivial dick there it is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.630
 just a trivial career choice 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.010
 Scriptwriters tearing at the seams 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 protection of the human race rises elite 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.540
 order of royal knights 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.290
 the knights themselves will be able to sneak up 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 revolutionary for that generation 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.570
 technology and weapons as well as great 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 Regenerating and prolonging property 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.980
 life of the black substance 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.199
 using these fruits of the role of saro 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.539
 Galahadah members of the order prepared 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.239
 great mission to turn the tide on 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.340
 fungal warfare is actually thinking 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 screenwriters know no bounds and overclocking it 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 sophisticated pates on the mountain and was so 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 great that besides the similarity with van helsing 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
 the other world has touched on gi facts 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.210
 real story characters 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
 for example like jack the ripper 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 only here inconsistency jack the ripper 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.520
 wielded in 1888 shaval screenwriter 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.439
 in fact it 's just picky 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 lyrics yes I still stay at 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.650
 opinion that hardly anyone can 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 eclipse it not from budget creation 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.580
 which is represented by bioshock infinite 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.440
 however, no matter how surreal and not 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.570
 the docking was not filled by the given 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.400
 the script still turned out pretty 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.050
 Matured quality and smog 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.270
 put the bar through which you need 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.729
 will jump the future I found myself 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 potential psychic abilities 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.500
 I don't even need the ball. Dear viewer. I 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.270
 I know why are you here watch 4 hours for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.060
 four mowers 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.009
 4 hours for four mowers I guessed therefore 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.050
 Immediately to continue the review without 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.970
 no questions asked 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.869
 the timing of this game project 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.670
 makes about 6-8 hours 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.800
 calmed down of course difficult to argue with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.840
 so that giving 4000 for any game is 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.250
 unforgivably expensive but I have 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.620
 the assumption that most gamers 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.420
 absolutely not following the news business 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.489
 same only in sanctions and appreciation 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.930
 the dollar you yourself saw what was originally 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.660
 Pre-order price of this game 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 was 2,600 rubles and no 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.430
 conspiracy sony with soapy kenson 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.200
 for 4000 is not here for you this valuable 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.209
 life experience is more rational to approach 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.400
 buying games save time and sift 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.890
 prohodnyak and in this case expensive 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.769
 friends purchase is absolutely justified because 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.630
 ford 1886 it is not just washed 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.790
 exclusive movies and such postrelushki 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 everyone represented this real 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.769
 moment of evolutionary jump game 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.019
 the industry when the player ceases to understand 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.630
 where does cija end i'm roller and 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.489
 gameplay begins this is brand new 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.590
 level of visual perception of the sphere 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.510
 gaming entertainment is the greatest 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.570
 texture detailing 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.579
 characters location perfectly 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.320
 innovative play of light and shadow 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.360
 special effect motion blur workout 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.730
 professional locations 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.890
 the game of actors and staging creates 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.540
 such disneyland cinematic that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.310
 once again it is a pity to blink 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.690
 filled with icy courage 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.880
 cruelty mystical atmosphere 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.680
 which plunges you into this 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.760
 gloomy world 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.410
 professional and distinctly sti 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.150
 the right approach to 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.030
 sound which is not 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.560
 will leave anyone indifferent and okay if 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.660
 would such a progressive leap 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.180
 stayed . on the elements inherent 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.310
 film industry but it is not so to gaming 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.500
 the sphere also came up with due diligence and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.210
 enthusiastic of course we can't 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 find something innovative in the gameplay 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.050
 where we are led by the hand and our main 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.910
 the task is to move from point a 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.890
 to point b reserve the mountains 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 corpses but on the other hand that we still 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.270
 need such projects spacing sudoku 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.370
 Does that solve all similar to this in 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.830
 the pier has been watched by a beautiful movie 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.110
 conduct fire aspire to the shelter if 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.450
 we are very touched once we can bathe 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.460
 in a secluded place and knock out this very 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.560
 special elixirs generating our 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.750
 Fabrics spectacular battles good 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.760
 worked fil a character extensive 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.620
 choice of creative and unusual weapons 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.660
 artificial intelligence opponents for 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.790
 which is not even embarrassing and pretty 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.440
 nice balance of gameplay order 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.359
 from scenes if you take it into account 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.220
 specificity in general in gameplay 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.470
 There’s nothing to complain about unless 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.330
 do not touch on the lack of innovation 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.550
 hence dear friends I personally 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.230
 urge you to be more appreciative so 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.720
 how such titanic labor and 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.910
 efforts not seen for a long time and yes 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.200
 it is very surprising that I am so protected 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.300
 from project to most of my 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.760
 subscribers and those who watched the video earlier 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.530
 I know that I am very reader alive but wherever 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.600
 you didn't turn around why you you don't 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.910
 have looked narrowly for what have not touched 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.260
 everywhere you will only see professionalism 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.720
 sensitivity and true desire 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.340
 developers create of course it was 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.140
 many consumer complaints 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.060
 regarding the lack of multiplayer and 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.820
 honestly if you saw what 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.860
 I see you understood that he was not at all 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.530
 some place you would have been doed would destroy 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.440
 all idyll just things in this world 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.330
 which is not necessary and not necessary to create 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.360
 for example transactions in the second part 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.939
 resident him 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.060
 Justin Bieber decided to end up dear 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.310
 friends of the Order of 1886 is not just we will fly 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.349
 worth another eksh shot already kotlas 3 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.360
 and this technology demonstration 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.099
 gaming industry breakthrough presented 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.479
 for the consumer in the form of a visit 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.310
 expensive excursions in which he 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.650
 becomes the actor 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.110
 if hard reasoning goes 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.639
 price tags then I'd rather buy 1 1 month 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.020
 such an exclusive from sony than I will 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.240
 scatter a little less money on 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.889
 second-rate and head and advised you 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.870
 would be the same since due to oversupply 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.029
 conductor players to an extent 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.439
 oversaturated with all sorts of projects that 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.169
 instead of having fun 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.270
 from the next creation they imagined themselves 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.159
 game critics are sitting out looking out 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.080
 ladder in images and compare 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.729
 premade what to say to spend money 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.500
 on the game to find in it 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.389
 flaws and brag on the forum seems 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.000
 Now the task is more important than getting 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.680
 should emotions but for my emotions i really 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.389
 hats off to the developers and 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.090
 I say thank you so much for such 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.409
 every little effort and work 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.210
 rating 10 out of 10 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.210
 thank you for your attention with you was max
