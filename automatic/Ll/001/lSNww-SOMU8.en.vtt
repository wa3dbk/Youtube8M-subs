00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.440

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.650

 things like it is possible to train and whether 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.410
 it's like something improvised 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.030
 dying everything can workout how when 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.690

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 what do you want raid and all sorts of such 3 can

 fans asked to include this goal in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.620
 all tops even top 10 goalkeepers even though you 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 read the internet after that all that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.070
 wrote a fan about this fish of some kind 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.790
 a comment that you especially 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.040
 I remember the mix after all that you could 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.540
 would become a fan for example what is there 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.350
 are you ready to repeat such a trick 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 Next season will see if 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.940
 good moments all serve what you can 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.489
 so do 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.680
 why you mix last season 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.820
 Noted a fight in Novokuznetsk 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.410
 what happened there was also such 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:28.590
 moment there itself a little bit 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.220
 as if provoked yes as if but before the fights 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.100
 and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.480
 but started and we only needed 3 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.730
 was the first fight of your career you 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.180
 once again the entrance fists 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.599
 just but not only so vinyard 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:54.909
 nothing particularly your communication who won 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:57.519
 you or novels for a moment tell you 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:00.319
 exiled last year in the link in liepae 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.400
 what is the general link in lipeyu like this 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.469
 looks but it is not to holt level 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.680
 much lower too 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.959
 difficulty sends yes and you yourself already 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.889
 you start thinking that everything is so bad 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.009
 well it turned out that we are like a murder 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.750
 came back down and here we are somewhere 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.090
 have read that or and payes is going to 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.349
 this season will be announced 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.349
 championship vhl that did not hear the project 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:40.160
 the metallurgist coach said he was 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.970
 still counting on you and there 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.139
 no longer return 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.260
 I hope that we do not yet know the mix here 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.820
 what are we here a little decided to get 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.030
 Latvian language you can sew us to help 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.300
 here look we read here ablaze 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 sometimes during the match the data says 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:14.900
 Driks Spill what it is why he 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:16.460
 It says only to you and I 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.759
 he told you the apostle how do you locomotive 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.940
 this 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.520
 it washers threw here do not remember well 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.900
 as I watched the video he there is nothing 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:30.860
 talked about was so mix and here we are 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.529
 two words written out and bray will change it 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.629
 horror pruning is also like 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:39.639
 horror with these words can be described 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.639
 Riga Dynamo game last season 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:48.439
 no, but no mix 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:51.019
 but in your career you worked right away 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.979
 Does the current succeed balsam with valerie 

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:53.979
 i 'm not confusing anything 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:02.019
 just somewhere passed the information that you 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.019
 supposedly going to Darnitsa exchange not 

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:10.519
 still plans to spend in riga 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.879
 future 

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:15.109
 of course mix 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.479
 but we were very pleased with you 

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:20.929
 talk let's say something 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:24.019
 to those fans who will already be waiting 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:26.569
 New season promise them that Riga in 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:30.889
 next year will play a little better than in 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:34.009
 it's so perfectly, I think that 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:39.429
 necessarily on the clearing of benches all run 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.429
 for to sleep and to have a good and this
