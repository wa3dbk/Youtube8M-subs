00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.179
 beautiful all guys are leo do it yourself and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 welcome to this new video where 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.130
 today I show you and explain how to load 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 the battery of your phone with the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.279
 your bicycle 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 the procedure is very simple and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.670
 fast but the important thing is that you 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 you must have the main component 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 which we need today which is the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 dynamo that turns on the light bulb 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.940
 of your bicycle very well 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 let's see right away how to build it can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 hello everyone guys I'm codeghÃ¬n e 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 as you can see i have changed the background and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 the logo of my friend Leonardo 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 if you want new graphics for the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 your channel my e mail and 4 in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.510
 description today we need in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 detail of four components 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.840
 electronic in addition to the dynamo a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 rectifier of god notes of 8 am 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.310
 for a 1000 micro far 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.659
 to a voltage regulator plus 5 volts 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.040
 is a three-pole toggle switch 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.490
 these are all the components that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.340
 we find in electronics stores 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.680
 we will also need a printed circuit board 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.710
 vetronite forella ta where we can 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.780
 go the components this must be 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 the size of a box of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.670
 plastic that will contain the whole 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.070
 if the printed circuit is too large 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.200
 for the little box it will be enough to cut it with 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.910
 lots of patience with a common hacksaw 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.340
 finally we must also have the usb cable 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.340
 that powers our phone 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.910
 the first thing we do is to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.950
 cut according to the measures of 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.200
 black box our plate with 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.530
 a marker let's make the lines where 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.050
 it will have to be cut so let's proceed 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.050
 with caution and patience with a hacksaw 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.020
 made the first side if I call also the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.020
 second 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.069
 in my box there is this pirine where 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.720
 the hole closing screw will be screwed 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.280
 the plate so that it can 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.340
 enter to perfection we can use 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.379
 a drill to do the most precise things 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.819
 or dig slowly with a 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.920
 awl now that comes in we just have to 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.129
 plus solder electronic components 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.170
 according to this scheme 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.810
 who does this project obviously must 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.150
 know something about electronics but not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.590
 be frightened I put the images on 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.810
 my google plus profile 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.150
 as you see on this side I put 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.390
 switch that allows us to change from 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.109
 charging light paul which the regulator of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.829
 voltage the capacitor the 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.260
 rectifier and finally the latter 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.349
 component that will greatly facilitate us 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.870
 the four things come out of the box 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.590
 wires that we connect to the dynamo and to the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.690
 light bulb to hold firm wires we use 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.000
 hot glue 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.370
 now we finish everything by putting the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.389
 lids and screw the life and that 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.510
 close the box well now 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.780
 we connect only the two wires to the dynamo 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.239
 and the 2 to the bulb before doing 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.040
 but this will explain how it can be 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.500
 made the connector connection 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.870
 male and female on which we should 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.750
 Skip the power wires in the cable 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.169
 usb inside this we will find 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.329
 usually the stocking is threads 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.690
 we remove everything except the red cable e 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:58.140
 the black one 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.730
 Here we are now we save them 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:08.460
 that way we just have to 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.470
 screw the casing back on and it is ready to 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.540
 we fix the box to the handlebar 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.489
 of the bike with two long cable ties in 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.620
 so that we do not fall this put 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.720
 other small bands along the bike 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.580
 so that they hold the wires firmly 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.530
 connect the box to the dynamo like 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.080
 see a green wire will go connected 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.540
 to the mass and the other to the positive pole 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.580
 the white thread of the dynamo instead 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.740
 I connect to the bulb and the other always 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.310
 to the mass where I played the wires I have 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.010
 put some duct tape guys like 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.050
 you see now I have set that ours 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.230
 I do n't light the bulb 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.450
 while instead if we go to modify the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.040
 so what are we going to take the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.170
 lever side to side 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.600
 in a few seconds on our phone 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.300
 the writing in charge will appear 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.790
 here's how you see it will now take one 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.950
 only now 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.840
 ready to recharge our phone 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.750
 well guys if this video you are 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.550
 useful but you have the shot maybe 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.730
 sign up hello to everyone from or then de 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.730
 lands 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:32.090
 new video seen pissing on 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.590
 no it is not stewed 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.599
 because that's fine but you have to escape this 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.259
 power is not his father but who does 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:50.300
 load your ass we'll see what it does 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.300
 go ahead ball of advantage
