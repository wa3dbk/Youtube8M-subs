00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.210
 welcome to a video blog 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.030
 about the construction progress of a robot 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.790
 the idea of ​​the construction project is a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.379
 universal vehicle to build that one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 later, please, too 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.720
 Developing comes first and foremost 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.660
 But I want to wlan the robot 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 Remote control can be around in the house too 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.039
 shapes and smaller tasks too 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 take care of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 As you can see , the mechanics exist 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.230
 of the robot from a chassis and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.059
 a kind of lift with gripper or with 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 another tool for each 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.000
 task the mechanics will be later 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 probably not to stay there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.649
 too windy and the same mechanics 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.899
 here also constantly canted that 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.550
 Chassis consists of two separate 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.070
 geared motors and two cabinets the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 motors are certainly strong enough 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.590
 but as you can see in the first test run 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.130
 Can it be in both motors together 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 12 volt 6 and the current 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.350
 that means I need a star later 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 Battery but above all, a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.100
 correspondingly powerful power electronics 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.750
 So we would be in the drive 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 a robot as the heart 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.560
 I use the one computer circuit boards from 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.659
 bergheim with the operating system rossi 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.400
 I can also directly my camera 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920
 and then close later stream 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 will 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 I have a part of ortrud with me 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.310
 a controller on it a bwm 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.380
 can generate signal 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.130
 this is via the e square bus from 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.899
 Rosberg has to be redirected and through the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 external power supply of the board 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.850
 I could also get up to 16 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.860
 Servus Director join here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.250
 I use the pwm signal to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.990
 controlling my skin this bridge 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.050
 consists of two power transistors 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.720
 from infineon you can 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.250
 deliver a total of up to 50 ampere current 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.250
 which then also enough for my motors 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.310
 Here you can do the first test of the bwm 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.520
 root 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.950
 At the beginning I have the example program 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.480
 used by or flight 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.780
 However, the increase was not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.940
 set correctly and thus eroded 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.940
 reserve something at the end 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.720
 then I have the program 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.360
 I extended that four servus 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.300
 could drive and then I have too 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.460
 my haubrich connected and to 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.850
 first time a motor with a rosberg 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:01.130
 illuminated and the next increase 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.750
 were to connect a robot 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.940
 and here you can see that I am 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.510
 program adapted so that itself 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:14.459
 Even at the push of a button form comes to 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.670
 Finally I have the stream 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.820
 Tried with the raspberry pi camera 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.100
 and software I have the mpeg player 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.040
 used 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.989
 I also have a wifi directly over 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.750
 one as important streamed and not 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.209
 over a fixed connection like later 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.690
 however, the frame rate was here too 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.440
 already very low and maybe find 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.630
 I have a better software for this 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.630
 Well, thank you for watching and
