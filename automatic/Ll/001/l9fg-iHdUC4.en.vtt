00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
been happening for ages I just not
really<00:00:24.119> changed<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:24.539> classes<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
really changed my classes about for it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.839 
really changed my classes about for it
to<00:00:25.560> happen<00:00:25.680> again<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.340> remember<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> used

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to happen again I remember when I used

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820 
to happen again I remember when I used
to<00:00:27.029> play<00:00:27.180> S&amp;D<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> time<00:00:28.289> i<00:00:28.470> used<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> make

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to play S&amp;D all the time i used to make

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
to play S&amp;D all the time i used to make
a<00:00:28.890> new<00:00:29.099> class<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.490> used<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> hit<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.060> trial<00:00:30.390> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a new class I used to hit first trial of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
a new class I used to hit first trial of
it<00:00:30.660> especially<00:00:30.810> during<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> phase<00:00:31.769> fire<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it especially during the phase fire it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.709 
it especially during the phase fire it
doesn't<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.759> make<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.239> much<00:00:33.300> sense

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
doesn't really make that much sense

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
doesn't really make that much sense
because<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> making<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
because if you think about it making a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.740 
because if you think about it making a
new<00:00:35.700> class<00:00:35.940> straight<00:00:36.210> away<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.570> hitting

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
new class straight away and hitting

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
new class straight away and hitting
first<00:00:36.989> try<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.410> doesn't<00:00:37.649> sound<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.250> likely

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
first try it doesn't sound very likely

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
first try it doesn't sound very likely
but<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> seems<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> happen<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> me<00:00:40.050> but

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
but it seems to happen a lot to me but

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.959 
but it seems to happen a lot to me but
now<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.730> don't

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
now that I think about it I don't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
now that I think about it I don't
usually<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.629> those<00:00:42.870> killcams<00:00:43.379> anyway

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
usually use those killcams anyway

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.799 
usually use those killcams anyway
because<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> hit<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.090> bet<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
because I want to hit them bet on so I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
because I want to hit them bet on so I
guess<00:00:46.050> black<00:00:46.260> ops<00:00:46.500> 2<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.920> being<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> dickhead

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
guess black ops 2 just being a dickhead

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.950 
guess black ops 2 just being a dickhead
to<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> way<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.329> most<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> them

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to me in a way because most of them

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
to me in a way because most of them
aren't<00:00:49.140> even<00:00:49.260> usable<00:00:49.739> absolutely<00:00:50.399> love<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
that I love the way they merge the TV

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.620 
that I love the way they merge the TV
shows<00:01:24.950> together<00:01:25.160> as<00:01:25.550> well<00:01:25.730> like<00:01:26.060> with<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
shows together as well like with the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.920 
shows together as well like with the
flash<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.230> arrow<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:28.700> this<00:01:29.060> season<00:01:29.690> of<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
flash and arrow like this season of the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.840 
flash and arrow like this season of the
flashes<00:01:30.380> emerged<00:01:30.650> without<00:01:30.980> error<00:01:31.370> obviously

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
flashes emerged without error obviously

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.100 
flashes emerged without error obviously
because<00:01:32.030> they're<00:01:32.180> all<00:01:32.300> by<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.510> same<00:01:32.600> writers

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
because they're all by the same writers

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.200 
because they're all by the same writers
and<00:01:33.290> producers<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.980> think<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.640> just<00:01:34.670> works<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
and producers I think that just works so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.940 
and producers I think that just works so
well<00:01:35.360> when<00:01:35.780> they<00:01:35.900> mix<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.290> show<00:01:36.530> it's<00:01:36.800> just

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
well when they mix the show it's just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.990 
well when they mix the show it's just
something<00:01:37.040> more<00:01:37.340> exciting<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.850> look<00:01:37.940> forward

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
something more exciting to look forward

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.180 
something more exciting to look forward
to<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.630> be<00:01:38.720> honest<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:39.979> they're

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
to you to be honest and now they're

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.560 
to you to be honest and now they're
