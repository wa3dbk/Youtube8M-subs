00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
very well the engine was so heavy it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.699 
very well the engine was so heavy it
took<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.360> most<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.720> capacity<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.380> could<00:02:47.530> maybe

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
took up most of capacity you could maybe

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.440 
took up most of capacity you could maybe
take<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.950> pilot<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> little<00:02:48.610> fuel<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.120> that'd<00:02:49.360> be

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
take a pilot a little fuel and that'd be

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.380 
take a pilot a little fuel and that'd be
about<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.579> tell<00:02:51.610> from<00:02:51.910> we

go<00:05:16.319> back<00:05:17.099> when<00:05:17.280> they<00:05:17.370> first<00:05:17.610> started<00:05:17.729> making

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
go back when they first started making

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.839 
go back when they first started making
these<00:05:18.360> aviation<00:05:19.080> engine's<00:05:19.530> cooling<00:05:19.820> was<00:05:20.820> a

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
these aviation engine's cooling was a

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.300 
these aviation engine's cooling was a
big<00:05:21.060> problem<00:05:21.509> and<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.380> one<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.710> ways<00:05:22.740> they

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
big problem and so one of the ways they

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.820 
big problem and so one of the ways they
coped<00:05:23.820> with<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.180> cooling<00:05:24.630> was<00:05:25.229> by<00:05:25.500> putting

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
coped with that cooling was by putting

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.290 
coped with that cooling was by putting
them<00:05:25.889> all<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.250> circle<00:05:26.580> they<00:05:26.669> all<00:05:26.820> got<00:05:27.030> cool

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
them all in a circle they all got cool

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.150 
them all in a circle they all got cool
air<00:05:27.509> ride<00:05:27.780> to<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:27.990> front<00:05:28.259> so<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.710> cooled<00:05:28.949> off<00:05:29.130> a

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
air ride to the front so it cooled off a

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.980 
air ride to the front so it cooled off a
lot<00:05:29.460> and<00:05:29.729> if<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.449> look<00:05:30.599> at<00:05:30.720> all<00:05:30.840> these

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
lot and if you look at all these

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.810 
lot and if you look at all these
different<00:05:31.199> airplanes<00:05:31.610> everybody's<00:05:32.610> got<00:05:32.789> a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
different airplanes everybody's got a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.520 
different airplanes everybody's got a
different<00:05:32.910> idea<00:05:33.389> of<00:05:33.870> how<00:05:34.080> they're<00:05:34.320> going<00:05:34.470> to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
different idea of how they're going to

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.290 
different idea of how they're going to
force<00:05:34.770> more<00:05:35.099> air<00:05:35.130> over<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.639> cylinders<00:05:36.150> to

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
force more air over the cylinders to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.580 
force more air over the cylinders to
keep<00:05:36.479> them<00:05:36.630> cool<00:05:36.870> this<00:05:37.169> is<00:05:37.320> called<00:05:37.530> the

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
keep them cool this is called the

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.279 
keep them cool this is called the
collector<00:05:37.800> ring<00:05:38.250> and<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:39.330> collects<00:05:39.780> exhaust

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
collector ring and that collects exhaust

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.499 
collector ring and that collects exhaust
from<00:05:40.500> all<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.949> from<00:05:41.669> all<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.940> cylinders<00:05:42.150> and

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
from all the from all the cylinders and

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.939 
from all the from all the cylinders and
puts<00:05:42.659> it<00:05:42.780> out<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:43.020> back<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.380> keeps<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.650> kind<00:05:43.860> of

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
puts it out the back and keeps a kind of

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.339 
puts it out the back and keeps a kind of
quiet<00:05:44.130> other<00:05:44.430> engines<00:05:45.000> you'll<00:05:45.210> see<00:05:45.479> this<00:05:46.139> one

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
quiet other engines you'll see this one

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.930 
quiet other engines you'll see this one
does<00:05:46.560> not<00:05:46.710> have<00:05:46.889> a<00:05:46.919> collector<00:05:47.370> ring<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:47.699> just

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
does not have a collector ring it just

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.330 
does not have a collector ring it just
has<00:05:48.150> individual<00:05:48.930> exhaust<00:05:49.289> pipes<00:05:49.590> on<00:05:50.070> each

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
has individual exhaust pipes on each

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.939 
has individual exhaust pipes on each
cylinder<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:51.169> so<00:05:52.169> if<00:05:52.289> you<00:05:52.320> look<00:05:52.530> at<00:05:52.650> all<00:05:52.800> the

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
cylinder and so if you look at all the

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.529 
cylinder and so if you look at all the
various<00:05:53.250> engines<00:05:53.669> some<00:05:53.909> have<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.180> collector

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
various engines some have the collector

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.719 
various engines some have the collector
in<00:05:54.659> front<00:05:55.199> some<00:05:55.889> have<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.130> collector<00:05:56.490> ring<00:05:56.639> in

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
in front some have the collector ring in

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.089 
in front some have the collector ring in
the<00:05:56.789> back<00:05:57.289> now<00:05:58.289> this<00:05:58.440> one<00:05:58.650> would<00:05:58.800> be<00:05:58.830> like

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
the back now this one would be like

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.969 
the back now this one would be like

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
excited about it I am back in 1938 a lot

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.350 
excited about it I am back in 1938 a lot
of<00:06:31.409> police<00:06:31.620> departments<00:06:32.550> use<00:06:32.639> these<00:06:32.909> Indians

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
of police departments use these Indians

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.200 
of police departments use these Indians
for<00:06:33.599> their<00:06:33.719> primary<00:06:34.199> vehicle<00:06:34.440> but<00:06:35.430> most<00:06:35.849> cops

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
for their primary vehicle but most cops

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.510 
for their primary vehicle but most cops
are<00:06:36.449> right<00:06:36.599> handed<00:06:36.900> so<00:06:37.530> they<00:06:38.070> had<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.370> have

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
are right handed so they had to have

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.399 
are right handed so they had to have
left<00:06:38.759> handed<00:06:39.180> throttles<00:06:39.690> so<00:06:39.930> your<00:06:40.139> gun<00:06:40.380> hand

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
left handed throttles so your gun hand

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:42.119 
left handed throttles so your gun hand
would<00:06:40.860> be<00:06:40.889> still<00:06:41.370> available

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129 
would be still available

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.309 
would be still available
it's<00:06:42.879> really<00:06:43.179> easy<00:06:43.360> to<00:06:43.479> put<00:06:43.689> your<00:06:43.839> skis<00:06:44.080> on

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
it's really easy to put your skis on

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.239 
it's really easy to put your skis on
your<00:06:44.469> airplane<00:06:46.319> the<00:06:47.319> pilot<00:06:47.679> just<00:06:47.889> comes<00:06:48.069> up

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:48.249 
your airplane the pilot just comes up

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:49.739 
your airplane the pilot just comes up
and<00:06:48.429> lifts<00:06:48.699> his<00:06:48.819> tire<00:06:49.059> up<00:06:49.239> in<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.449> air<00:06:49.569> and

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:49.749 
and lifts his tire up in the air and

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:52.499 
and lifts his tire up in the air and
then<00:06:49.869> it<00:06:50.020> is<00:06:50.519> assistant<00:06:51.519> little<00:06:51.909> slide<00:06:52.179> with

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
then it is assistant little slide with

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.409
