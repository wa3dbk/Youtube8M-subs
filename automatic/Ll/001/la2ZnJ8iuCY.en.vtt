gastric band now the system consists of
four<00:01:12.540> one-hour<00:01:12.960> sessions<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.400> these

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
four one-hour sessions and these

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.990 
four one-hour sessions and these
sessions<00:01:15.830> spread<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.860> over<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:20.000> feel

sessions spread out over time I I feel

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.890 
sessions spread out over time I I feel
the<00:01:21.240> optimal<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:24.150> sessions<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.869> week

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the optimal time is two sessions a week

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
the optimal time is two sessions a week
for<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.770> fortnight<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.049> I<00:01:28.049> also<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.740> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
for a fortnight and I also think it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.069 
for a fortnight and I also think it's
very<00:01:29.130> important<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.540> sessions<00:01:30.930> are

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
very important that the sessions are

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.999 
very important that the sessions are
booked<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> advance<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.860> know

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the the session too and that sets you up

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.470 
the the session too and that sets you up
for<00:02:24.990> session<00:02:25.920> 3<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.700> where<00:02:27.120> this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
for session 3 which is where this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.120 
for session 3 which is where this
virtual<00:02:28.440> operation<00:02:29.220> takes<00:02:29.610> place<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.860> it's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
virtual operation takes place so it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.800 
virtual operation takes place so it's
not<00:02:32.400> essential<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.150> could<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.510> sessions

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
not essential you could have sessions

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.610 
not essential you could have sessions
two<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.440> three<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:36.270> follow<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.990> one<00:02:37.200> from<00:02:37.470> each

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
two and three to follow on one from each

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.730 
two and three to follow on one from each
other<00:02:38.570> but<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:39.900> optimally<00:02:40.530> you're

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
other but I think optimally you're

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.460 
other but I think optimally you're
looking<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.370> two<00:02:41.970> sessions<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.600> week<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:43.440> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
looking at two sessions a week for the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.040 
looking at two sessions a week for the
fortnight<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:46.290> thing<00:02:46.440> i<00:02:46.530> do<00:02:46.590> say<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
fortnight one thing i do say to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.730

anyway three meals a day no no meals in
between<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.610> idea<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.900> you're

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
between the idea is is that you're

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.070 
between the idea is is that you're
limiting<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.860> volume<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.730> food<00:03:27.000> that's<00:03:27.480> that

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
limiting the volume of food that's that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.160 
limiting the volume of food that's that
you're<00:03:28.290> ingesting<00:03:29.600> solid<00:03:30.600> food<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:31.080> it's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
you're ingesting solid food if it's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.190 
you're ingesting solid food if it's
liquid<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.920> get<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> whole<00:03:32.940> lot<00:03:32.970> more<00:03:33.450> down<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
liquid you get a whole lot more down so

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.890 
liquid you get a whole lot more down so
just<00:03:34.890> stick<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.459> solid<00:03:35.880> food<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.390> eat

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
just stick with solid food and eat

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.570 
just stick with solid food and eat
slowly<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.970> pouch<00:03:40.040> fills<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.340> and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
slowly so that the pouch fills up and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.640 
slowly so that the pouch fills up and
that<00:03:42.060> sends<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.450> message<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.930> your<00:03:43.170> brain<00:03:43.230> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
that sends a message to your brain and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.800 
that sends a message to your brain and
says<00:03:43.830> well<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.340> feeling<00:03:44.970> quite<00:03:45.150> full<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
says well I'm feeling quite full and

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.280 
says well I'm feeling quite full and
then<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.709> stop<00:03:47.330> if<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:50.070> liquids<00:03:51.290> with

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
then you stop if you have liquids with

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.320 
then you stop if you have liquids with
your<00:03:52.320> meals<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:53.430> going<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> speed<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
your meals it's going to speed up the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.930 
your meals it's going to speed up the
transit<00:03:54.900> through<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> pouch<00:03:56.160> that's<00:03:56.580> not

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
transit through the pouch that's not

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.500 
transit through the pouch that's not
what<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:57.480> want<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.810> do<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:58.320> don't<00:03:58.500> drink<00:03:59.510> with
