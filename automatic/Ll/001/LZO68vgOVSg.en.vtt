 hello friends, I'm Juan Carlos Grau 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.940
 we are here in the tips with the 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.940
 professionals are the strongest 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.250

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.670
 good today I want to tell you 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.350
 a little that has served me in 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.600
 take time to train before and 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.930
 take after and during and before 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.640
 train especially do not train weights if 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 you have not eaten an hour before training 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.550
 maximum maximum of time you have to 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 have eaten a solid meal of 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.830
 carbohydrates and protein and good 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.199
 before training he took nitric oxide 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.780
 amino acids and glutamine during 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.379
 workout about 10 grams of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.699
 chain amino acids that are the ones you want 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.750
 the branched and glu is mined from 5 to 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.150
 10 grams 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 that's during I mentioned that before the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.690
 nitric oxide during amino acids and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.940
 the glutamine to be watching these 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.740
 amino acids that are used to 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.520
 break the fibers 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.640
 we are replacing and upon finishing this 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.250
 a hydrolysed protein 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.040
 the hydrolyzed protein is the one 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.280
 Broken into small fractional particles 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.990
 and will go faster to the muscle to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.759
 that the muscle then absorbs them in another 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.090
 and replenish when training, we open 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.640
 this a window of assimilation of 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.970
 nutrients through hormone 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.380
 growth that is being released 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.960
 naturally then it is a very window 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.729
 important that lasts half an hour and others 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 proteins take more than half an hour 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.539
 be assimilated then that's why 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.689
 important that it be a little tip 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.390
 hydrolyzed leaves face next only the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.159
 stronger 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.159
