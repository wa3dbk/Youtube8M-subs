00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
looking well look into a Doug schedule

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.850 
looking well look into a Doug schedule
right<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:40.579> he<00:00:41.579> sees<00:00:41.760> BYU<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.840> he<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
right now and he sees BYU and he is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
right now and he sees BYU and he is
something<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:45.050> tough<00:00:46.050> matchup

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
something that's a very tough matchup

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.190 
something that's a very tough matchup
but<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.539> he's<00:00:48.719> thinking<00:00:48.960> about

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but you think he's thinking about

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.860 
but you think he's thinking about
Cincinnati<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> maybe<00:00:54.449> maybe

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
Cincinnati you know but and maybe maybe

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
Cincinnati you know but and maybe maybe
it<00:00:55.110> wasn't<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.680> didn't<00:00:55.949> change<00:00:56.489> his<00:00:56.760> strength

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
it wasn't it didn't change his strength

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
it wasn't it didn't change his strength
of<00:00:57.120> schedule<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.050> he's<00:00:58.289> decided<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
of schedule at all so he's decided to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.549 
of schedule at all so he's decided to
stick<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:58.920> BYU<00:00:59.899> maybe<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.140> maybe<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
stick with BYU maybe get maybe get a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.300
