if<00:00:48.090> anything<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.110> tad<00:00:49.410> long<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
if anything it's a tad long which is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.000 
if anything it's a tad long which is
good<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:52.079> adjust<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
good because you can adjust that if it's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
good because you can adjust that if it's
too<00:00:53.190> short<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> can't<00:00:54.449> add<00:00:54.660> length

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
too short you know you can't add length

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.950

full-size<00:01:45.180> wallet<00:01:45.509> although<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
full-size wallet although I think a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.310 
full-size wallet although I think a
full-size<00:01:46.979> wallet<00:01:47.220> does<00:01:47.490> fit<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.320> it's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
full-size wallet does fit in here it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
full-size wallet does fit in here it's
actually<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.460> roomy<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
actually a really roomy for what it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
actually a really roomy for what it
looks<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> holds<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.060> you'd

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
looks like it holds more than what you'd

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.149 
looks like it holds more than what you'd
think<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.960> expands<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> could

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
think because it expands here I could

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.149 
think because it expands here I could
fit<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.759> whole<00:01:57.180> sunglass<00:01:57.659> case<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
fit in a whole sunglass case and a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
fit in a whole sunglass case and a
