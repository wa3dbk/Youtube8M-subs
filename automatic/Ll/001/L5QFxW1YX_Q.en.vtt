00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi then today decided to do a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 video I saw that I had five minutes 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.130
 had to do and have to make a video in the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.500
 which I explain to you how to make the node to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.509
 tie what I do when the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 tutorials and tutorials have now passed 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.410
 opening of make up protection of how 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 make a tie to explain 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.660
 guardian and he around because he is one of the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 there are even more common knots 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.430
 those a little simpler but can do them 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.720
 even my Czech grandmother practically those 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.769
 so today i'll explain how to do this 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.540
 fantastic world to the tie that is not 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.570
 it is the most common one most business 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 I had to learn it because one day 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 when long ago here in london to give him a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.700
 interview for christian dior not me 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.739
 I remember who the agency is first 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.590
 goal paths or doing this knot 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 to the tie that type those from those 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
 that all these things do in short 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.980
 just roll around and do it now 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.670
 I want here instead I know that the more it makes me 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.320
 this guy comes to me and tells me if a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.619
 very nice boy for mom but a lot 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 more tournai eye for the aipo detail 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.340
 details 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.650
 and i'm sorry fucking god and this makes me 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.220
 No, no, I notice that you tie your neck 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.080
 it is not laxer to read a person 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.759
 like you doing this kind of work 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 should know how to do web then 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.659
 pretty much crap figure it is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 obviously I didn't take the job because 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 I only looked at various other remodels 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.979
 above how you should cry like bandits 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.390
 and the rum and I left with the tail 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.060
 between the legs better with the tie 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 hurt between the legs so we cut 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 short now I'll explain to you how to knot 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.159
 to the tie then it seems a bit 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 quiet in fact I'm practically 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 choking saw that raising in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130
 collar that if a fantastic shirt 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.110
 I stole it from my roommate 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.030
 sorry francesca then the big part 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 of the tie I should have ironed 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.290
 obviously history does not want to go to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.280
 right while the thin part of the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.409
 then tie the part that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 generally goes below or inside e 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.909
 on your left side to yours 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.759
 left side to your left 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.250
 so the result is this 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.989
 your right is the big part there 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.890
 on your left there is the part 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.380
 thin of the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.270
 from this position we are going to take 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.940
 the right side and we cross it over the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.430
 left side in this way forming 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.350
 a kind of hicks the right side that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.240
 now it has become the left side instead 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.310
 we do not buy it will take the right side 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.370
 which dictator the left side la 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.570
 I take is going to put it inside 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.840
 taking it to the outside 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.120
 so we have this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 result now move it towards the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.970
 right and return to the lower part 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.760
 towards the left then the part 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.280
 left that to your left that is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 the thin one returns to the left from 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.970
 right side cross back to yours 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.769
 right we practically did one 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.280
 sort of knotty so all that 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.170
 do this right now and it will be 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.970
 will lead to the result of the del 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.370
 knot of the tie come hurt him 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.959
 result will be a shit if you do it well 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.010
 but there will be a perfect wing 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.510
 tsun ott 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.580
 now from this position it is as I said 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.660
 first we have the big part in the hand 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 right 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.480
 I can't do a tutorial sa 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.100
 always a true vertex we go to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.959
 bring it back 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.549
 in this way taking part 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.260
 left with the left hand 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.110
 then the thin part with the hand 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.430
 left we bring it back from here then 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:34.920
 from this position I'm going to slip 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:40.739
 from the top the big part in this way 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.170
 doing so and not creating two nodes ok 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.920
 this is the basis of the tie now the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.920
 final part we take again the wide part 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.320
 of the tie and we carry it for 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.140
 the first time then instead of doing it 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.390
 pass from the back to the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.820
 let's face this so it will be 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.340
 what will be the front part of the 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.540
 tie passing it in front of the now 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.150
 let's take it back then let's scroll 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.280
 without maybe making trouble we do it 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.470
 scroll down as I can do it 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.209
 scroll down from the inside so ok then 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.000
 we have this result 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.070
 now I do this we take 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.730
 the tie from here the tip 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.130
 is the insert in the front part 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.490
 in this way now all that moment in 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.710
 which will fix it will be the result for 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.960
 fix it I hold a finger 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.950
 the thumb generally below because 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.900
 so I don't know 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.050
 the knot of the tie remains the most 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.730
 outlined and this is therefore a result 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.190
 node winsor not perfect elegant e 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.930
 ready to tow disco 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.850
 now this is over, I have put one 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.510
 I play the trill for a bit cooler outside 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.980
 I put as good if it was hope 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.840
 this closed the tutorial of six 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.730
 liked it or better I hope it at least has 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.140
 have understood how to make one 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.160
 tie obviously I will not try to 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.540
 write the instructions because a little 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.790
 published explained that it is not difficult 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.460
 but it takes some practice time 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.700
 make us a tutorial always on this 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.680
 channel on how to women in general 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.390
 on how to use how to fix 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.070
 I put belts below in the bar 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.030
 some descriptions so if you want to give 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.650
 take a look also 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.830
 appeal I wanted to thank you for having me 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.390
 followed everyone on instagram 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.700
 after the last video and if you want 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.400
 keep doing it you can look me up 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.530
 instagram integrates a dot com bar 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.240
 christian nasdaq in half link below 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.030
 there is also on my personal page on 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.040
 facebook fan page ci va queen and twitter 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.120
 all the link will be below you gnaws 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.620
 a little because it is disappearing a little 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.780
 tanning so I'm coming back 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.580
 to my cadaverous form than that which 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.130
 derives from that not being able to remove a 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.600
 a little yellowish a little purple and nothing 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.670
 thanks now but still given this video 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.880
 I hope it was useful and see you 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.880
 soon
