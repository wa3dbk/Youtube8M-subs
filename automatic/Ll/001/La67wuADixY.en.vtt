00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
first came about when nikki Finke had

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.010

reported that this slate was coming out

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.110 
reported that this slate was coming out
and<00:00:20.260> I<00:00:20.710> thought<00:00:20.950> it<00:00:21.070> was<00:00:21.190> real<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:21.610> thought<00:00:21.880> that

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
and I thought it was real I thought that

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.210 
and I thought it was real I thought that
it<00:00:22.300> would<00:00:22.390> absolutely<00:00:22.810> come<00:00:23.530> to<00:00:23.650> fruition<00:00:23.770> and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
it would absolutely come to fruition and

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.790 
it would absolutely come to fruition and
then<00:00:24.850> nothing<00:00:25.270> at<00:00:25.390> comic-con<00:00:25.750> personally<00:00:26.710> I

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
then nothing at comic-con personally I

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.960 
then nothing at comic-con personally I
think<00:00:26.860> what<00:00:27.100> happened<00:00:27.430> was<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.580> they<00:00:27.910> were

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
think what happened was that they were

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.760 
think what happened was that they were
just<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.690> they<00:00:28.840> said<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.440> know<00:00:29.560> we're<00:00:29.710> not

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
just that they said you know we're not

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.050 
just that they said you know we're not
gonna<00:00:29.860> give<00:00:30.039> this<00:00:30.100> woman<00:00:30.220> any<00:00:30.370> validity<00:00:30.640> let's

to<00:02:58.050> came<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> am<00:02:58.710> already<00:02:59.100> imagining

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
to came I'm like I am already imagining

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.300 
to came I'm like I am already imagining
cap<00:02:59.760> 3<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.090> cat<00:03:00.870> 2<00:03:01.080> came<00:03:01.290> out<00:03:01.440> April<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.130> now

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
cap 3 is a cat 2 came out April and now

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.770 
cap 3 is a cat 2 came out April and now
this<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.850> happening<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.210> March<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.510> feel<00:03:03.690> like

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
this is happening in March I feel like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.500 
this is happening in March I feel like
it's<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.460> marketplace<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.090> flooded

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
it's just the the marketplace is flooded

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's just the the marketplace is flooded
there's<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:06.810> many<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:07.470> movies<00:03:07.770> coming<00:03:08.010> out

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
there's so many more movies coming out

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.250 
there's so many more movies coming out
they<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.880> kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.240> move<00:03:09.750> things<00:03:10.050> up

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
they have to kind of move things up

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.980 
they have to kind of move things up
because<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.310> math<00:03:11.610> right<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.570> think<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
because it's just math right I think the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.420 
because it's just math right I think the
dart<00:03:13.170> fans<00:03:13.410> are<00:03:13.530> gonna<00:03:13.590> go<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:13.980> both<00:03:14.130> movies

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
dart fans are gonna go see both movies

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.160 
dart fans are gonna go see both movies
opening<00:03:14.760> weekend<00:03:14.940> regardless<00:03:15.510> yeah<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> think

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
opening weekend regardless yeah I think

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.260 
opening weekend regardless yeah I think
the<00:03:16.860> bottom<00:03:17.040> line<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.000> kind<00:03:18.209> of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
the bottom line is they have to kind of

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.699 
the bottom line is they have to kind of
spread<00:03:18.480> things<00:03:18.690> out<00:03:18.840> because<00:03:19.110> there's<00:03:19.500> more

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
spread things out because there's more

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.320 
spread things out because there's more
and<00:03:19.770> more<00:03:19.830> blockbusters<00:03:20.489> coming<00:03:20.820> out<00:03:20.910> period

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
and more blockbusters coming out period

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.870 
and more blockbusters coming out period
I<00:03:21.510> also<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:22.110> think<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
I also just think that the the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.060 
I also just think that the the
stereotype<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> what<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.050> blockbuster<00:03:25.410> summer

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
stereotype of what a blockbuster summer

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.670 
stereotype of what a blockbuster summer
film<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.730> has<00:03:27.360> become<00:03:27.780> such<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> different

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
film is has become such a different

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.010 
film is has become such a different
beast<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.430> where<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.300> look<00:03:30.510> at<00:03:30.630> something

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
beast now where you look at something

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.199 
beast now where you look at something
like<00:03:31.050> x-men<00:03:31.739> Days<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.070> Future<00:03:32.220> past<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:33.030> it's

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
like x-men Days of Future past and it's

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.910 
like x-men Days of Future past and it's
not<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.930> summer<00:03:34.140> blockbuster<00:03:34.320> where

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
not just a summer blockbuster where

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.530 
not just a summer blockbuster where
there's<00:03:35.100> no<00:03:35.280> story<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.150> used<00:03:36.390> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
there's no story I think what we used to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.930 
there's no story I think what we used to
see<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> blockbusters<00:03:37.440> were

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
see is the blockbusters were

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
see is the blockbusters were
transformers<00:03:39.320> Expendables

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
transformers Expendables

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.050 
transformers Expendables
that<00:03:40.860> type<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.310> movie<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.580> doesn't

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
that type of movie that doesn't

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.449 
that type of movie that doesn't
necessarily<00:03:42.180> have<00:03:42.900> great<00:03:43.530> actors<00:03:44.010> great

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
necessarily have great actors great

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.120 
necessarily have great actors great
story<00:03:44.850> great<00:03:45.209> emotional<00:03:46.170> moments<00:03:46.800> drama

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
story great emotional moments drama

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.850 
story great emotional moments drama
stakes<00:03:47.640> yeah<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.570> think<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.080> expending

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
stakes yeah so I think that expending

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.040 
stakes yeah so I think that expending
the<00:03:49.980> time<00:03:50.250> what<00:03:53.420> turn-turn<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.630> phone<00:03:54.840> lines

just<00:04:26.240> really<00:04:26.600> don't<00:04:26.750> think<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:27.020> DC<00:04:27.470> gave<00:04:27.680> a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
just really don't think that DC gave a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.950 
just really don't think that DC gave a
crap<00:04:28.040> about<00:04:28.070> what<00:04:28.460> nikki<00:04:28.730> Finke<00:04:28.940> said<00:04:29.180> i<00:04:29.420> don't

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
crap about what nikki Finke said i don't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.180 
crap about what nikki Finke said i don't
think<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.290> they<00:04:30.440> should<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.860> don't<00:04:31.100> think

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
think that they should I don't think

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.710 
think that they should I don't think
they<00:04:31.430> didn't<00:04:31.730> announce<00:04:31.970> stuff<00:04:32.270> at<00:04:32.390> Comic<00:04:32.690> Con

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
they didn't announce stuff at Comic Con

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.570 
they didn't announce stuff at Comic Con
because<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.290> all<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.560> do<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.890> think<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.280> just<00:04:34.310> think

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
because of all I do I think I just think

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.280 
because of all I do I think I just think
because<00:04:34.970> they<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.600> they<00:04:35.930> don't<00:04:36.110> want<00:04:36.230> to

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
because they that they don't want to
