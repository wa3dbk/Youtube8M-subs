smooth ride the speed is incredible and

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.759 
smooth ride the speed is incredible and
then<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:57.120> wheels<00:03:57.299> smoother<00:03:58.230> than<00:03:58.349> anything

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
then the wheels smoother than anything

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.040 
from air and doing some fun little
things<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.820> was<00:04:23.849> really<00:04:24.180> smooth<00:04:24.659> it<00:04:24.930> was

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
things and it was really smooth it was

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.040 
things and it was really smooth it was
just<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.320> really<00:04:25.729> different<00:04:26.729> rise<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.510> from

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
just a really different rise and from

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.710 
just a really different rise and from
kind<00:04:28.409> of<00:04:28.470> used<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.340> totally<00:04:29.970> enjoyed<00:04:30.180> it<00:04:30.599> and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
kind of used to I totally enjoyed it and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.439 
kind of used to I totally enjoyed it and
I<00:04:31.259> thought<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.340> wasn't<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.789> know<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.180> think

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
I thought it wasn't you know so I think

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.550 
I thought it wasn't you know so I think
everyone<00:04:33.720> should<00:04:33.750> actually<00:04:33.930> own<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.259> board

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
everyone should actually own a board

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.930 
everyone should actually own a board
like<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.129> that<00:04:35.280> they<00:04:35.430> can<00:04:35.669> just

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
like this so that they can just

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.140 
like this so that they can just
experience<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:37.009> yes<00:04:38.009> and<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.759> support

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
experience it yes and so you can support

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.760 
experience it yes and so you can support
