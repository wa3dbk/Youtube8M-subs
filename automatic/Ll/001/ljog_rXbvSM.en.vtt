00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.200

 to be inside a system 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.029
 techno we have the courage to oppose it and also because it suits us and in any case 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.249

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.409
 we are doing a television 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.900

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.349
 honest to the end 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.770
