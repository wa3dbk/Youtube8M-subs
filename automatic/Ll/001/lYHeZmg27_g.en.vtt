00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.210
 me 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 Yes now Well then it is Takahiro Mori let alone seeing today Haa 3 and the project Takahiro Omori School 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 Thank you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:32.430
 We will introduce the Hiromi end of the Te ne sheets Umino is today 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.620
 It's been quite many of those who would eh O is too small Kedomo is spread way of you in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.620
 Appreciation Day is each person in this size 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 There is that behavior 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'll do that extra, but it's too wide to go 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.110
 It is not always good that the position of an article goes out of the body though 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.699
 If you spread this as much as possible 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:02.600
 Makes it easier closed trees in nature when it closed this side 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:08.540
 But if it's small, I 'll try to stop it from here, for example 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.450
 It's hard to close, so I can put my pressure on my shoulder and my body will go back so I can 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:18.710
 Just spread and eat 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.460
 It will be very good if you close the side, so it is the most comfortable place while being aware of that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.219
 is not it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.219
 While their own to check the place it 's such easy closed strongly Asugoku 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.710
 Also It is good in the drill work 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.710
 Please try a dip in the suite 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.940

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:47.710

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:52.510

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.050
