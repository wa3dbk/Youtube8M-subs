00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.940
 traditional tourist we are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 perfect composition for this font 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.780

 can put some gloves on medicine 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.420
 the Portuguese saw it very diffuse because 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.070

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.810
