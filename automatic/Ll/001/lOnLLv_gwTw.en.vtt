00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.430
 put it to find it because I have it 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.750
 I searched until I found it e 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.809
 faces a series of competitions 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.610
 choices for you head to keep up with 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.190
 your car is okay not an event 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 special I don't know what it is and let's get started 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.649
 the race we start a race for sure 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.940
 will be a pro patria activity perhaps the 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.119
 car is fantastic 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.160
 my mother, by the way , I saw many 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.410
 comments you told me but it seems to us 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.750
 this car barely starts one 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.030
 alloy is not that it just seems to accelerate 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.700
 part of the car but definitely but 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 really so much so much by the way 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 which is something I want to tell you one 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.909
 what I say I love you if you have 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.130
 force motosport if you have motor sports force 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.080
 my first idea is that anyway 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 many of you always tell me that there is 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.009
 my drive to dar is in their races and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.490
 this pleases me 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.430
 and since the xbox can maintain 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.409
 up to 1000 friends I believe and then there is 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.119
 also the option to follow 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 then I give you my nickname which 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.390
 active golf 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 then for those who want to send the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.640
 send me a friend request 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 now I accept them again then i 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 lucky that they are seeing this 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 videos will be the first to send me one 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.009
 I promise you no friend request 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 I don't promise you to hear that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:20.160
 we will never play together but I want to put 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.739
 in doubt maybe if I can 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.530
 we will record a match for everyone together 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.390
 to force motosport 5 that we will do one 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.400
 nice race all together for less 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.069
 those who follow me then there is the idea 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.209
 me plans camila sincerely i hope 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.130
 you like it too 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.260
 in the meantime I do n't want that 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.280
 nothing but look how far I'm driving 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.200
 well 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.580
 surely now mix between cero transcendano 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 somewhere 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 ok we look it doesn't seem bad not not 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.819
 it looks bad to me 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.470
 go go go go that then the other 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.959
 mister I give b pointed out to me that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.810
 so good the ps but now the car 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.269
 no longer turns if it is true or a thing or 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.170
 the other, however, without ps did not brake 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.840
 looks like I was up on the ice then 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.459
 I think the idea of ​​doing is there but of 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.500
 understand me now understand living so much 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.660
 today we know the talk 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.630

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.340
 cicciotti or the sun to export and but 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.590
 however we have become too many boys up 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.590
