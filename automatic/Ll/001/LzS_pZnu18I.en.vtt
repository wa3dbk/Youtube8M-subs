 target video of gta 5 here I bring you 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.480
 a new secret an internet 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.310
 a curiosity about a dinosaur like that 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.110
 that many people have seen of dinosaur 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.150
 Who knows, I'm going to buy it because 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.070
 I was watching I was watching the video 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.190
 where I saw this video to which a subscriber 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.140
 he sent it to me for private and I saw it and not 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.170
 I could believe in Chinese league as it can be a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.079
 damn dinosaur in gta 5 in normal or 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.059
 online campaign 12 but so better 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.829
 sheep I teach you the video so that 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.140
 you see where I am pointing 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.550
 supposedly it looks like a dinosaur 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 good follow to see the video 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.479
 come with me I'm coming back good 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.609
 friends and the server that sent the 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.559
 subscriber this is the video chooses chinga 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.420
 I can not believe it there like the bato 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.670
 is aiming to go there like this 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.949
 we watching the dinosaur I do not 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.260
 I wanted to say I said here I said I do not have it 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.690
 check I have to check this this 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.430
 click secret or mystery whatever it is 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.200
 I had to check 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.150
 and then through the gazebo we're going to 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.530
 check to see if it's true but to me 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.050
 what I think is that the bato is 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.750
 recording a camera with a cell phone towards 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.000
 pointed the TV and thus recording who 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.860
 know if I can pixelate it and I hope 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.479
 but for that I'm good we're going to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.550
 check this let's try this 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.320
 secret or mystery what is good 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.810
 let's start it and go back to online gta 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
 good friends, I went back to gta online and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 you ask me questions is not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.220
 because you do not prove it with trevor 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 because you are not going to gta campaign or the Czechs 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.940
 so good friends is that I already 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.400
 I checked but in a friend's house it's 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.220
 that this has gta 51 more than the already 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 I'll finish it as much as I 'm going 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 finishing more than I broke down the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700
 console and I had to buy another and 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 buy again the game and good the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 game of the game did not have but it was had 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.150
 I do not have the tones very well 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.700
 advanced and daring I do not have unlocking 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.619
 I still said why not check online 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.690
 all this good already for changing the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.940
 theme let's see with the gameplay to good 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 here I was dialing the number the number 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.600
 they screamed good they saw it complete only 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 He left a video session for you 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.250
 see it and see that the number that was 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.709
 marking was like supposedly the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.019
 dinosaur was marking him so that 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.540
 supposedly appeared I was not 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.660
 as proving and supposedly I 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.239
 I was marking it and I was getting busy 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.549
 I got busy and worried and also 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.020
 he reads it in the campaign and I find it busy 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.480
 Mark like four times 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.450
 worried and busy and here you get not 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.770
 I'm going to look busy so this is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.750
 like you were friends this is 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.450
