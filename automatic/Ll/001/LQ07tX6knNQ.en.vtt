the<00:02:44.670> movement<00:02:45.740> spread<00:02:46.740> for<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:47.910> I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the movement spread for it like what I

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.350 
the movement spread for it like what I
just<00:02:48.120> did<00:02:48.270> right<00:02:48.480> there<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:49.730> 2.45<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:51.210> not

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360

just did right there is 2.45 really not
a<00:02:51.390> big<00:02:51.630> difference<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.290> really<00:02:52.410> isn't<00:02:52.770> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
a big difference it really isn't that

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
know but the recoil is three point six

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
know but the recoil is three point six
three<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.790> easy<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.180> manage<00:03:00.390> if<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780

mp7 from call duty so you'll be able to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.780 
mp7 from call duty so you'll be able to
handle<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.180> no<00:03:06.330> problem<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:08.310> range<00:03:08.550> is
