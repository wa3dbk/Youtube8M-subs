feet between shore and the ice there's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
feet between shore and the ice there's
really<00:01:01.410> no<00:01:01.649> reason<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.309> fish<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.789> big

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
right off the shelf so the eye sometimes

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
right off the shelf so the eye sometimes
you'll<00:01:59.790> throw<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.509> ice<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> let<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> drop

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you'll throw on the ice and let it drop

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
you'll throw on the ice and let it drop
off<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.149> being<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> case<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.439> flies

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
off so that being the case I like flies

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
off so that being the case I like flies
at<00:02:04.979> head<00:02:05.219> dive<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
at head dive a little bit so they get a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
at head dive a little bit so they get a
weighted<00:02:07.229> hit<00:02:07.409> I've<00:02:07.920> got<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> prototype<00:02:09.149> on

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
weighted hit I've got a prototype on

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.540 
weighted hit I've got a prototype on
here<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.410> little<00:02:10.500> snakey<00:02:11.039> type<00:02:11.250> fly

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
here but just a little snakey type fly

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.920 
here but just a little snakey type fly
but<00:02:12.330> I'll<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.540> show<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.170> my<00:02:13.290> walk

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
but I'll just show you how I do my walk

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.390 
but I'll just show you how I do my walk
boxes<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.859> same<00:02:15.069> if<00:02:15.250> you're

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
boxes and this is the same if you're

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.610 
boxes and this is the same if you're
fishing<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.969> put<00:02:16.689> in<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.840> river<00:02:17.079> or<00:02:17.260> whatever

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
fishing I put in the river or whatever

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.099 
fishing I put in the river or whatever
so<00:02:18.250> basically<00:02:18.700> I've<00:02:18.939> got<00:02:18.969> a<00:02:19.120> really<00:02:19.510> small<00:02:19.810> box

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
so basically I've got a really small box

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.020 
so basically I've got a really small box
that<00:02:20.319> flies<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:22.569> basically<00:02:23.170> all<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.530> do

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that flies here that basically all I do

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
that flies here that basically all I do
if<00:02:25.030> I'm<00:02:25.359> fishing<00:02:25.599> lakes<00:02:25.989> or<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.319> I'm<00:02:26.439> fishing

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
if I'm fishing lakes or if I'm fishing

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.890 
if I'm fishing lakes or if I'm fishing
river<00:02:26.950> doesn't<00:02:27.099> matter<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.670> simply<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> box

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
river doesn't matter I simply have a box

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.379 
river doesn't matter I simply have a box
with<00:02:29.170> every<00:02:29.680> color<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.159> in<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.370> fish<00:02:30.609> colors

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
with every color I'm in a fish colors

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.360 
with every color I'm in a fish colors
that<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.599> know<00:02:31.659> I'm<00:02:31.959> always<00:02:32.260> drawn<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.829> like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that I know I'm always drawn to like

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
that I know I'm always drawn to like
black<00:02:33.609> and<00:02:33.909> olives<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.450> whites<00:02:34.689> I<00:02:34.900> might<00:02:35.319> have

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
black and olives and whites I might have

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.369 
black and olives and whites I might have
two<00:02:35.829> of<00:02:36.069> but<00:02:36.760> other<00:02:36.909> than<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.359> it's<00:02:37.659> a<00:02:37.810> super

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
two of but other than that it's a super

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.679 
two of but other than that it's a super
simple<00:02:38.620> little<00:02:39.099> box<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.730> mean<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.359> don't<00:02:40.420> have

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
simple little box I mean I don't have

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.470 
simple little box I mean I don't have
two<00:02:41.409> dozen<00:02:41.620> flies<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.370> box<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:42.969> that's

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
two dozen flies in this box and that's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.360 
two dozen flies in this box and that's
my<00:02:43.659> walking<00:02:44.170> boxes<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:44.769> what<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.099> with<00:02:45.189> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
my walking boxes that's what I do with I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.819 
my walking boxes that's what I do with I
so<00:02:45.639> I<00:02:45.819> mean<00:02:46.299> if<00:02:46.389> ice<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.109> tends<00:02:47.409> to<00:02:47.530> be

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
so I mean if ice out it tends to be

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.879 
so I mean if ice out it tends to be
almost<00:02:48.609> always<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:49.689> me<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.349> dark<00:02:50.620> color

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
almost always for me it's a dark color

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.649 
almost always for me it's a dark color
or<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.250> full-on<00:02:51.609> bright<00:02:51.970> color<00:02:52.269> there's<00:02:52.510> not

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
or a full-on bright color there's not

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.990 
or a full-on bright color there's not
the<00:02:53.139> mutes<00:02:53.439> don't<00:02:53.739> seem<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.159> matter<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.549> tans

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
the mutes don't seem to matter the tans

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.849 
the mutes don't seem to matter the tans
and<00:02:55.299> stuff<00:02:55.480> like<00:02:55.689> that<00:02:56.019> for<00:02:56.590> me<00:02:56.709> it's

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
and stuff like that for me it's

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.890 
and stuff like that for me it's
generally<00:02:57.280> black<00:02:57.519> or<00:02:57.849> or<00:02:58.269> pretty<00:02:58.599> bright

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
generally black or or pretty bright

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.920 
generally black or or pretty bright
stuff<00:02:59.310> especially<00:03:00.310> when<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.000> first<00:03:01.329> comes<00:03:01.689> off

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
stuff especially when it first comes off

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.869 
stuff especially when it first comes off
when<00:03:02.139> it<00:03:02.230> first<00:03:02.530> starts<00:03:03.040> it's<00:03:03.219> like<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
when it first starts it's like that

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.270 
when it first starts it's like that
20-foot<00:03:04.629> world<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.409> on<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.859> ice<00:03:05.980> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
20-foot world it's on the ice and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.890 
20-foot world it's on the ice and
dropping<00:03:06.579> off<00:03:06.879> those<00:03:07.150> fish<00:03:07.419> are<00:03:07.540> waiting<00:03:07.840> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
dropping off those fish are waiting to

ambush<00:03:08.049> I'm<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> use<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> floating<00:03:10.090> line

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
ambush I'm going to use a floating line

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.849 
ambush I'm going to use a floating line
because<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.169> because<00:03:11.500> I'm<00:03:11.620> going<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.769> be

a black flag shouldn't be working that
way<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.240> almost<00:05:14.229> always<00:05:14.650> start<00:05:15.099> with<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:15.250> dark

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
way I almost always start with a dark

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.629 
way I almost always start with a dark
color<00:05:15.789> on<00:05:16.349> lake<00:05:17.349> like<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.650> when<00:05:18.160> it's<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:18.460> I

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
color on lake like this when it's a so I

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.610 
color on lake like this when it's a so I
don't<00:05:18.669> know<00:05:18.880> why<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.060> should<00:05:19.360> have<00:05:19.570> it<00:05:19.780> but

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
don't know why I should have it but

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.070 
don't know why I should have it but
again<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.190> first<00:05:21.430> cast<00:05:21.729> I<00:05:22.000> made<00:05:22.240> up<00:05:22.570> into<00:05:22.960> that

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
almost every fish we've had I started we

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.120 
almost every fish we've had I started we
got<00:07:04.150> that<00:07:04.449> one<00:07:04.660> little<00:07:04.900> brownie<00:07:05.139> we've

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
got that one little brownie we've

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.219 
got that one little brownie we've
probably<00:07:06.400> had<00:07:06.639> eight<00:07:07.210> or<00:07:07.450> nine<00:07:07.600> other<00:07:07.930> fish

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
eating just just in this ten minutes it

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.129 
eating just just in this ten minutes it
took<00:07:11.500> us<00:07:11.680> to<00:07:11.800> walk<00:07:12.010> around<00:07:12.340> this<00:07:12.490> point<00:07:12.789> so<00:07:13.690> it

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
took us to walk around this point so it

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.050 
took us to walk around this point so it
tells<00:07:14.410> you<00:07:14.680> that<00:07:14.710> it's<00:07:14.979> really<00:07:15.190> not<00:07:15.310> that<00:07:15.760> tech

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
tells you that it's really not that tech

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.120 
tells you that it's really not that tech
it's<00:07:16.389> a<00:07:16.419> great<00:07:16.810> way<00:07:17.080> in<00:07:17.260> the<00:07:17.349> spring<00:07:17.740> to<00:07:17.950> show

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
it's a great way in the spring to show

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.450
