00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.319 

fortunately<00:03:52.979> it's<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.579> restricted<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
fortunately it's all restricted to the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.839 
fortunately it's all restricted to the
arms<00:03:54.769> once<00:03:55.769> you've<00:03:55.949> done<00:03:56.159> that<00:03:56.219> you<00:03:56.819> can

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
arms once you've done that you can

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.999 
arms once you've done that you can
transform<00:03:57.449> quite<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> bit<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.229> it<00:03:58.319> normally<00:03:58.799> and

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
transform quite a bit of it normally and

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.890 
transform quite a bit of it normally and
then<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.939> have<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.359> nice<00:04:00.659> little

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
then you have a nice little

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.740 
then you have a nice little
representation<00:04:01.439> of<00:04:01.919> hanky<00:04:02.250> convoy<00:04:02.750> the

representation of hanky convoy the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.780 
representation of hanky convoy the
proportions<00:04:04.319> are<00:04:04.439> good<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.250> head<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.430> just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
proportions are good the head is just

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.869 
proportions are good the head is just
right<00:04:06.030> size<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.500> only<00:04:07.739> problem<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.759> the

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
right size the only problem is that the

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.170 
right size the only problem is that the
elbow<00:04:09.299> articulation<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.259> restricted<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:12.000> can

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
elbow articulation is restricted you can

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.879 
elbow articulation is restricted you can
remove<00:04:12.419> these<00:04:12.629> parts<00:04:12.989> if<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.199> like<00:04:13.409> but<00:04:13.739> it's

the<00:04:29.790> other<00:04:31.070> lastly<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.250> star<00:04:32.639> saber<00:04:32.910> this

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
the other lastly we have star saber this

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.159 
the other lastly we have star saber this
kit<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.110> definitely<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.740> best<00:04:34.949> in<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.190> wave

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
kit is definitely the best in the wave

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.780 
kit is definitely the best in the wave
this<00:04:37.169> is<00:04:37.320> based<00:04:37.530> on<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> robot<00:04:38.130> masters<00:04:38.580> toy

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
this is based on the robot masters toy

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.760 
this is based on the robot masters toy
and<00:04:39.030> actually<00:04:39.720> looks<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.050> little<00:04:40.320> bit<00:04:40.530> better

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and actually looks a little bit better

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.620 
and actually looks a little bit better
thanks<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.520> blue<00:04:41.790> right<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.270> instead<00:04:42.570> of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
thanks to the blue right here instead of

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.560 
thanks to the blue right here instead of
the<00:04:42.780> red<00:04:43.400> red<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.430> more<00:04:44.729> accurate<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:45.240> robot

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
the red red is more accurate in robot

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.689 
the red red is more accurate in robot
mode<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.590> blue<00:04:46.770> makes<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.130> vehicle<00:04:47.520> mode

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
mode but the blue makes the vehicle mode

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.850 
mode but the blue makes the vehicle mode
a<00:04:47.729> bit<00:04:48.000> more<00:04:48.180> coherent<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.650> design

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
a bit more coherent and this design

00:04:49.860 --> 00:05:13.250 
a bit more coherent and this design
needs<00:04:50.250> all<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.910> help<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.270> can<00:04:51.330> get<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:13.050> only

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
needs all the help it can get the only

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.840 
needs all the help it can get the only
real<00:05:13.440> problem<00:05:13.650> with<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.010> kid<00:05:14.400> is<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.729> the

real problem with this kid is that the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.550 
real problem with this kid is that the
head<00:05:15.060> does<00:05:15.270> not<00:05:15.450> stay<00:05:15.660> in<00:05:15.690> place<00:05:16.020> at<00:05:16.229> all<00:05:16.350> oh

head does not stay in place at all oh
well<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.180> transformation<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.990> okay<00:05:19.350> most<00:05:20.220> of

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
well the transformation is okay most of

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.720 
well the transformation is okay most of
the<00:05:20.430> parts<00:05:20.729> fit<00:05:20.910> together<00:05:21.060> very<00:05:21.360> tightly

confirmed that wave fours victory Leo
will<00:05:35.880> combine<00:05:36.300> with<00:05:36.360> this<00:05:36.960> like<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.560> original

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
will combine with this like the original

will combine with this like the original
toys<00:05:38.220> but<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.150> don't<00:05:39.390> see<00:05:39.510> how<00:05:39.660> that's<00:05:39.840> supposed

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
toys but I don't see how that's supposed

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.380 
toys but I don't see how that's supposed
to<00:05:40.170> work<00:05:40.550> apparently<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.700> designers<00:05:42.180> thought

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
to work apparently the designers thought

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.330 
to work apparently the designers thought
of<00:05:42.540> something<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.020> didn't<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.740> always

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
of something I didn't I always

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.810 
of something I didn't I always
appreciate<00:05:44.880> when<00:05:45.060> they<00:05:45.180> could<00:05:45.300> do<00:05:45.420> that

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
appreciate when they could do that

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.790 
appreciate when they could do that
overall<00:05:47.820> this<00:05:47.970> is<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.150> good<00:05:48.420> first<00:05:48.630> wave<00:05:48.990> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
overall this is a good first wave the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.110 
overall this is a good first wave the
real<00:05:49.950> strength<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.400> these<00:05:50.550> kids<00:05:50.850> is<00:05:51.060> that

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
real strength of these kids is that

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.080 
real strength of these kids is that
they're<00:05:51.570> cheap<00:05:52.040> these<00:05:53.040> kits<00:05:53.310> display<00:05:53.700> nicely

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
they're cheap these kits display nicely

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.150 
they're cheap these kits display nicely
together<00:05:54.270> especially<00:05:54.810> when<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.470> have<00:05:55.710> some

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
together especially when you have some

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.520 
together especially when you have some
other<00:05:56.340> waves<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:56.940> go<00:05:57.090> with<00:05:57.300> I'm<00:05:58.080> glad<00:05:58.350> I've<00:05:58.500> got

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
other waves to go with I'm glad I've got

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.890 
other waves to go with I'm glad I've got
these
