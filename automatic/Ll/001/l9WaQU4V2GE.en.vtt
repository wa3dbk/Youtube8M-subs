canvas onto the wall itself so you don't

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
about the kind of paper I'm using to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
about the kind of paper I'm using to
create<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.650> painting<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.310> since<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:17.909> not

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
create this painting on since we're not

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.469 
create this painting on since we're not
using<00:01:18.210> canvas<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.320> using<00:01:19.790> polystyrene<00:01:20.790> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
using canvas I'm using polystyrene it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.190 
using canvas I'm using polystyrene it's
I<00:01:21.900> believe<00:01:21.930> 2<00:01:22.350> mil<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:24.659> plastic

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I believe 2 mil and it has some plastic

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
I believe 2 mil and it has some plastic
in<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.950> doesn't<00:01:26.280> buckle<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> put

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in it so it doesn't buckle when you put

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.210 
in it so it doesn't buckle when you put
paint<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> times<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
paint on to it a lot of times when you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.850 
paint on to it a lot of times when you
use<00:01:29.400> poster<00:01:29.850> paint<00:01:30.060> poster<00:01:30.600> board<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:31.590> sure

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
use poster paint poster board I'm sure

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
use poster paint poster board I'm sure
anybody<00:01:32.130> that's<00:01:32.400> painted<00:01:32.670> poster<00:01:33.000> board

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
anybody that's painted poster board

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.910 
anybody that's painted poster board
remembers<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> curls<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> gets

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
remembers how it curls up when it gets

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
remembers how it curls up when it gets
wet<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:36.030> plastic<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
wet because there's plastic in this it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
wet because there's plastic in this it
doesn't<00:01:37.680> roll

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
doesn't roll

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.950 
doesn't roll

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
lion that I saw and because I like to
work<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.299> place<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.930> isn't<00:01:52.259> reality<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
work from a place that isn't reality I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.300 
work from a place that isn't reality I
like<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:54.290> my<00:01:55.290> interpretation<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like it to be about my interpretation of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.209 
like it to be about my interpretation of
the<00:01:56.549> subject<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> sketched<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.530> put<00:01:59.100> in

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the subject when I sketched it I put in

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
the subject when I sketched it I put in
all<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> information<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> need<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.869> my

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
all the information that I need for my

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
all the information that I need for my
painting<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> use<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
painting so I don't want to use that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
painting so I don't want to use that
photo<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> reference<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> come

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
photo as a reference I want it to come

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.499 
photo as a reference I want it to come
from<00:02:04.920> somewhere<00:02:05.579> else<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.000> wanted<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> come

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
from somewhere else I wanted to come

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.979 
from somewhere else I wanted to come
from<00:02:06.659> memory<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> feeling<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.629> those<00:02:09.629> type

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
from memory and feeling and those type

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.500 
from memory and feeling and those type
of<00:02:10.020> things<00:02:10.200> not<00:02:10.649> an<00:02:10.950> actual<00:02:11.520> photograph<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
of things not an actual photograph of a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.320 
of things not an actual photograph of a
lion<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
lion so that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.570 
lion so that
why<00:02:13.510> I'm<00:02:13.660> not<00:02:13.870> using<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.620> photo<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.550> a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
why I'm not using a photo for a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.520 
why I'm not using a photo for a
reference<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.690> said<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.930> put<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.320> all

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
reference and like I said I put in all

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.590 
reference and like I said I put in all
of<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.830> darks<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.430> put<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.030> enough<00:02:19.300> information

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
of the darks I put in enough information

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.460 
of the darks I put in enough information
that<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.140> know<00:02:20.290> where<00:02:21.250> things<00:02:21.580> need<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.910> go<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.440> I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
that I know where things need to go so I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.590 
that I know where things need to go so I
don't<00:02:23.770> need<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> photographic<00:02:24.490> reference<00:02:25.060> so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
don't need a photographic reference so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.050 
don't need a photographic reference so
after<00:02:26.470> you're<00:02:26.590> finished<00:02:26.740> sketching<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.640> we

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
after you're finished sketching and we

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.430 
after you're finished sketching and we
have<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.330> affixed<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.810> board<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> next

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
have it affixed to the board the next

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.880 
have it affixed to the board the next
step<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.100> prepare<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:31.300> paper<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.440> our

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
step is to prepare your paper so our

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
step is to prepare your paper so our
next<00:02:33.220> step<00:02:33.580> will<00:02:33.880> be<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.090> lay<00:02:34.450> two<00:02:34.810> coats<00:02:35.110> of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
next step will be to lay two coats of

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.670 
next step will be to lay two coats of
gesso<00:02:35.910> clear<00:02:36.910> gesso<00:02:37.270> onto<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> surface<00:02:38.350> let

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
gesso clear gesso onto the surface let

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.740 
gesso clear gesso onto the surface let
it<00:02:38.800> dry<00:02:39.040> overnight<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:40.240> we're<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.600> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
it dry overnight and then we're going to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.580 
it dry overnight and then we're going to
paint<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.410> our<00:02:41.740> under<00:02:42.370> painting<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:44.140> watch<00:02:44.350> the
