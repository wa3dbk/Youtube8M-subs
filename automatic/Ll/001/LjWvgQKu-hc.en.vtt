00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
right after you're going to use that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.120

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
silver brown / rosy color right into i

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
silver brown / rosy color right into i
would<00:01:41.640> say<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.909> center<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> lid<00:01:42.780> without

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
would say like center of the lid without

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
would say like center of the lid without
applying<00:01:43.380> too<00:01:43.710> much<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> center<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
applying too much in the center it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.179 
applying too much in the center it's
like<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> transition<00:01:45.390> color<00:01:45.780> between<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.860> gray

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like a transition color between the gray

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
like a transition color between the gray
and<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> light<00:01:47.909> color<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.630> applying

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and the light color will be applying

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.990 
and the light color will be applying

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
might lose a little bit of intensity

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.050 
might lose a little bit of intensity
because<00:02:24.739> there's<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.099> much<00:02:25.250> blending<00:02:25.580> going

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
take an angle brush and I'm simply going

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.490 
take an angle brush and I'm simply going
to<00:02:46.220> kind<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.670> diffuse<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.599> harsh<00:02:47.900> line<00:02:48.260> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to kind of diffuse that harsh line I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.400 
to kind of diffuse that harsh line I
want<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.129> be<00:02:49.310> more<00:02:49.640> smoky<00:02:50.269> than<00:02:50.569> sharp<00:02:51.049> and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
want it to be more smoky than sharp and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.069 
want it to be more smoky than sharp and
I'm<00:02:51.829> also<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> use<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.000> M<00:02:53.180> hundred

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
I'm also going to use the M hundred

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.650 
I'm also going to use the M hundred
which<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> matte<00:02:54.799> black<00:02:55.489> eyeshadow<00:02:55.700> now

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
which is a matte black eyeshadow now

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.300 
which is a matte black eyeshadow now
this<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> must<00:02:57.290> for<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:57.680> look<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
this is a must for this look because the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.610 
this is a must for this look because the
gray<00:02:58.519> wasn't<00:02:58.849> dark<00:02:59.030> enough<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.170> I'm<00:03:00.440> just

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
gray wasn't dark enough so I'm just

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.339 
gray wasn't dark enough so I'm just
applying<00:03:00.829> that<00:03:01.099> right<00:03:01.430> on<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.660> artist<00:03:03.079> liner

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
applying that right on the artist liner

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.220 
applying that right on the artist liner
and<00:03:03.650> i'm<00:03:03.769> slowly<00:03:04.010> blending<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:06.110> you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and i'm slowly blending up and as you

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.930 
and i'm slowly blending up and as you
can<00:03:06.379> see<00:03:06.410> i'm<00:03:06.680> mostly<00:03:06.950> using<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.400> black

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
can see i'm mostly using that black

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.300 
can see i'm mostly using that black
eyeshadow<00:03:08.180> on<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.440> inner<00:03:09.680> corners<00:03:10.129> and
