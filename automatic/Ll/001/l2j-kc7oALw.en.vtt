00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
comeback was not on because i think of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
comeback was not on because i think of
the<00:01:45.930> 89th<00:01:46.290> may<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:47.070> responded<00:01:47.430> straight

the 89th may go he responded straight
wave<00:01:47.790> across<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> unfortunately<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.500> now

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
wave across and unfortunately we are now

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.550 
wave across and unfortunately we are now
doing<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.390> if<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.659> lose<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
doing it and if we lose we don't get the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.749 
doing it and if we lose we don't get the
coins<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.159> could<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.610> bit

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
coins so it could take a little bit

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
coins so it could take a little bit
longer<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> players<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> also<00:01:55.409> one

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
longer to get the players and also one

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.200 
longer to get the players and also one

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
and it's something I can't even stop

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.540 
and it's something I can't even stop
because<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.110> defendant<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.650> like<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.130> want

that born it just chased it even though
it<00:02:33.080> wasn't<00:02:33.230> there<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.220> are<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.550> no<00:02:34.700> down

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
it wasn't there so we are one no down

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.820 
it wasn't there so we are one no down
and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:35.870> microcell<00:02:36.350> goes<00:02:36.500> through

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
and then microcell goes through

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.220 
and then microcell goes through

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
from the final squad and so if you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.920 
from the final squad and so if you
didn't<00:03:16.730> know<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:16.820> I'd<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.600> now<00:03:17.780> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
didn't know that I'd do that now and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.930 
didn't know that I'd do that now and
also<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.680> said<00:03:19.040> before<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.489> lose<00:03:19.700> I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
also like I said before if I lose I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.090 
also like I said before if I lose I
combine<00:03:20.420> Italian<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.320> one<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.680> not<00:03:21.980> in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
combine Italian but one that is not in

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.290 
combine Italian but one that is not in
this<00:03:22.190> squad<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.850> means<00:03:23.030> I've<00:03:23.120> got<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
this squad so that means I've got a

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.330 
this squad so that means I've got a
little<00:03:23.390> bit<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.570> depth<00:03:23.810> other<00:03:24.680> than<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.280> course

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
little bit of depth other than of course

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.979 
little bit of depth other than of course
the<00:03:25.760> players<00:03:25.970> don't<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.330> using<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> end<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
the players don't be using at the end so

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.460 
the players don't be using at the end so
i<00:03:27.230> think<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> bit<00:03:27.950> more<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.200> also<00:03:30.200> cutting

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
i think is a bit more and also cutting

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.510 
i think is a bit more and also cutting
edge<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.860> serious<00:03:31.160> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.400> thing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
edge to the serious kind of thing
