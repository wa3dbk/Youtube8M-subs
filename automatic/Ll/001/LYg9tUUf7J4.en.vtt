 The piece 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.630
 Forgetting, I 'm thinking. 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.630
 it's yours 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.770

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.340

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.780
 Thinking of you is 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 Thinking of you, I 'm thinking of 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.780
 you 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.330
 to play the first part we will go 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.330
 use these chords here the biggest sun 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.930
 only with a fifth increased in my minor 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.200
 there seventh 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.159
 there minor with seventh 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.689
 I was wrong with 7 smaller ones that we will 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.670
 use the index finger touching here 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.829
 very light on the neighboring rope to drown 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.379
 the sound as the string should not only 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:04:00.189
 while we play 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:04:00.189
 so the first part stays like this 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:14.120
 Think and forget when I think of you. 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:20.539
 It's when I do not feel myself alone. 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:23.010
 lyrics and sounds of the win 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:28.020
 I find a tour 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.670
 in the usa the drawing late do everything with 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.670
 you feel me 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.639
 As I said at the beginning of the lesson, the people 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.340
 will use a rhythm just to play the song 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.199
 whole I'll play a rhythm once 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.530
 wagah and then shows how it is 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.530
 that makes 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.870
 once again 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.350
 Good, we start by telling you the sun. 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.980
 bigger and touches one down 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:09.170
 then we play down and up 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.170
 down and up 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.440
 O 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.030
 soon this is the rhythm that we will 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.920
 use to play music all in 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.140
 cut of the song will be played once 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.300
 I'll join the chords of the first 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.530
 part and play a part of the rhythm to the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.530
 Can you train with me? 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.009
 with this chord sequence is played 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.690
 in the first stanza 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.289
 after that just repeat the same 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.330
 sequence in the second stanza in the 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.280
 rhythm is exactly the same as I just 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.440
 teach and it will continue being touched 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.639
 once in each chord the chords that the 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.100
 people will use to play chorus are 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.100
 these here the greatest sun 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:31.509
 a seventh I minor minor with seven in 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:37.889
 low and straight there with 7 million low in 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:37.889

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.110
 and it's bigger 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:53.169
 Look, only I 'm thinking of you. 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.169

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:04.030
 Forget you, I'm thinking. 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.030

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.310
 to forget 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.010
 At the end of the song we're going to stay. 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.200
 repeating a verse the rhythm of chords 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.370
 are the same ones I taught and in the last 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.960
 Wake up to finish the music to us. 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:25.620

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:25.620
