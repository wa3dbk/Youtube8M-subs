00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:14.030
 and most of all the first question that 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.920
 we can consider is where 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.530
 we must begin that it would be for me what 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.840
 ideal, because more than anything, open the 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.120
 ham in its entirety and be able to give 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.200
 slices of the various parts of the 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.960
 product has four different flavors 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.789
 four different aromas within one 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 same piece for family consumption 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.320
 always the ideal is to start it by the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.969
 part of the club 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.399
 let's make the cut and for that 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.420
 We will use a series of tools 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.760
 undoubtedly I believe that it is the great 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 friend of a good cutter us to the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.480
 Cutting time we need three 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.460
 knives one of them exclusively 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.949
 for what is the other small bark 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.589
 to mark and finally the typical 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.750
 ham knife that is flexible for 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.309
 be able to access all the bone and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.070
 make the product the best 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.070
 possible we will take what is the knife 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.979
 of the spot and like that and we'll make a small 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.390
 incision two fingers above this 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.390
 small bone well 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.830
 As you can see, we will protect the product 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 at the same time that we are consuming another 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.120
 important factor when it comes to taste 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.840
 this product in conditions is the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.880
 temperature we have 2 temperatures one 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.280
 the conservation of the product when 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 it will not be consumed 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.299
 that it would be from 14 to 18 degrees and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.729
 another consumption temperature that yes 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 that it is very important that he would be in 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 around 20 to 24 because it's going to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.650
 enhance the sensation to electric organ 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.980
 of the product 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.900
 as you see we are doing a cleaning 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.530
 exhaustive but only from the area that 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.530
 we are going to consume 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.710
 We will be discarding the first slices 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.470
 which are the ones with more fat 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.930
 for once finished what is the cut 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.850
 happen so that the next day it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.820
 find in the best conditions of 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.830
 consumption as you see we do not do any 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.850
 strength is simply to slide 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.010
 the knife on the product for me 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.900
 this would be a very thin ideal slice 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.890
 translucent 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 let him enjoy 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.370
 the truth that gives a wonderful aroma and 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 with this little slice we can 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.799
 enjoy a good 5 jacks we can see 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.310
 when we press the fat as it melts 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.409
 which easily give you quality note 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.440
 now let's use the knife 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.560
 small that we call lace for 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.709
 mark with mark is to separate the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.650
 bone area of lean to take advantage of 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.159
 much more what is the product that 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.890
 we get with this marking of the del 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.739
 ham more than anything that armin milestone when 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.139
 let's use the ham knife and we 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.760
 get to the bone area the edge of 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.549
 knife does not touch the bone and we 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.049
 keeps for longer and the second 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.599
 purpose and more important is the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.630
 leveraging the optimization of all 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.880
 this area that is stuck to the bone 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.520
 as you can see when cutting the credit 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.340
 marked with the small knife at 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.599
 get the slice in the bone area jumps 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.580
 the knife does not touch the bone and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 we are much easier to cut 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.599
 this ham 5j 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 we repeat what we did to the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.250
 home that is to clean up everything 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.019
 it's outer bark , the same thing we'll do for 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.200
 this side we will incite what is the tip 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:01.190
 of the knife and we will protect the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.970
 Once we are moving forward in consumption 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.950
 because we make this little channel what 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.660
 we do for two purposes the first 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.030
 is for aesthetics and the second and more 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.670
 important is because it is losing fat 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.459
 and lipids are sweating the product and the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.889
 fat is deposited in this area 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.280
 When you arrive, your bridge will return to 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.280
 take 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.680
 the knife called lace for 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.470
 keep checking what will facilitate us 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.940
 much the work of what is the cut and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 product optimization 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.440
 well once we have arrived 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.880
 to the area or if it is here as you see 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.790
 we touch bones in several parts now 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.260
 we will try to take advantage of all sides 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.510
 of what the club is by putting the 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.750
 knife in a visioned way to 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.650
 monetize and take advantage of the product 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.650
 everything you can 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.390
 we will protect the area of ​​the contra 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.060
 mace 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.409
 once we have cleaned the whole part 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.179
 external we are going to remove little bones 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.059
 what would correspond to the 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:15.159
 meniscus of the knee first 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:17.409
 we locate second we follow the 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.220
 trajectory or towards the femur and now 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.200
 a twist of dolls 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.150
 to put what is the knife in this 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.900
 position now next what 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.490
 we do it's lever we perform strength 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.150
 because if we relate force is that 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.600
 We are doing the wrong operation 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.000
 is to change and pry 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.729
 well then once removed what is this 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.439
 little bones 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.749
 our work will be much easier 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.219
 we can cut much more comfortable and about 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.880
 everything will not come out what is typical 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.750
 camber 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.320
 that does not usually leave everyone in this area 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.300
 once we have advanced the cut 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.500
 we go back to take the small knife and 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.700
 we just dial again is 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.930
 pull apart 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.199
 the bony area 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.370
 of the ham to facilitate the work 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:16.150
 and optimize the product more 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.990
 now when we continue cutting the slice 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.540
 it comes off easily 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.030
 with which our work is done a lot 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.190
 more enjoyable as you see in this area has 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.110
 a lot less leaks and we call 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.350
 leaks to fat between 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.740
 muscle packs but it's likewise 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.540
 a very appetizing area finally since 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.580
 this ham is coming to an end and what 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.070
 we will do will be to take advantage and 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.550
 make the reel area profitable for me 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:48.310
 that I believe is the unknown area and that 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.980
 everyone does not take advantage we have 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.530
 the ham a little beveled a little bit 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.160
 tilted so that the slices do not come out 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:01.030
 much wider is an area that has 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.729
 sensations in the mouth lasts a lot 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.939
 what is the taste 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:07.999
 but as you see, we lean a little bit 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:11.599
 what is the ham comes out sliced 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:11.599
 totally appetizing 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.319
 the last part and let's take out is going to be 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.999
 the reel area as you see we are going to 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.489
 take out this little hue was quoted for it 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:22.049
 we use what is the lace this 

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:24.600
 tiny knife and now what 

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:27.000
 you do is simply u 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.420
 this area that we can well slice or 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.420
 well we can make taquitos with this 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.370
 we will have 

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.060
 cut the different parts of the 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:41.530
 product optimizing by making this 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.530
 five drops to the maximum 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.270
 if we join purity of race feeding of 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.290
 acorn the knowledge of making a village 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:55.330
 jabugo we get a 5j ham that is a 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.330
 true Spanish national treasure 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.580
 av
