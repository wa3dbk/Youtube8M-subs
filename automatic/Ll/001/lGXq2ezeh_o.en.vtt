00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.310
 the probe 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.359
 and also 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.410
 had conversations 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.900

 anticipated when branch used the meteor 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360
 Nando 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 the short distance after advertisement and the mark

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.290
 mariana ohata january 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.200
 However 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 hence also 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 every year 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160
 what 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.960
 a mission without account and also 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320
 considered that with the other pilots 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 they are doing 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.520
 what takes the player 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.670
 of votes 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 program which also promotes the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.450
 fathi controller 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.270
 I said something 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.370
 we ride 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.910
 Porto Velho 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 amanda per billion and that they appear 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 and also on the floor 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.450
 I skipped an army 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 wants to show one thing what it is to lose what it is that we are seeing 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.450
 we can also send 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 everything changes too 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 another that also personal 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 controversial elections to ration 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.250
 neca 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.250
 if your students big mistake 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.379
 andrew cuomo 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.929
 ef 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.929
 also in a sea of ​​fat hill 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.309
 the shirt 9 also of small world and paulo even 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
 but it was good too but already gone 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.959
 future will be more refused 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.009
 and it's good too 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.480
 is to see how these 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.999
 health services 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.249
 this year are 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.249
 with a little 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.769
 renata we use 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.539
 the lessons we can take 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.459
 do all three of these tests 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.149
 on the same flight 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.679
 this guy this year 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.819
 how come 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.109
 we can also 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.430
 the moment passes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.430
 the action 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.439
 Carlos 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.349
 in the morning 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 the worst rugby meteorite month in thesis yes we can think 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.669
 a worse scenario 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.340
 and when we got to the place 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.699
 our strong point 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699
 I want to stay 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.769
 m 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.059
 health orms 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.279
 and also because later on, 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.819
 it was robbed 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.879
 on the pumps 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.629
 Let's assume that by pure 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.469
 then through touch man percent 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.749
 send back 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.889
 he got arrested on the spot the commander 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.679
 this is the result 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.569
 and right now 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.900
 Harry Potter 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.169
 with seven 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.449
 and then 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.459
 he continues with the worst call me cut 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:57.959
 composed of pants make 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.959
 was balanced because it continues to 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.649
 razed 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.849
 what it takes 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.889
 by the tradition to be great among friends of josé serra the charming 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 in what is the suez 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.639
 in the so-called game 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.809
 change 15 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.039
 be developed here in sweden 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.039
 It's also thinking of the floor. 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 so the other three were in sweden 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.259
 luxury instrument 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.530
 but right now we have a profile with the sound message 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.590
 with the capacity 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.590
 at least with the card the only goal 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.159
 about the capacity 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.159
 in shark 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.759
 the weapon for a room 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.759
 for example right 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.180
 motivate website 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.289
 best 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.289
 so I can not do this 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.559
 Let's prove we are 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.779
 on the agenda 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.479
 percent approved 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.479
 on account of surgery 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.409
 2x0 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.409
 the Dutch state 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.909
 is at 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.639
 how come 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.089
 now 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.960
 all for 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.289
 2 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.289
 but there were very few to declare 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.080
 antenna 1 to 1 and it 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.059
 in general 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.639
 was a liar 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.110
 but two generating 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.219
 the dry season 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.740
 Sao Paulo 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.740
 for example a naval mission 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.529
 How is it this year? 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.979
 when he was quoted and also after 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.960
 to change 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.379
 and me doing pipi ormaechea 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.379
 which forces us to rethink what is now occupied by one of the fans 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.159
 what for us 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.159
 The affair is serious. 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.369
 nineteenth century 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:30.249
 a form 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:33.249
 implanted 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:35.529
 it's no longer fiction 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.580
 they are not the one to say one thing 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.219
 after using a dictator 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.219
 but very below 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.930
 all this 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.879
 I will not let go 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.099
 I do not need to say 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.099
 with the worst month to come back 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.249
 the rp representation 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:01.619
 created to sew after 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.619
 to make an action swept 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:07.599
 is the answer to everything 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:08.779
 a solo flight 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.219
 absolute success and then come back
