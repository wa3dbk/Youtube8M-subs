Hi! This chaff . I did it myself .

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:27.100

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:37.100
That is - a base made ​​of an iron bracket.
It is worth the engine (3 kilowatt ) . Capacitors are connected to the motor to start the engine.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:58.800

That disc which is mounted on the motor shaft . The disk blades are soldered to create an air flow.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:35.700

is made of metal chaff 2 mm.

Disk made ​​of metal of a thickness not less than 3 mm. ( that in operation it is not bent ).

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:58.300

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:40.200
