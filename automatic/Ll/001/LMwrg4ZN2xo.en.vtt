the<00:00:24.060> dashboard<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.310> finished

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.350 

so<00:00:29.429> I've<00:00:29.580> made<00:00:29.789> some<00:00:30.029> good<00:00:30.300> progress<00:00:32.360> there's

so I've made some good progress there's
not<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:33.960> tell<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.800> not

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
not much I can tell you about it not

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
not much I can tell you about it not
much<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.149> show<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> other<00:00:37.440> than<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.949> fact

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
much I can show you other than the fact

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.710 
much I can show you other than the fact
that<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.989> looking<00:00:39.989> good<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> should

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.860 

so<00:00:45.720> that's<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:47.420> nothing<00:00:48.420> too<00:00:48.570> special

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so that's it really nothing too special

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.369 
so that's it really nothing too special
about<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:49.280> make<00:00:50.280> sure<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.970> your<00:00:51.379> wiring

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
about it make sure you get your wiring

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.990 
about it make sure you get your wiring
done<00:00:52.949> inside<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.699> dashboard<00:00:54.739> before<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
done inside your dashboard before you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.700 
done inside your dashboard before you
fix<00:00:57.000> everything<00:00:57.329> back<00:00:57.659> in<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.050> and<00:01:00.710> make

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
fix everything back in place and make

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.450 
fix everything back in place and make
sure<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> had<00:01:02.519> leave<00:01:02.730> enough<00:01:03.030> space<00:01:03.210> for

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
sure that you had leave enough space for

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.499 
sure that you had leave enough space for
the<00:01:05.460> radio<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.789> fit<00:01:06.149> because<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:08.390> put<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
the radio to fit because if you put the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.930 
the radio to fit because if you put the
wiring<00:01:09.929> loom<00:01:09.960> too<00:01:10.440> far<00:01:10.710> forward<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
wiring loom too far forward you're a

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.870 
wiring loom too far forward you're a
radio<00:01:12.330> won't<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> take<00:01:16.470> notice<00:01:16.710> there

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.400

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
and for the rest it's it's all

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.210 
and for the rest it's it's all
straightforward<00:01:24.649> just<00:01:25.649> plug<00:01:25.950> everything

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
straightforward just plug everything

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
straightforward just plug everything
back<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.990> screw<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> back<00:01:28.229> together
