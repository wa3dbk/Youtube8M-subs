00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.190
 and as the girls all want a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.800
 Wasp waist defined we walk 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.790
 Always asking always in the post office 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 electronic through facebook 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.040
 through the website exercises for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.650
 who help the fathers who are 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.169
 they form around the waist and that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 work has to be an ant 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.899
 you have to always work all the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.210
 days the oblique and waist area 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.519
 but it's not just training 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.989
 here we present it to you obviously in 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.930
 the program with different alternatives 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.019
 it is also about having a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.539
 always healthy eating to be 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.679
 strict with ourselves to know 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.410
 that all they are sweet hens 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.109
 sugars will always work 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.629
 always around that area of 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.609
 navel and it will swell the tummy 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 and we're not going to like how we see each other 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.500
 then all that are sweet 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.100
 all the junk food will share 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.380
 always always in this great appointment that goes 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.600
 to cover the abdominal area and obviously 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 it's not going to let us see ourselves as 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.720
 managers I have to spread ten discipline 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.960
 always always in your diet and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.649
 do these exercises today I'm going to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.579
 teach to do exercises with the ball 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.610
 but all focused on the abdominal area 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.659
 oblique waist then we go to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.909
 stand with our legs apart and the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.789
 knees are unlocked we do not 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.869
 we stop so straight but rather 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.939
 rested we catch the ball with 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.310
 firmness that this big ball can be 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.679
 or it can be a tiny ball too 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.759
 palm of the open hand and what we're going 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:59.549
 to do is give turns but these turns 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.959
 they are with energy you will not do it 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.320
 slowly you do not go, it's the quickie and 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.300
 really feeling 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.600
 I work in the abdominal area but you have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.910
 that put that very good hard abdomen 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.050
 active we do about 30 repetitions 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.190
 complementary to this I will involve 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.530
 him this moment here when I go with the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 ball down up to the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.790
 raise your arms I am also 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.500
 activating the abdominal area because at 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.770
 stretch the arms active the abdomen 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.650
 going up and in passing I make a 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.470
 squat 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.020
 manages breathing well 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.360
 going down and up and going up to that and the acre 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.190
 pto 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 perfect another combination that I give you 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.680
 we are always with the ball I know that if 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.519
 there is one at home take advantage of the classroom 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.940
 little girl does not matter we are going now to 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.569
 do it cross way I have the ball 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.880
 up here and what I do is 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.360
 down and up 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.030
 only from one side trying to 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.970
 take it 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.600
 towards the floor 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.940
 I touch and up only one side 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.049
 first exhale and do your 20 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.510
 repetitions 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.670
 and we're not going to do it on the other side 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 this ball here 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:44.590
 and it gives to one side and the other 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 inclined the wave to the opposite side 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.020
 the right back 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.610
 and that is 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.610
 that is handled by the breath 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.150
 let's do two more 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.110
 and the last great as you'll see I have 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.150
 several alternatives here of exercise 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.710
 with the ball that will help you 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.250
 develop what you want or be 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.790
 have a firm abdomen and especially the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.660
 waist marked now as last 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.400
 alternative we could add it again 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.880
 I'm going sitting yes 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.270
 and we are going to place our hands in this 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.370
 position shoulders back you separate a 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.370
 little legs and we go turns towards 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.770
 sides 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.990
 with this last 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:52.650
 we would be finishing this segment of 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.320
 exercises for waist indicated and now 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.590
 we do not do 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.520
 simply taking the arms to 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.270
 above 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.270
 all right
