doesn't<00:01:50.999> seem<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.569> issue<00:01:51.719> when<00:01:52.289> it

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
doesn't seem to have an issue when it

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.940 
doesn't seem to have an issue when it
comes<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.920> scripting<00:01:53.639> and<00:01:53.880> GTA<00:01:54.539> mods<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
comes to scripting and GTA mods in the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
comes to scripting and GTA mods in the
PC<00:01:56.310> versions<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.389> an<00:01:57.509> issue

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
PC versions but they do have an issue

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
PC versions but they do have an issue
with<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> consoles<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.399> assuming<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.850> has

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
with the consoles so I'm assuming it has

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
with the consoles so I'm assuming it has
to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.179> with<00:02:00.359> something<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> agreement

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to do with something with the agreement

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.199 
to do with something with the agreement
between<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.859> know<00:02:02.009> Microsoft<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.789> rockstar

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
between you know Microsoft and rockstar

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.169 
between you know Microsoft and rockstar
so<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:04.380> guessing<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.920> probably<00:02:05.459> one<00:02:06.149> of

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
so I'm guessing that's probably one of

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.779 
so I'm guessing that's probably one of
the<00:02:06.329> reasons<00:02:06.359> why<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.229> nevertheless<00:02:08.160> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the reasons why but nevertheless this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.840 
the reasons why but nevertheless this
