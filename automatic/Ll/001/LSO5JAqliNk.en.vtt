00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
think I mean it's something that we've

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.229 
think I mean it's something that we've
worked<00:03:15.019> on<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.709> after<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.010> last<00:03:16.220> year<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.180> a

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
worked on and after the last year and a

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.840 
worked on and after the last year and a
half<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.420> when<00:03:17.810> we<00:03:17.900> we've<00:03:18.260> known<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.850> that's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
half now when we we've known that that's

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.120 
half now when we we've known that that's
going<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.269> how<00:03:20.600> this<00:03:21.019> games<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.530> decided<00:03:21.860> at

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
going to be how this games I decided at

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.890

the<00:03:22.220> Olympic<00:03:22.489> Games<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.420> mean<00:03:23.780> we've

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
the Olympic Games so I mean we've

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.479 
the Olympic Games so I mean we've
trained<00:03:24.140> for<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.440> mean<00:03:24.590> normally<00:03:25.160> at

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
trained for that I mean normally at

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.670 
trained for that I mean normally at
training<00:03:25.940> we<00:03:26.000> can<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.299> in<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> 20<00:03:26.870> or<00:03:26.900> 30<00:03:27.140> la<00:03:27.500> so

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
training we can do in the 20 or 30 la so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.840 
training we can do in the 20 or 30 la so
doing<00:03:27.920> five<00:03:28.070> at<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.280> end<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.489> game<00:03:28.670> is<00:03:28.820> not

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
doing five at the end of the game is not

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.740 
doing five at the end of the game is not
too<00:03:29.060> much<00:03:29.239> trouble

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
too much trouble

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.190 
too much trouble
so<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.650> keeper<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.489> mental<00:03:32.200> ability

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
so for a keeper you the mental ability

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.560 
so for a keeper you the mental ability
to<00:03:33.320> stay<00:03:33.560> tuned<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.340> game<00:03:34.580> for<00:03:35.090> after

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
to stay tuned in to that game for after

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.520 
to stay tuned in to that game for after
the<00:03:35.660> final<00:03:35.989> whistle<00:03:36.110> yeah<00:03:37.100> well<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.760> mean<00:03:38.530> I

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
the final whistle yeah well I mean I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.319 
the final whistle yeah well I mean I
think<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.519> can<00:03:40.640> always<00:03:40.760> get<00:03:41.000> up<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.239> those

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
think you can always get up for those

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.090 
think you can always get up for those
one-on-ones<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.260> our<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.709> guess<00:03:42.980> our

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
one-on-ones because it's our I guess our

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.870 
one-on-ones because it's our I guess our
time<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.489> shine<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:45.140> yeah<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.010> think<00:03:46.160> I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
time to shine and and yeah I think I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.490 
time to shine and and yeah I think I
mean<00:03:47.209> hopefully<00:03:47.600> at<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.049> Olympics<00:03:48.320> we<00:03:48.380> might

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
mean hopefully at the Olympics we might

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.190 
mean hopefully at the Olympics we might
come

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
come

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.900 
come
down<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.770> I'm<00:03:49.890> quite<00:03:50.340> confident<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.790> we

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
down to but I'm quite confident that we

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.670 
down to but I'm quite confident that we
get<00:03:51.060> down<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.450> situation<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.260> I'm<00:03:52.379> well

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
get down to that situation that I'm well

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.130 
get down to that situation that I'm well
prepared<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.670> what<00:03:54.120> do<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.420> what

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
prepared for it so what do you do what

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
prepared for it so what do you do what
process<00:03:55.500> do<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.620> go<00:03:55.680> through<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.010> got<00:03:56.129> a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
process do you go through you got a

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.589 
process do you go through you got a
bloke<00:03:56.340> twenty-five<00:03:56.760> meters<00:03:57.060> away<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.420> one

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
bloke twenty-five meters away with one

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.850 
bloke twenty-five meters away with one
hockey<00:03:57.810> ball<00:03:58.050> you're<00:03:58.319> in<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> back<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.800> the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
hockey ball you're in the back of the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.670 
hockey ball you're in the back of the
net<00:03:59.069> headless<00:03:59.459> top<00:03:59.670> well<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.269> think<00:04:00.470> one<00:04:01.470> thing

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
net headless top well I think one thing

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.380 
net headless top well I think one thing
on<00:04:01.769> our<00:04:01.800> side<00:04:01.920> there's<00:04:02.550> an<00:04:02.700> 8<00:04:02.819> second<00:04:03.209> time

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
on our side there's an 8 second time

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.350 
on our side there's an 8 second time
limit<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.769> think<00:04:05.160> our<00:04:05.489> thought<00:04:05.730> process<00:04:06.180> is

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
limit so I think our thought process is

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.000 
limit so I think our thought process is
to<00:04:06.480> try<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.050> put<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.319> pressure<00:04:07.470> back<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
to try and put the pressure back on the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.979 
to try and put the pressure back on the
strikers<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.550> try<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.880> score<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.450> hold<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
strikers to try and score and hold the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.509 
strikers to try and score and hold the
man<00:04:10.140> as<00:04:10.260> long<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.530> we<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.800> if<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.040> do<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.370> then

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
man as long as we can if we do that then

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.280 
man as long as we can if we do that then
we've<00:04:11.640> cheaped<00:04:11.880> our<00:04:12.030> goal<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.480> eventually<00:04:13.170> at

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
we've cheaped our goal and eventually at

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.420 
we've cheaped our goal and eventually at
some<00:04:13.470> point<00:04:13.709> they're<00:04:13.830> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> make<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.130> shot

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
some point they're going to make a shot

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.470 
some point they're going to make a shot
and<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.700> want<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.150> best<00:04:15.330> possible
