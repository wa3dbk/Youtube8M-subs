00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 true that very well by surprise has already happened 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.649
 all the pains that I had to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.440
 normal after an operation of a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.150
 knee and good now more than anything 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 I was training here several 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 days with the companions 100% and good 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 It was also normal that until 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 be 100% sure I did not want to risk 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.000
 nothing good I feel 100% and I knew that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.250
 if it came in, the risk could be worse 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 for the future and I was also aware 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 that he did not need to risk 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.610
 both knowing that the anxiety in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 you want to go in he had almost was like 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 I said I wanted to go in alone and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.430
 put me to play because I wanted to help from 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 whatever the teammates but good 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 then in cold you realize that it was 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.940
 better because I could have played 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.100
 a bad trick not because now I had more 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 days to recover and be better I do not know 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.340
 if he will play in conditions I am today 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 this day and I'm training the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 part of the team and good I feel in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.149
 good conditions obviously that the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.629
 joy he wins he never went to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.949
 lose in no time I thought about that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.750
 it happened to me about the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.430
 the lesson in no time I thought that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.020
 I was going to lose world that was 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.560
 completely confident, trust in the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.149
 doctors in what they told me 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 treatment that had me caserito by 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.289
 that was also calm and the rival 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.299
 the whole world is the class of rival that 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.189
 is how important it means to me 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.350
 this match and good more than anything 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 for all that, everyone knows what he saw 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.649
 the other day what is england of what 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.299
 I already think he played a lot better than 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.030
 Italy and had no luck at the time of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.189
 finish the play but it has 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.929
 world class players that is in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.439
 the premier that they are doing it very 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.360
 good level I know everyone I know 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.569
 by all of them I played with some 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.220
 games in the same club and well no 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.349
 happens that the world cup matches are 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 they are difficult inside the court they are 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.039
 11 against 11 of them there were 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.369
 always and you never know what can happen 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.679
 and no one's favorites anymore we no longer have 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.569
 that we have to be careful of what 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.569
 that not what we saw the other day
