00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 and I decided to study this master for 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.260
 acquire greater managerial skills 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.180
 in my daily activity 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.270
 I have to sometimes take a series of 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.430
 decisions that the master's program and 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.580
 it seemed very complementary to what 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.650
 I do professionally every day and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.570
 because I also think that a professional 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.090
 must be continuously adapting 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 it has to be recycling and that is 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.649
 very important permanent education 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.340
 the health benefits official master is 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.230
 focus on what is a recognized title to 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.580
 European level first and foremost 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.620
 second place that offers the possibility 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.180
 to the students that make this master 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.040
 official to access studies 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.080
 afterwards if you intend to make a 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.170
 doctoral thesis for me the methodology 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.700
 online about everything that facilitates me is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.500
 flexibility allows me to make compatible 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.710
 my work with study time 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.770
 it also lets me, above all, self-manage 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.020
 me then on the other hand good also the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.910
 mobility because I do not need the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.860

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.060
 things and makes everything very much 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 more versatile

 approach of the student through that 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.780
