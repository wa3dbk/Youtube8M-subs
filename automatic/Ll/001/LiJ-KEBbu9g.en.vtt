00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
my sixth year as my B PhD soon here at

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.049 
my sixth year as my B PhD soon here at
Mount<00:00:13.330> Sinai<00:00:13.420> it's<00:00:13.930> been<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:15.460> been<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:15.730> long

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
Mount Sinai it's been it's been a long

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.089 
Mount Sinai it's been it's been a long
time<00:00:16.330> but<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.630> really<00:00:17.290> good<00:00:17.470> journey<00:00:17.860> so<00:00:18.070> far

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
time but a really good journey so far

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.800 
time but a really good journey so far
and<00:00:18.400> I'm<00:00:18.640> looking<00:00:18.910> forward<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.390> next<00:00:19.540> few

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
and I'm looking forward to the next few

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.769 
and I'm looking forward to the next few
years<00:00:19.869> as<00:00:20.169> well<00:00:20.700> before<00:00:21.700> coming<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.029> Sinai<00:00:22.539> I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
years as well before coming to Sinai I

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.909 
years as well before coming to Sinai I
grew<00:00:23.710> up<00:00:23.770> in<00:00:23.950> canada<00:00:24.460> in<00:00:24.669> toronto<00:00:24.880> canada<00:00:25.919> but

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
grew up in canada in toronto canada but

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.249 
grew up in canada in toronto canada but
a<00:00:27.130> little<00:00:27.610> too<00:00:27.640> cold<00:00:28.059> there<00:00:28.450> are<00:00:28.599> one

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
a little too cold there are one

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.499 
a little too cold there are one
committee<00:00:29.590> polar<00:00:29.860> bear<00:00:30.070> attacks<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.759> so

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
committee polar bear attacks and so

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.209 
committee polar bear attacks and so
after<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.230> I<00:00:32.439> have<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.739> come<00:00:32.950> South<00:00:33.190> a

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
after that is I have to come South a

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.790 
after that is I have to come South a
little<00:00:33.370> bit<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.880> that<00:00:34.360> going<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.660> college<00:00:34.989> in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
little bit and that going to college in

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.580 
little bit and that going to college in
the<00:00:35.890> States<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.910> went<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.600> Princeton<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.290> I

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
the States I went to Princeton and I

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.500 
the States I went to Princeton and I
studied<00:00:39.129> molecular<00:00:39.580> biology<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.420> computer

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
studied molecular biology and computer

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.450 
studied molecular biology and computer
science<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.500> always<00:00:41.830> have<00:00:42.040> an<00:00:42.130> interest

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
science and I always have an interest

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.000 
science and I always have an interest
both<00:00:42.730> in<00:00:43.000> surf<00:00:43.570> island<00:00:43.840> biology<00:00:44.560> computer

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
both in surf island biology computer

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.460 
both in surf island biology computer
science<00:00:45.490> I<00:00:45.790> really<00:00:46.690> want<00:00:46.870> to<00:00:47.050> get<00:00:47.350> involved

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
science I really want to get involved

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.220 
science I really want to get involved
with<00:00:47.740> medicines<00:00:48.250> somehow<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.870> just

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
with medicines somehow and so I just

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.530 
with medicines somehow and so I just
around<00:00:50.440> my<00:00:50.560> sophomore<00:00:51.040> year<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.550> first<00:00:52.420> found

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
around my sophomore year I first found

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.930 
around my sophomore year I first found
out<00:00:52.720> about<00:00:52.780> md<00:00:53.260> PhD<00:00:53.560> programs<00:00:54.130> that<00:00:54.430> could

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
out about md PhD programs that could

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.370 
out about md PhD programs that could
really<00:00:55.120> allow<00:00:55.480> them<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.690> combine<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.050> lot<00:00:56.290> of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
really allow them to combine a lot of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.870 
really allow them to combine a lot of
those<00:00:56.500> address<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:58.150> so<00:00:59.020> I<00:00:59.710> Jenna<00:01:00.670> number

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
those address and so I Jenna number

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.510 
those address and so I Jenna number
places<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.810> few<00:01:02.680> things<00:01:02.890> really<00:01:03.160> struck<00:01:03.489> me

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
places and a few things really struck me

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.130 
places and a few things really struck me
about<00:01:03.760> Sean<00:01:04.180> I

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
about Sean I

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.170 
about Sean I
they<00:01:05.740> they<00:01:06.250> were<00:01:06.310> really<00:01:06.580> focusing<00:01:07.060> on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
they they were really focusing on

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.390 
they they were really focusing on
translational<00:01:07.810> research<00:01:07.990> on<00:01:08.800> bridging<00:01:09.310> the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
translational research on bridging the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.760 
translational research on bridging the
gap<00:01:09.640> between<00:01:09.670> sort<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.990> basic<00:01:11.350> science

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
gap between sort of the basic science

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.280 
gap between sort of the basic science
and<00:01:11.920> clinical<00:01:12.420> applications<00:01:13.420> they<00:01:13.990> have<00:01:14.140> this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
and clinical applications they have this

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.050 
and clinical applications they have this
computational<00:01:14.979> biology<00:01:15.400> program<00:01:15.610> P<00:01:15.940> that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
computational biology program P that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.450 
computational biology program P that
open<00:01:16.330> NYU<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:17.380> really<00:01:17.650> allowed<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.340> know

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
open NYU that really allowed you know

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.070 
open NYU that really allowed you know
different<00:01:18.700> perspectives<00:01:19.510> in<00:01:19.659> math<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
different perspectives in math and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.260 
different perspectives in math and
computer<00:01:20.830> science<00:01:20.860> as<00:01:21.310> well<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.150> that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
computer science as well and so that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.710 
computer science as well and so that
really<00:01:22.300> stuck<00:01:22.780> out<00:01:22.930> at<00:01:23.110> me<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.270> know<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.390> end

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
really stuck out at me so you know I end

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.760 
really stuck out at me so you know I end
up<00:01:25.810> here<00:01:25.869> enough<00:01:26.640> I've<00:01:27.640> loved<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.060> ever<00:01:28.119> since

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
up here enough I've loved it ever since

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.109 
up here enough I've loved it ever since
right<00:01:29.770> now<00:01:29.920> I'm<00:01:30.040> working<00:01:30.190> in<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.550> lab<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.759> dr.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
right now I'm working in the lab of dr.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.480 
right now I'm working in the lab of dr.
Stuart<00:01:31.630> steel<00:01:31.840> phone<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.950> focus<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
Stuart steel phone and the focus of the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.240 
Stuart steel phone and the focus of the
lab<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.909> really<00:01:34.659> understanding<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.560> guess

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
lab is really understanding I guess

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.999 
lab is really understanding I guess
mechanisms<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:37.030> response<00:01:37.509> specificity<00:01:38.229> it's

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
mechanisms of response specificity it's

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.550 
mechanisms of response specificity it's
a<00:01:39.100> fancy<00:01:39.340> term<00:01:39.729> but<00:01:40.060> it's<00:01:40.539> basically<00:01:40.780> why<00:01:41.500> do

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
a fancy term but it's basically why do

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.350 
a fancy term but it's basically why do
cells<00:01:41.830> respond<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> way<00:01:42.520> they<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:43.270> I'll

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
cells respond the way they do so I'll

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
cells respond the way they do so I'll
see<00:01:43.630> all<00:01:43.869> these<00:01:44.320> different<00:01:44.590> signals<00:01:45.039> in<00:01:45.190> their

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
see all these different signals in their

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.400 
see all these different signals in their
environment<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.390> hundreds<00:01:46.840> thousands<00:01:47.380> of

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
environment in the hundreds thousands of

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.499 
environment in the hundreds thousands of
different<00:01:47.590> signals<00:01:48.220> growth<00:01:48.550> factors<00:01:49.060> citing

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
different signals growth factors citing

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.450 
different signals growth factors citing
are<00:01:49.660> totally<00:01:50.020> dependent<00:01:50.200> they<00:01:51.160> able<00:01:51.369> to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
are totally dependent they able to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.190 
are totally dependent they able to
generate<00:01:51.880> all<00:01:52.119> these<00:01:52.330> very<00:01:52.600> specific

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
generate all these very specific

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.719 
generate all these very specific
responses<00:01:53.800> they<00:01:53.890> really<00:01:54.160> seem<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.460> know<00:01:54.580> what

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
responses they really seem to know what

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.930 
responses they really seem to know what
to<00:01:54.789> do<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.830> how<00:01:56.830> they<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.310> those<00:01:57.490> specific

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
to do and how they get those specific

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.580 
to do and how they get those specific
responses<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.630> really<00:01:59.020> not<00:01:59.200> well<00:01:59.470> understood

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
responses is really not well understood

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.630 
responses is really not well understood
and<00:02:00.130> what<00:02:01.090> really<00:02:01.270> drew<00:02:01.450> me<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.720> this<00:02:01.840> line<00:02:02.110> is

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and what really drew me to this line is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.320 
and what really drew me to this line is
dr.<00:02:03.640> Sullins<00:02:04.060> approach<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:05.140> combining

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
dr. Sullins approach of combining

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.450 
dr. Sullins approach of combining
experimental<00:02:07.330> work<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.380> that's<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.429> know

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
experimental work and so that's you know

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.040 
experimental work and so that's you know
that<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.060> right<00:02:10.240> on<00:02:10.300> my<00:02:10.420> family<00:02:10.810> that's

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that was right on my family that's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.100 
that was right on my family that's
really<00:02:11.290> what<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> wanted<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.860> do<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.870> I've<00:02:13.870> had

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
really what I wanted to do and I've had

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.710 
really what I wanted to do and I've had
a<00:02:14.140> great<00:02:14.410> time<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.860> far<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.700> know<00:02:15.850> I'm<00:02:16.270> just<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
a great time so far you know I'm just a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.750 
a great time so far you know I'm just a
practical<00:02:17.290> level<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> petting<00:02:18.550> gets

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
practical level you know I petting gets

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
practical level you know I petting gets
a<00:02:18.880> little<00:02:19.030> too<00:02:19.180> boring<00:02:19.540> back<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.930> forth<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.380> can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
a little too boring back and forth I can

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.890 
a little too boring back and forth I can
switch<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.100> serve<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> more<00:02:22.120> theoretical<00:02:22.360> side

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
switch to serve a more theoretical side

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.770 
switch to serve a more theoretical side
more<00:02:23.890> mathematical<00:02:24.550> Matthew<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.540> side

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
more mathematical Matthew on one side

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
more mathematical Matthew on one side
and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:26.200> know<00:02:26.800> when<00:02:27.070> there's<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.520> robe<00:02:27.880> off

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and then know when there's a robe off

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.330 
and then know when there's a robe off
their<00:02:28.360> kind<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.110> go<00:02:29.230> back<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.440> forth<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
their kind of go back and forth and I

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.610 
their kind of go back and forth and I
really<00:02:30.940> liked<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.209> integration<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
really liked that integration and the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.220 
really liked that integration and the
project<00:02:32.860> has<00:02:33.160> been<00:02:33.340> great<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.850> one<00:02:34.840> really

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
project has been great and one really

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.070 
project has been great and one really
nice<00:02:35.500> feature<00:02:35.800> about<00:02:35.980> working<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.670> an<00:02:37.480> mg<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
nice feature about working for an mg is

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540 
nice feature about working for an mg is
there's<00:02:38.380> always<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.890> kind<00:02:39.430> of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
there's always that kind of

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.370 
there's always that kind of
translational<00:02:40.270> focus<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.930> well<00:02:41.170> that

translational focus as well that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.050 
translational focus as well that
translational<00:02:41.980> picture<00:02:42.310> even<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:42.940> it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
translational picture even if it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.550 
translational picture even if it's
slightly<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.600> background<00:02:44.110> sometimes

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
slightly in the background sometimes

slightly in the background sometimes
wooden<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.010> project<00:02:45.430> gives<00:02:45.550> more<00:02:45.820> basic

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
wooden the project gives more basic

science filled you're always thinking
well<00:02:48.700> how<00:02:48.850> can<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.150> relate<00:02:49.650> diseases<00:02:50.650> happen

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
well how can this relate diseases happen

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.860 
well how can this relate diseases happen
this<00:02:51.100> relate<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.459> improve<00:02:52.120> their<00:02:52.330> future<00:02:52.690> to

this relate to improve their future to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.630 
this relate to improve their future to
improve<00:02:53.110> diagnostics<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.520> that's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
improve diagnostics and so that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.520 
improve diagnostics and so that's
something<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.720> know<00:02:55.840> moving<00:02:56.200> forward

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
something that you know moving forward

things<00:03:04.739> at<00:03:05.069> mount<00:03:05.250> sinai<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> i<00:03:07.230> got<00:03:07.650> i<00:03:07.890> guess

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
things at mount sinai and i got i guess

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.699 
things at mount sinai and i got i guess
involved<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.849> some<00:03:09.379> something<00:03:10.379> that<00:03:10.530> wouldn't

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
involved in some something that wouldn't

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.320 
involved in some something that wouldn't
guess<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.099> was<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.430> involved<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:11.819> getting

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
guess I was not involved with getting

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.790 
guess I was not involved with getting
started<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:14.069> might<00:03:14.220> guess<00:03:14.550> from<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.800> few

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
started as you might guess from the few

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070 
started as you might guess from the few
questions<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.640> far<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> bit<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.450> science<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
questions so far on a bit of a science I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.960 
questions so far on a bit of a science I
didn't<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.739> had<00:03:20.010> some<00:03:20.250> outside<00:03:20.819> and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
didn't you know had some outside and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.140 
didn't you know had some outside and
crystal<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.540> booth<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:22.230> most<00:03:22.410> designs<00:03:23.150> but

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
crystal and booth with most designs but

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.990 
crystal and booth with most designs but
then<00:03:24.269> starting<00:03:24.599> at<00:03:24.690> Mount<00:03:24.870> Sinai<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:26.610> think

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
then starting at Mount Sinai and I think

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.160 
then starting at Mount Sinai and I think
this<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.120> something<00:03:27.420> that's<00:03:27.540> unique<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.959> this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
this is something that's unique to this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.280 
this is something that's unique to this
environment<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:29.069> really<00:03:29.819> got<00:03:30.750> involved<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
environment I really got involved in a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.920 
environment I really got involved in a
lot<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.530> different<00:03:31.849> humanistic<00:03:32.849> area<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.690> one

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
lot of different humanistic area so one

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.360 
lot of different humanistic area so one
thing<00:03:34.019> that's<00:03:34.230> unique<00:03:34.290> about<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.890> saw<00:03:35.160> an<00:03:35.220> eye

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
thing that's unique about my saw an eye

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
thing that's unique about my saw an eye

the<00:04:01.349> outside<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.860> classroom<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:03.390> know

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the outside the classroom that you know

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.270 
the outside the classroom that you know
I<00:04:03.540> might<00:04:03.840> not<00:04:03.959> guess<00:04:04.260> some<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.470> them<00:04:04.680> would

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
I might not guess some of them would

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.380 
I might not guess some of them would
have<00:04:05.310> been<00:04:05.640> interested<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.389> going<00:04:06.630> in

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
have been interested and going in

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.750 
have been interested and going in
that's<00:04:08.050> something<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.440> guess<00:04:08.550> unique<00:04:09.550> about

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that's something I guess unique about

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.730 
that's something I guess unique about
man<00:04:09.940> sonic<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.569> getting<00:04:11.080> exposed<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.560> so

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
man sonic just getting exposed to so

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.559 
man sonic just getting exposed to so
many<00:04:11.860> different<00:04:11.980> viewpoints<00:04:12.640> really<00:04:12.940> really

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
many different viewpoints really really

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.750 
many different viewpoints really really
kind<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> broad<00:04:14.680> into<00:04:14.920> your<00:04:15.010> world<00:04:15.190> view<00:04:15.310> and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
kind of a broad into your world view and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.280 
kind of a broad into your world view and
you'll<00:04:16.269> end<00:04:16.420> up<00:04:16.480> doing<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.750> lot<00:04:16.780> but<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
you'll end up doing a lot but the

fellow as I walk by mineralogy residents
there's<00:05:58.390> just<00:05:58.570> this<00:05:58.750> constant<00:05:59.050> integration

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
there's just this constant integration

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.570 
there's just this constant integration
of<00:06:00.190> medicine<00:06:01.800> science<00:06:02.800> medicine<00:06:03.430> and

of medicine science medicine and

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.150 
of medicine science medicine and
research<00:06:03.910> that<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:04.780> really<00:06:05.110> you<00:06:05.410> know<00:06:05.440> unit<00:06:05.890> as

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
research that I really you know unit as

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.070 
research that I really you know unit as
an<00:06:06.370> undergraduate<00:06:06.730> prisoner<00:06:07.240> shouldn't<00:06:07.990> have

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
an undergraduate prisoner shouldn't have

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.810 
an undergraduate prisoner shouldn't have
a<00:06:08.110> medical<00:06:08.470> school<00:06:08.590> I<00:06:08.680> mean<00:06:08.890> I've<00:06:08.980> never<00:06:09.310> had

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
a medical school I mean I've never had

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.350 
a medical school I mean I've never had
seen<00:06:10.150> before<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:10.870> so<00:06:11.470> even<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:12.400> know<00:06:12.490> even<00:06:13.120> as

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
seen before and so even you know even as

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.930 
seen before and so even you know even as
a<00:06:13.390> researcher<00:06:14.020> euro<00:06:14.500> was<00:06:14.680> thinking<00:06:15.070> about

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
a researcher euro was thinking about

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.310 
a researcher euro was thinking about
medicine<00:06:16.450> how<00:06:16.600> does<00:06:16.750> relates<00:06:17.050> back<00:06:17.260> to

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
medicine how does relates back to

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.100 
medicine how does relates back to
patients<00:06:17.950> as<00:06:18.100> as<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:19.300> position<00:06:19.990> you're

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
patients as as a position you're

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.660 
patients as as a position you're
thinking<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.830> know<00:06:20.920> about<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.340> research

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
thinking you know about the research

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.360 
thinking you know about the research
side<00:06:22.290> mechanisms<00:06:23.290> and<00:06:23.470> and<00:06:23.710> things<00:06:24.190> like<00:06:24.310> that

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
side mechanisms and and things like that

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.270 
side mechanisms and and things like that
underlying<00:06:25.270> disease<00:06:25.720> and<00:06:25.990> so<00:06:26.170> as<00:06:26.470> an<00:06:26.560> md/phd

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
underlying disease and so as an md/phd

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.920 
underlying disease and so as an md/phd
that's<00:06:27.490> really<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.850> training<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.420> wanted

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
that's really the training I wanted

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.710 
that's really the training I wanted
and<00:06:29.199> the<00:06:29.320> PhDs<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.970> future<00:06:31.270> position

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
and the PhDs the future position

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.930 
and the PhDs the future position
scientists<00:06:32.229> rule<00:06:32.410> will<00:06:32.949> be<00:06:33.100> ideally<00:06:33.580> suited

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
scientists rule will be ideally suited

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.550 
scientists rule will be ideally suited
to<00:06:34.090> really<00:06:34.690> bridge<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.139> gap<00:06:35.350> between

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
to really bridge the gap between

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.980 
to really bridge the gap between
medicine<00:06:36.039> and<00:06:36.250> research<00:06:36.460> really<00:06:37.000> accelerate

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
medicine and research really accelerate

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.529 
medicine and research really accelerate
the<00:06:38.110> development<00:06:38.229> of<00:06:38.759> cures<00:06:39.759> for<00:06:40.030> patients

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
the development of cures for patients

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.090 
the development of cures for patients
and<00:06:40.600> being<00:06:41.139> in<00:06:41.199> a<00:06:41.289> place<00:06:41.470> like<00:06:41.590> Mount<00:06:41.889> Sinai

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
and being in a place like Mount Sinai

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.890 
and being in a place like Mount Sinai
really<00:06:42.580> gives<00:06:43.180> you<00:06:43.270> a<00:06:43.300> feeling<00:06:43.630> and

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
really gives you a feeling and

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.379 
really gives you a feeling and
appreciation<00:06:44.590> for<00:06:44.919> how<00:06:45.160> that's<00:06:45.400> possible<00:06:45.639> and

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
appreciation for how that's possible and

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.110 
appreciation for how that's possible and
how<00:06:46.570> you'll<00:06:46.750> be<00:06:46.780> able<00:06:46.930> to
