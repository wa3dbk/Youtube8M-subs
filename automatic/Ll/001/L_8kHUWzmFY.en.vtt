00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.370
 who wanted to buy the resident evil 6 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.760
 but I realized something very important 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.680
 and that was did not have the necessary console 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.680
 to play it and my reaction was 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 then I decided to get an xbox 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.820

 evil 6 but it was exhausted I was three 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.150
 days in depression I did not go to school

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.920
 watching the titanic movie one and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.869

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.860

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.140
 then I made myself a decaffeinated coffee 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.360
