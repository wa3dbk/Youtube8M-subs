suppose they could do that in
stop-motion<00:01:39.100> okay<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:42.280> moving<00:01:43.280> along<00:01:43.990> they

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
stop-motion okay so moving along they

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.450 
stop-motion okay so moving along they
did<00:01:45.140> some<00:01:45.289> more<00:01:45.380> enemies<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.009> set<00:01:46.280> this
