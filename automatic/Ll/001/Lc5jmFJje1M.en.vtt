00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.740
 first time art caravaggio 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 not in great demand and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.120
 brought him only pennies 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.190
 but the talent of the beginning artist is not long 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.500
 remained unvalued 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.180
 but I would pay attention cardinal

 commissioned by this wealthy 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.460
 patron caravaggio wrote a lot 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.350
 canvases 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 depicting a beautiful wife 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.269
 like young men 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.680
 yan eroticism of these characters biographers 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.099
 artist considers person 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.129
 confirmation that he shared 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.809
 homosexual addictions of his 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
 high patron 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.949
 already in the early works of the bed makes it clear 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.459
 that only one source acknowledges 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.400
 creativity 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.189
 surrounding reality 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.269
 far from classic 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:32.999
 ideals 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.849
 no accidental themes of some of his canvases 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.129
 becomes will be rogue society so 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.109
 most artist makes a conclusion on the bride 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.999
 the number of fanciful traditions 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.329
 not inferior to caravaggio on its principles and 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.799
 filling the church ordered his blog 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.070
 similar to the peasants 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.579
 and religious scenes on everyday scenes 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.180
 after seeing the compositions of the death of Mary 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.989
 priests of one of the Roman churches 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.919
 some artist performed this work 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.719
 refused to pick up their order they were outraged then 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.200
 what the apostles maria 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.190
 caravaggio depicted without divine 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.219
 fluttering like ordinary people 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.109
 Svyatoshin didn't care how much 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 subtly the artist has managed to convey feelings 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.509
 their characters 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.269
 in this and other pictures in the period 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.210
 its heyday 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.120
 caravaggio use light and shadow like 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.390
 artistic items 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.910
 helping to create internal 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.179
 stresses 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.329
 it was said that he painted his canvases in 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.349
 a dark room and cut through the ceiling 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.229
 holes through which passed 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.309
 Sun rays 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.939
 some paintings were also said 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.159
 wrote using the law of the mirror 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.870
 trying to better catch three dimensions 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.919
 items because the figure he will have 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.649
 warm bulk almost everything is legal 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.859
 In short, I used August 30 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:37.810
 their words 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.730
 but revered loved him mainly 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.989
 commoners 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.129
 the powers that be did not give at the sight 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.180
 peasant faces 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.490
 for everyone could brag 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.409
 artists 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.439
 meeting caravaggio on the street they did not miss 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.539
 case to give him your contempt 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.660
 unbalanced hot anatolia 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.240
 the artist often defended himself from 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.499
 verbal attacks with sword in hand 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.539
 in may 1600 sixth year he turned out 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.019
 party fights as a result of which 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.709
 two were killed and the artist himself was wounded 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.819
 accusation of unintentional 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.569
 kill kill 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.620
 required 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.379
 some time he lived in naples where 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.340
 managed to make a few to order 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.750
 church paintings then moved to 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.159
 malta refuge of the knightly order 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.139
 completing the portrait of the grandmaster organ 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.079
 Caravaggio received a knightly award 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.749
 rank 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:22.669
 but hold high not 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.850
 insulted representatives of the authorities 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.330
 and got behind bars 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.030
 escaped from prison for several 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.590
 years wandered eating 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.250
 when he finally decided to return to 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.669
 Rome to ask for forgiveness he was robbed 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.020
 he was ready to pass the centurions on foot 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.680
 but terrible embarking on arat his 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.590
 stopped 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.750
 on the eighteenth of July he is 1610 by caravaggio 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.449
 which was not thirty seven 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.659

 she is a terrible sharp ruthless really 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:06.150
 his motto 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.180
 and impressions
