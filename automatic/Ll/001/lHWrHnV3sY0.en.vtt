00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
up and throwing them off the stage some

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.400 
up and throwing them off the stage some
areas<00:05:58.850> are<00:05:59.150> just<00:05:59.300> impossible<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.900> complete<00:06:00.290> as

a<00:06:00.440> team<00:06:00.770> you'll<00:06:01.250> have<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.550> go<00:06:01.669> into<00:06:01.820> like<00:06:02.030> your

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
a team you'll have to go into like your

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.880 
a team you'll have to go into like your
own<00:06:02.300> little<00:06:02.510> bubble<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:03.140> get<00:06:03.290> past<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:03.770> and

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
own little bubble to get past it and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.890 
own little bubble to get past it and
even<00:06:04.370> then<00:06:04.700> bubbles<00:06:05.120> would<00:06:05.240> just<00:06:05.419> pop<00:06:05.630> on

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
even then bubbles would just pop on

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.990 
even then bubbles would just pop on
their<00:06:06.110> own<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:06.590> that's<00:06:07.190> it<00:06:07.460> you're<00:06:07.790> dead

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
their own and that's it you're dead

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.909

hopefully<00:06:08.960> Nintendo<00:06:09.350> can<00:06:09.500> improve<00:06:09.740> on<00:06:09.890> that
