00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940 

I<00:00:02.659> think<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.689> next-generation<00:00:04.110> classroom<00:00:04.799> is

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
I think a next-generation classroom is

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.909 
I think a next-generation classroom is
one<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.600> not<00:00:06.839> necessarily<00:00:07.379> laden<00:00:07.830> with

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
one that is not necessarily laden with

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.240 
one that is not necessarily laden with
technology<00:00:08.700> but<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.620> infused<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.830> sort<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
technology but is infused with sort of a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.220 
technology but is infused with sort of a
new<00:00:11.460> way<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.700> teaching<00:00:12.300> students<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
new way of teaching students and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.870 
new way of teaching students and
actually<00:00:13.679> getting<00:00:14.160> them<00:00:14.280> engaged<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.730> their

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
actually getting them engaged in their

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
actually getting them engaged in their
learning<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> different<00:00:15.599> way<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.350> role<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
learning in a different way the role of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.779 
learning in a different way the role of
the<00:00:17.730> student<00:00:18.289> will<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:20.000> moving<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
the student will be moving from a

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.599 
the student will be moving from a
passive<00:00:23.789> learner<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:25.410> active<00:00:26.010> learner<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
passive learner to an active learner and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.269 
passive learner to an active learner and
so<00:00:26.900> that's<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> shift<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so that's going to be a shift in the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.170 
so that's going to be a shift in the
role<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.730> instructor<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:32.180> student

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
role of the instructor and the student

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299 
role of the instructor and the student
so<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.870> from<00:00:34.260> research<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> in

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so we know from from research that in

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.069 
so we know from from research that in
order<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.030> students<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> remember<00:00:36.690> things

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
order for students to remember things

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
order for students to remember things
and<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.469> apply<00:00:38.370> them<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.270> have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and to apply them they have to they have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.479 
and to apply them they have to they have
to<00:00:39.390> work<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to work with them they have to take this

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
to work with them they have to take this
information<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.530> fit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
information and actually make it fit

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
information and actually make it fit
into<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.640> already<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> their

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
into what they already know and to their

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
world who can really do great critical

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.700 
world who can really do great critical
thinking<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.270> when<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:07.049> are<00:02:07.290> practicing

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
thinking and so when we are practicing

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
thinking and so when we are practicing
critical<00:02:08.429> thinking<00:02:08.819> every<00:02:09.360> single<00:02:09.750> day<00:02:09.929> as

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
critical thinking every single day as

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
critical thinking every single day as
opposed<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.920> passive<00:02:11.400> reception<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
opposed to passive reception of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.300 
opposed to passive reception of
knowledge

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
knowledge

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.250 
knowledge
we<00:02:13.670> are<00:02:13.819> going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.269> such<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> payoff<00:02:15.019> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
we are going to get such a payoff I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.190 
we are going to get such a payoff I
think<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.370> future<00:02:16.549> because<00:02:17.180> students<00:02:18.079> are

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
think in the future because students are

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.300 
think in the future because students are
going<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.500> know<00:02:18.769> how<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.189> critical

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
going to know how to do critical

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.429 
going to know how to do critical
thinking<00:02:19.909> here<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.569> then<00:02:21.079> they're<00:02:21.170> going<00:02:21.349> to

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
thinking here and then they're going to

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.630 
thinking here and then they're going to
move<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.799> into<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> world<00:02:22.250> they're<00:02:22.459> going<00:02:22.579> to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
know how to dig in they're going to know

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.149 
know how to dig in they're going to know
how<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.110> talk<00:02:24.379> about<00:02:24.439> difficult<00:02:24.890> topics

they're going to know how to apply

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.530 
they're going to know how to apply
knowledge<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.189> current<00:02:28.549> situations<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.510> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
knowledge to current situations and so I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.899 
knowledge to current situations and so I
really<00:02:29.840> feel<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.129> payoff<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.760> to

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
really feel like the payoff is going to

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.390 
really feel like the payoff is going to
be<00:02:31.970> great<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:32.659> the<00:02:33.079> learners<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.769> tomorrow

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
be great for the learners of tomorrow

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.280 
be great for the learners of tomorrow
for<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> kind<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.269> workers<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.930> need<00:02:36.079> for

for the kind of workers that we need for

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.990 
for the kind of workers that we need for
tomorrow<00:02:36.590> it'll<00:02:36.739> be<00:02:36.799> an<00:02:37.129> absolutely<00:02:37.790> terrific
