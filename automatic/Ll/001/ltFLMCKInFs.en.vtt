that<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.720> wish<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.900> were

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.960 

so<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.260> game<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> classically<00:01:26.670> styled

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so the game is this classically styled

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
so the game is this classically styled
2d<00:01:27.540> beat<00:01:27.750> amount<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.710> turtles<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
time battletoads that kind of thing only

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.440 
time battletoads that kind of thing only
with<00:01:31.740> customization<00:01:32.340> fewer<00:01:33.240> enemies

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
with customization fewer enemies

emphasis on individual battles and like

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720 
emphasis on individual battles and like
the<00:01:37.020> most<00:01:37.230> complicated<00:01:37.740> fighting<00:01:38.340> system

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
the most complicated fighting system

ever devised by people on on earth
maybe<00:01:43.710> games<00:01:43.980> are<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.610> Neptune<00:01:44.970> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
maybe games are like this on Neptune I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
maybe games are like this on Neptune I
don't<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:46.440> start<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.920> creating<00:01:47.370> your

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't know you start by creating your

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.470 
don't know you start by creating your
cyborg

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
cyborg

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.240 
cyborg
basically<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.260> are<00:01:49.320> three<00:01:49.590> parts<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.040> each

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
basically there are three parts to each

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.680 
basically there are three parts to each
one<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.150> gives<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> several

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
one and the game gives you several

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.350 
one and the game gives you several
options<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.410> each<00:01:52.620> part<00:01:52.980> evidently<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:54.120> math

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
options for each part evidently the math

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
options for each part evidently the math
adds<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:54.980> more<00:01:55.980> than<00:01:56.160> 200<00:01:56.760> possible

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
adds up to more than 200 possible

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
adds up to more than 200 possible
combinations<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.680> evidently<00:01:58.980> each<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.520> would

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
combinations in evidently each one would

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.130 
combinations in evidently each one would
have<00:01:59.820> its<00:01:59.970> own<00:02:00.060> unique<00:02:00.120> abilities<00:02:00.900> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
have its own unique abilities and
