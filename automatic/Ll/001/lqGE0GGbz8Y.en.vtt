some of the new features and stuff i

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
some of the new features and stuff i
implemented<00:01:24.570> i'll<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.960> quick<00:01:25.229> patches<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
implemented i'll do quick patches and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
implemented i'll do quick patches and
we'll<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.790> things<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.720> it'll<00:01:27.960> keep

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
we'll get things going but it'll keep

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
we'll get things going but it'll keep
going<00:01:28.500> around<00:01:28.619> until<00:01:29.250> four<00:01:29.579> p.m.<00:01:29.610> mountain

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
going around until four p.m. mountain

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.080 
going around until four p.m. mountain
time<00:01:30.450> us<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:33.030> fifteenth<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.840> sep<00:01:34.020> tember

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
time us on the fifteenth of sep tember

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
time us on the fifteenth of sep tember
so<00:01:36.090> it'll<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.329> hopefully<00:01:36.780> close<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> 24<00:01:37.470> hours

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
so it'll be hopefully close to 24 hours

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
so it'll be hopefully close to 24 hours
if<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.860> don't<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.100> any<00:01:38.220> bugs<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.869> then<00:01:39.869> if

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
if we don't have any bugs and then if

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
if we don't have any bugs and then if
you<00:01:40.049> need<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.229> converted<00:01:41.009> around<00:01:41.310> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you need that converted around just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
you need that converted around just
google<00:01:43.220> for<00:01:44.220> p.m.<00:01:44.520> mountain<00:01:45.299> time<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
google for p.m. mountain time to and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.810 
google for p.m. mountain time to and
then<00:01:46.710> whatever<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> name<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.430> timezone

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
then whatever the name of your timezone

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.139 
then whatever the name of your timezone
is<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.509> Google<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.840> convert<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
is and then Google will convert for you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.730 
is and then Google will convert for you
so<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> should<00:01:51.479> hopefully<00:01:51.600> let<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> but

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
so that should hopefully let you in but

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
so that should hopefully let you in but
they<00:01:53.460> should<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:53.880> most<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> times<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
they should be up most the times if you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.469 
they should be up most the times if you
