good in rehabbing tennis this exercise

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.630 
good in rehabbing tennis this exercise
is<00:00:17.760> fantastic<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:19.199> helping<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.859> strengthen

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
is fantastic for helping to strengthen

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.700 
is fantastic for helping to strengthen
the<00:00:20.730> muscle<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.900> call<00:00:22.080> eccentric

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the muscle in what we call eccentric

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.170 
the muscle in what we call eccentric
loading<00:00:23.039> something<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> should<00:00:23.760> understand

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
loading something you should understand

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.859 
loading something you should understand
about<00:00:24.240> muscles<00:00:24.750> muscles<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.730> contract<00:00:26.869> while

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
about muscles muscles can contract while

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.030 
about muscles muscles can contract while
they<00:00:28.050> shorten<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.699> as<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.300> biceps

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
they shorten as as in my biceps

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.500 
they shorten as as in my biceps
shortening<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> contracts<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.390> can

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
shortening as it contracts but they can

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.290 
shortening as it contracts but they can
also<00:00:33.690> lengthen<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:34.980> contract<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.969> as

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
also lengthen as they contract that's as

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.619 
also lengthen as they contract that's as
I<00:00:36.690> bring<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> weight<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:38.629> most

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
I bring the weight back down most

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.660 
I bring the weight back down most
muscles<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.410> hurt<00:00:40.739> from<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.430> sports

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
muscles get hurt from a sports

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.869 
muscles get hurt from a sports
perspective<00:00:42.110> in<00:00:43.110> eccentric<00:00:44.010> loading<00:00:44.309> which

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
perspective in eccentric loading which

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.690 
perspective in eccentric loading which
is<00:00:45.120> muscle<00:00:45.719> lengthening<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:47.280> contracts

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
is muscle lengthening as it contracts

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.119 
is muscle lengthening as it contracts
and<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.809> exercise<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> all<00:00:49.710> based<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and so this exercise is all based on

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
and so this exercise is all based on
creating<00:00:50.640> eccentric<00:00:51.300> strength<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> what

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
creating eccentric strength so what

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
creating eccentric strength so what
we're<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> take<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.570> these

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we're going to do is take and these

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
we're going to do is take and these
steps<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.440> important<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.760> we'll<00:00:56.910> go

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
steps are very important so we'll go

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760 
steps are very important so we'll go
through<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.329> slowly<00:00:57.870> first<00:00:58.590> thing<00:00:58.680> we're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
through them slowly first thing we're

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
through them slowly first thing we're
going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.460> put<00:00:59.730> our<00:00:59.850> wrist<00:01:00.120> back<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
going to do is put our wrist back in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
going to do is put our wrist back in
extension<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.530> our<00:01:01.649> elbow<00:01:02.070> by<00:01:02.340> our<00:01:02.550> side

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
extension and our elbow by our side

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
extension and our elbow by our side
we're<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> Thera<00:01:04.260> bar<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.799> our

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
we're going to put the Thera bar in our

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.609 
we're going to put the Thera bar in our
hand<00:01:05.939> stay<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.600> position<00:01:07.049> we're<00:01:07.500> going

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hand stay in this position we're going

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890 
hand stay in this position we're going
to<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.799> our<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.130> hand<00:01:08.659> facing<00:01:09.659> away<00:01:09.750> from

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to take our other hand facing away from

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.920 
to take our other hand facing away from
us<00:01:10.320> put<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> top<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> Thera<00:01:12.450> bar<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
us put it up on top of the Thera bar and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
us put it up on top of the Thera bar and
with<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.220> far<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.790> our

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
with it back as far as it can go our

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
with it back as far as it can go our
elbow<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.360> far<00:01:15.540> far<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> rotate<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
elbow as far far as we can rotate and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
elbow as far far as we can rotate and
then<00:01:18.060> we're<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> take<00:01:18.540> keeping<00:01:19.229> our

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
then we're going to take keeping our

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.620 
then we're going to take keeping our
wrist<00:01:19.590> back<00:01:19.799> bring<00:01:20.430> our<00:01:20.549> arms<00:01:20.970> straight<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
wrist back bring our arms straight and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.520 
wrist back bring our arms straight and
then<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> slowly<00:01:24.170> let<00:01:25.170> our<00:01:25.290> wrist

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then we're going to slowly let our wrist

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.819 
then we're going to slowly let our wrist
go<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.659> with<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.930> we're<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> get

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
go out with that we're going to get

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219 
go out with that we're going to get
eccentric<00:01:29.729> loading<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.570> lengthening

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
eccentric loading of this a lengthening

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
eccentric loading of this a lengthening
of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.439> muscle<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.130> contract<00:01:32.579> against<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
of the muscle as we contract against the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
of the muscle as we contract against the
bar<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.869> also<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> good

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
bar we're also going to get a good

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
bar we're also going to get a good
stretch<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> end<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.360> shouldn't

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
stretch right at the end that shouldn't

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.680 
stretch right at the end that shouldn't
be<00:01:36.840> painful<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.409> you
