figures that are available so which one

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.550 
figures that are available so which one
we<00:03:38.390> will<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:38.989> get<00:03:39.290> I'm<00:03:39.530> not<00:03:39.890> sure<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.989> then

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560

so every time you buy a perform one ball

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.910 
so every time you buy a perform one ball
you<00:03:53.510> figures<00:03:53.900> will<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.170> included<00:03:54.620> inside<00:03:54.860> a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
you figures will be included inside a

you figures will be included inside a
plastic<00:03:55.160> bag<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.569> make<00:03:56.720> sure<00:03:56.930> you

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
plastic bag this is to make sure you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.690 
plastic bag this is to make sure you
don't<00:03:57.349> know<00:03:57.530> which<00:03:57.890> figure<00:03:58.250> you're<00:03:58.370> gonna<00:03:58.459> get

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
don't know which figure you're gonna get

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.369 
don't know which figure you're gonna get
so<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.209> can<00:03:59.390> be<00:03:59.510> quite<00:03:59.690> annoying<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.230> can't
