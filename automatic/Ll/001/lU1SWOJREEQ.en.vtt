00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the Kevlar you can see it has a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
the Kevlar you can see it has a little
more<00:01:29.400> texture<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> little

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
more texture to it and as a little

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
more texture to it and as a little
rougher<00:01:31.799> feeling<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.460> cool<00:01:32.670> stuff<00:01:32.790> but

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
rougher feeling it's cool stuff but

a little finer tighter weave tighter
grain<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.340> also<00:01:41.610> backed<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:43.009> holds<00:01:44.009> up

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
grain but also backed and holds up

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
grain but also backed and holds up
really<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.770> both<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:47.610> flame<00:01:48.180> resistant

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
