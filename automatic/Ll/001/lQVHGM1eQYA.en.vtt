00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hello everyone, I decided to take off the painting 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 camera 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.549
 what happened then it is not completed yet 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.170
 here is such a box 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:22.560
 bottom at the edges of the walls conclusions outside 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.560
 there they pass by the gate of course still 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.230
 not to crash something every once 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 do not reach the hands over probably later booty 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 what will it be done 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 in 600 doing the lighting she 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 oil separator with pressure gauge regulator 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 pressure compressors in general tried it 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:57.739
 But with this thing I opened it all 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.979
 pressure from 8 atmospheres drops to three and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.100
 keeps three constantly that is me so 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.299
 I think enough 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 to color continuously without interrupting 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:19.790
 no need to wait for compressor 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:22.640
 shook the air did the locker on the right 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.870
 there is a tool here such 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.300
 small 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:33.080
 the table is half down 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.420
 that is, when to paint 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.570
 so that small sizes do not interfere 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.090
 in this closet now we will show something for now 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.060
 more rubbish everywhere 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.860
 attacked no need to clean up tomorrow in advance 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.110
 prepare the car like this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820
 shelves 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.960
 there is enough crap there still remains 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:09.090
 I will add two more places there 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:10.550
 shelves here did so here is the locker at the top 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.710
 two shelves below 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:19.170
 1 here for clothes to change clothes 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.050
 compressor separately video take off 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.140
 there the whole installation turned out is 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 insulated at the top of the roof 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.420
 In general, this part is the edge of the ceiling 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:42.239
 but how extreme the ceiling is here 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.750
 under the ceiling hangs this bark then 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.600
 to paint all 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.440
 tomorrow we will go to buy a scrap here 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.440
 the camera turned out 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.300
 let's see how it will work all 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.380
 I will shoot later to work 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.380
 show camera
