of an unconventional way it's been
making<00:00:18.840> its<00:00:19.020> way<00:00:19.410> into<00:00:19.650> more<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.250> more<00:00:20.340> LEGO

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
making its way into more and more LEGO

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.650 
making its way into more and more LEGO
sets<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.560> but<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.240> very<00:00:24.600> useful

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

making your own creations for some
details<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> sometimes<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.140> hard<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> come

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
details and sometimes it's hard to come

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
details and sometimes it's hard to come
up<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:28.769> examples<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.630> later<00:00:30.810> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
up with examples but I have one later in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.519 
up with examples but I have one later in

anyway<00:00:32.160> let's<00:00:32.369> say<00:00:32.520> you've<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.700> yourself<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
anyway let's say you've got yourself a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
anyway let's say you've got yourself a
small<00:00:33.390> stack<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.079> bricks<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
small stack of bricks like this and you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.160 
small stack of bricks like this and you
want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.910> branch<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> next

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
want to kind of branch out with the next

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
want to kind of branch out with the next
brick<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.620> whatever<00:00:37.739> reason<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:39.420> could<00:00:39.570> do

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
brick for whatever reason you could do

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.270 
brick for whatever reason you could do
something<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.710> looks<00:00:41.040> kind

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
something like this but this looks kind

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
something like this but this looks kind
of<00:00:41.340> ugly<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:42.510> too<00:00:42.870> detailed<00:00:43.290> especially

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of ugly and not too detailed especially

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.630 
of ugly and not too detailed especially
we<00:00:44.160> continue<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.039> extending<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we continue can you know extending this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.700 
we continue can you know extending this
stack

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
stack

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
stack
maybe<00:00:49.710> instead<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> could<00:00:51.510> try<00:00:51.719> something

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
maybe instead you could try something

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.549 
maybe instead you could try something
like<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:53.480> now<00:00:54.480> notice<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.230> piece

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like this now notice with this piece

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.330 
like this now notice with this piece
here<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:57.180> has<00:00:57.480> studs<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
here this has studs on the side of this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.729 
here this has studs on the side of this
brick<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:00.870> able<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> couple

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
brick so here I'm able to take a couple

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.219 
brick so here I'm able to take a couple
plates<00:01:02.160> connect<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.210> together<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
plates connect them together and I can

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.990 
plates connect them together and I can
make<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.589> detailed<00:01:05.070> stripes<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.790> this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
make really detailed stripes like this

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
make really detailed stripes like this
and<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:07.049> used<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.680> Lego<00:01:08.310> Mario

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and I've used this in my Lego Mario

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
and I've used this in my Lego Mario
karts<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> I've<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:09.960> seen<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.560> applied<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
karts and I've also seen this applied to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
karts and I've also seen this applied to
some<00:01:11.310> buildings<00:01:11.729> somewhere<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.869> making<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
some buildings somewhere I was making a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
some buildings somewhere I was making a
castle<00:01:13.770> village<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.490> made<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.030> nice

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
castle village you made some really nice

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.679 
castle village you made some really nice
detailed<00:01:15.840> walls<00:01:16.140> who<00:01:16.409> using<00:01:16.979> stuff<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
detailed walls who using stuff like this

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
detailed walls who using stuff like this
you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.869> add<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> other<00:01:19.259> pieces<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you can add in other pieces as well like

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can add in other pieces as well like
for<00:01:20.460> example<00:01:20.520> maybe<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.869> bumper<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.230 

and<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:29.190> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.490> create<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.880> sorts<00:01:29.910> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and so you can create all sorts of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
and so you can create all sorts of
interesting<00:01:30.510> things<00:01:30.690> like<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:32.160> use

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
interesting things like that one use

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
interesting things like that one use
that<00:01:32.370> I've<00:01:32.670> found<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.660> I'll<00:01:34.320> probably

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that I've found for it and I'll probably

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.040 
that I've found for it and I'll probably
include<00:01:35.010> this<00:01:35.160> in<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.370> future<00:01:35.750> creations<00:01:36.750> video

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
include this in a future creations video

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.080 
include this in a future creations video
is<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.280> nice<00:01:38.850> smooth<00:01:39.540> round<00:01:39.930> walls<00:01:41.090> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is to make nice smooth round walls so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
is to make nice smooth round walls so
I've<00:01:42.180> done<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:46.010> essentially<00:01:47.010> what<00:01:47.160> I've

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I've done this essentially what I've

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580 
I've done this essentially what I've
done<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.760> I've<00:01:47.970> taken<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.690> hinge<00:01:49.020> pieces

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
done is I've taken some hinge pieces

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.570 
done is I've taken some hinge pieces
stuck<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.930> one<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.170> plates<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.369> used

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
stuck it on one of these plates and used

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.500 
stuck it on one of these plates and used
a<00:01:53.670> bunch<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> slope<00:01:54.270> pieces<00:01:54.800> now<00:01:55.800> otherwise

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
a bunch of slope pieces now otherwise

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.410 
a bunch of slope pieces now otherwise
building<00:01:57.510> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> studs<00:01:58.800> on<00:01:59.070> top<00:01:59.270> it's<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
building with the studs on top it's a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.240 
building with the studs on top it's a
lot<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.990> challenging<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> create<00:02:02.009> nice

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
lot more challenging to create nice

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.680 
lot more challenging to create nice
rounded<00:02:02.670> walls<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.509> there's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
rounded walls I don't know if there's

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.889 
rounded walls I don't know if there's
even<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.759> suppose<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.690> way<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
even a I suppose there is one way you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.870 
even a I suppose there is one way you
could<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.070> don't<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
could do this but I don't have the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.080 
could do this but I don't have the
pieces<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.880> allow<00:02:12.060> for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
pieces for that so it can allow for

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.120 
pieces for that so it can allow for
details<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> sometimes<00:02:13.470> building<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:13.980> ways

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
details and sometimes building in ways

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.210 
details and sometimes building in ways
that<00:02:14.370> normally<00:02:14.790> aren't<00:02:15.000> even<00:02:15.330> possible<00:02:16.220> it's

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that normally aren't even possible it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.710 
that normally aren't even possible it's
really<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.640> about<00:02:17.820> all<00:02:18.120> there<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> say

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
really just about all there is to say

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.500 
really just about all there is to say
about<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:20.060> it's<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.150> very<00:02:21.330> useful

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
about it really and it's a very useful

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
about it really and it's a very useful
technique<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.140> learn<00:02:22.850> chances<00:02:23.850> are<00:02:23.940> you've

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
