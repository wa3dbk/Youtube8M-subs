00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.730
 Hello everybody today, I transplant 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.730
 its course and Benjamin 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.830
 in the pot 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 more previous one and this time I 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:21.510
 I transplant it in two years at least 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 exactly and so means to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.810
 I need to transplant drainage from me 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.810
 two led enlarging transit 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.489
 and less different i use for 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:57.930
 decorative leafy plants 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 I have here two plants in one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.630
 pots and so I wanted to do more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 here is one twig I would like to cut it off 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.810
 and stick in the ground for three 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.810
 plants means 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.469
 you will need 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:41.830
 Okay, I like him so much 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.220
 cut off the twig to the tour wanted to cut 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.140
 covered with earth 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.060
 generally ficus they love big pots but 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 root system grows them myself 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:24.360
 quickly and as for the twig I mean 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:32.490
 That's the way extra leaves and that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 I will do eat such a stimulant 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.670
 rooting in if there is no charcoal 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.460
 for disinfection in general, here it is possible 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.460
 like that's the way to help and 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.800
 thus become 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.090
 ficuses are accused very quickly and in 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.110
 the ground in the water very quickly so then 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.110
 you can not even survive 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.440
 like this ficus benjamina 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.380
 transplanted and this is a ficus which I 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.810
 bred in December to wind treachery 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.730
 night small they are beautiful 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.760
 ingrained in the water now they grow in 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.310
 soil grows great while i'm still them 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.170
 I do not feed the muscles already start here 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 bought this fertilizer specifically for 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.860
 ficus so that he grows strong strong and 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.110
 healthy 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.980
 I want to say a little more about how 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.330
 form ficus to tree 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.330
 grew up need to be cut off 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.460
 side branches but for what they can then 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.180
 weave and be very pretty 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.900
 composition 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.590
 and in order to ficus was a bush 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.600
 very lush it can be cut off 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.120
 the tips then it will be exactly here 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.910
 grow in breadth will also be very beautiful 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.910
 today it's all a ficus of all good
