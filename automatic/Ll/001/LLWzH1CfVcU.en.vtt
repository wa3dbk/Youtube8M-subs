00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
know it's slow to do as long as it lines

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:43.070 
know it's slow to do as long as it lines
up<00:02:33.850> when<00:02:34.030> you're<00:02:34.150> done<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.720> matters

this<00:02:44.080> type<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.320> ask<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.830> format<00:02:45.220> material

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
this type you ask it's a format material

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.710 
this type you ask it's a format material
we<00:02:45.820> don't<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.090> clean<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:46.300> see<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:46.660> on

we don't have to clean you see we're on
it<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:48.550> button<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.650> make<00:02:50.650> sure<00:02:50.680> your

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it up just button it up make sure your

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.640 
it up just button it up make sure your
spring<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.400> there<00:02:52.380> we're<00:02:53.380> using<00:02:53.530> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
spring is in there we're using a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.390 
spring is in there we're using a
distance<00:02:54.070> Reed<00:02:54.340> valve<00:02:54.550> style<00:02:55.120> breather<00:02:56.640> again

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
distance Reed valve style breather again

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.820 
distance Reed valve style breather again
these<00:03:00.400> ones<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:02.650> got<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.770> little

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
these ones here so they got a little

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.210 
these ones here so they got a little
spring-loaded<00:03:03.190> reading<00:03:03.730> here<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:06.100> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
spring-loaded reading here so the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.290 
spring-loaded reading here so the
pressures<00:03:06.610> build<00:03:06.820> positive<00:03:07.060> hope<00:03:07.959> ins<00:03:08.170> up

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
pressures build positive hope ins up

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.100 
pressures build positive hope ins up
spring<00:03:10.300> just<00:03:10.540> keeps<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:10.900> rattling

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
spring just keeps it from rattling

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.509 
spring just keeps it from rattling
around<00:03:11.320> it's<00:03:11.650> not<00:03:11.800> engaged<00:03:12.160> with<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.340> gear

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.860 
around it's not engaged with the gear
that's<00:03:12.970> well<00:03:13.150> gonna<00:03:13.330> care<00:03:13.450> about<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.750> to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
that's well gonna care about going to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.340 
that's well gonna care about going to
Tony<00:03:14.080> month<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.480> always<00:03:16.720> double<00:03:17.110> check<00:03:17.140> just

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
Tony month so I always double check just

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.410 
Tony month so I always double check just
before<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> button<00:03:18.160> them<00:03:18.250> up<00:03:18.430> make<00:03:18.940> sure<00:03:18.970> mark

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
before I button them up make sure mark

before I button them up make sure mark
is<00:03:19.540> still<00:03:19.630> good<00:03:19.989> even<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:22.000> already<00:03:22.209> checked<00:03:22.390> it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
is still good even I already checked it

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.440 
is still good even I already checked it
three<00:03:22.690> times

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
three times

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
a high lift cam but not high enough it

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.000 
a high lift cam but not high enough it
hits<00:04:52.919> on<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.130> case<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:55.260> see<00:04:55.470> how<00:04:55.530> close<00:04:55.830> that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
hits on the case you see how close that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.740 
hits on the case you see how close that
lobe<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.430> right<00:04:56.639> there<00:04:56.910> gets<00:04:57.120> right<00:04:57.360> next<00:04:57.630> to

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750

lobe is right there gets right next to
it<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.080> know<00:05:00.050> if<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.169> hit<00:05:01.289> there<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.650> have

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
it and you know if it hit there you have

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.310 
it and you know if it hit there you have
to<00:05:01.830> grind<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.130> away
