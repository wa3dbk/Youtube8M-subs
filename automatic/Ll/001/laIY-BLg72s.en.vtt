00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.849
 Universal Soldier 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:03.399
 today is not a character 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.310
 hollywood action movies every fighter 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.669
 anti-terror should be just that 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.879
 soldiers, I give birth to him should be 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:11.259
 universal 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.259
 modules shooting complex thunderstorm 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.829
 one of the best modern designs 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 such weapons 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.259
 what could lie in such a small suitcase 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.130
 but this is most likely some sort 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.699
 musical instrument 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.609
 gaborik 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.909
 or insidious 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.429
 according to deed 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.090
 here lies 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120
 four kinds 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.010
 small arms 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.500
 here is avtoVAZ storm machine and 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.280
 rocket launchers and sniper rifle 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940
 and at the base of the complex 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.590
 everyone is well known 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.240
 Kalashnikov automatic address str true 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.470
 machine 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.150
 deeply modernized 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.400
 storm storm complex 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.070
 was born in the late eighties 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.630
 years 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.400
 Nothing like this before 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.290
 the country did not and because they could not 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.020
 it was just not necessary 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.430
 all weapons were created 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 according to the concept 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.270
 global understand three hair as possible 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.970
 more machine guns and machine guns and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.680
 handguns he could handle 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.530
 literally every 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.229
 small arms should have been 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.490
 simple reliable state order automata 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 Kalashnikov met these requirements in 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:23.790
 fully 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.640
 but times have changed soviet power 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.050
 structures began to be created 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.970
 special units 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.500
 tasks were set very different but 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.730
 weapons for their execution in squads 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.290
 spetsnaz was not Kalashnikov and not 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.330
 too fit needed urgently 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.160
 create something new but what 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.120
 the answer was suggested by the fighters themselves 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.539
 otherwise early nineties roa 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.289
 military group 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.270
 Internal Special Forces 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.460
 troop 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.409
 means kidnapped unit 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.460
 special montenegro 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 terrorism af telecom prof after 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 visits we saw a lot of different innovations 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 which pleasantly surprised us 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.580
 one of these say it was so 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 products and here 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.390
 we liked the fact that it was a junior 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 army weapon that allowed to carry 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.779
 rao fire amparo pistol cartridge 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.699
 fairy nato ammo after 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.589
 certain rework replacement 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.489
 to a large extent was in a single 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.649
 complex 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.070
 it was enough 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.499
 convenient upon arrival 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.889
 mean commander 3 troops i 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.739
 arranged a meeting 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.810
 military units 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.459
 special forces designers 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.709
 discount 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.540
 so we set out our thoughts idea 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.349
 vision and literally minimally short 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.359
 dates over several months 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.449
 appeared and 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.639
 two products of the first week it was 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.589
 machine gun cypress 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.659
 and the second week is sets back 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.180
 when creating a thunderstorm such a basis was taken 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.209
 sug windows and more compact of all 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.289
 then existing automata 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.899
 but remade it drastically myself 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.569
 the scheme has become different 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.159
 machine guns and grenade launcher 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.619
 united oao unusual for that 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:09.889
 time the letter n has improved 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.329
 balancing reduced without complex and 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.049
 reduced size 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.089
 this concept was developed and 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.919
 implemented in Tula central 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.120
 cbs sporting and hunting weapons 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.339
 as you know, any weapon is made under 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:24.799
 certain cartridge 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.849
 so at first it is completely natural 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.150
 used regular patrons such a bitch 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.399
 leader 5 and 45 millimeter 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.409
 this decision was by no means 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.819
 best especially for urban combat 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.459
 usual for special forces 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.510
 Firstly 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.720
 the bullet of this cartridge is dangerous for the very 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 arrow and civilians by chance 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 nearby 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.610
 better showed themselves bullets automatic 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.079
 chuck 7 7 years old 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.119
 eventually settled on 9 millimeter 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.709
 cartridge designed for 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.649
 sniper rifle screw cutter 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.809
 its heavy field with a low starting 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:03.039
 speed went best bounce 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.739
 she practically does not give 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.609
 modular construction 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.259
 allows you to collect 4 weapon options 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.619
 basic is small 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.069
 machine with a magazine for 20 rounds 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.039
 he has a mechanical sight 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.389
 for firing rounds at 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.389
 distances up to two hundred meters 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.689
 active scope sight for 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:23.569
 grenade launcher and attachment gifts 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.729
 including sight 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.779
 feature of this option and the storm was 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.120
 single trigger grenade launcher and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.629
 automatic rifle fire 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.389
 standard asshole millimeter 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.439
 shots apply and special gas 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.439
 guest grenade 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.769
 a layer of sand and ready for thunderstorm turns into 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:44.789
 quite simple 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.119
 enough to attach 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.009
 almost sight 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.330
 high noiseless device 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.330
 but even crouch gadgets 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.810
 practical sighting 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.889
 shooting is possible only one two hundred 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.889
 meters 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.410
 storm complex after 14 years ago so 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.870
 and not widespread 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.630
 but played a big role in the design 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.630
 melee tactics 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.560
 before this complex of Soviet and 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.689
 Russian security forces were not 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.499
 weapons arranged about visiting bullpup 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:31.559
 Now many similar systems 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.899
 but it was thunderstorm that became the first Russian 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.079
 sample of the universal 

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.439
 weapons antiterror
