this<00:00:00.359> is<00:00:00.510> zak<00:00:00.780> with<00:00:01.079> expert<00:00:01.110> village<00:00:01.949> and

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
this is zak with expert village and

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.789 
this is zak with expert village and
we've<00:00:02.639> already<00:00:02.879> talked<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.380> burning<00:00:04.380> cds

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
we've already talked about burning cds

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.419 
we've already talked about burning cds
and<00:00:05.190> dvds<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:06.060> dual<00:00:06.420> layer<00:00:06.690> dvds<00:00:07.379> but<00:00:08.099> not<00:00:08.250> all

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
and dvds and dual layer dvds but not all

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.270 
and dvds and dual layer dvds but not all
systems<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:09.120> support<00:00:09.590> all<00:00:10.590> these<00:00:11.040> different

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
systems can support all these different

right it lists the values are and RW

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
right it lists the values are and RW
this<00:01:09.299> means<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.810> write<00:01:09.990> regular<00:01:10.409> cds<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this means it can write regular cds and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.300 
this means it can write regular cds and
it<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.610> also<00:01:11.760> write<00:01:12.119> rewritable<00:01:12.750> cds

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
it can also write rewritable cds

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
it can also write rewritable cds

dvds<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.860> purchase<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.700> external<00:01:54.380> DVD

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
dvds you can purchase an external DVD

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.910 
dvds you can purchase an external DVD
drive<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.850> burn<00:01:57.469> just<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.649> any<00:01:58.860> type

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
drive that can burn just about any type

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.399 
drive that can burn just about any type
of<00:01:59.100> media<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.229> solution

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
of media and this is a good solution

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.310 
of media and this is a good solution
because<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:02.340> only<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.060> burn<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> layer

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
because not only can you burn to a layer

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.380 
because not only can you burn to a layer
or<00:02:04.680> burn<00:02:04.950> rewritable<00:02:05.579> discs<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> can

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
or burn rewritable discs but you can

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
or burn rewritable discs but you can
also<00:02:06.570> use<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.170> drive<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.770> other<00:02:07.950> computers

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
also use this drive with other computers

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
also use this drive with other computers
so<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.560> your<00:02:10.739> friend<00:02:10.979> needs<00:02:11.459> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so if you need if your friend needs to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.710 
so if you need if your friend needs to
burn<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> DVD

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
burn a DVD
