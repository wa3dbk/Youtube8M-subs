00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.500
 dear friends tell and show you 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.990
 a story that even surprised me about 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.390
 years ago my colleague is strong enough 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.400
 crashed my car skoda octavia tour 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.529
 and for six months he tried 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.689
 think up what to do with it 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.090
 as well as cheaper to recover but even with 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.169
 his abilities as a person working in 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.030
 auto business it turned out well not exactly 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.399
 making sense since recovery 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.770
 cars to perfect condition would be worth 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.739
 very expensive in the end he sold it on 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.570
 parts for 90 thousand rubles in a couple 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.660
 months to save money tired of looking 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.679
 myself a new car went the same way 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.510
 ads and browsing through one of the cars 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.820
 saw something familiar to him 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.960
 reminded to see the documents he 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.359
 I saw his name in the Title and despite 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.330
 the fact that the car was a different color from her 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.390
 there was another salon and it was sold as 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.040
 not broken and not painted 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.230
 the middleman that is the master person 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.880
 who introduced himself as the owner stood 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.070
 death that car is perfect 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.470
 condition let's go and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.390
 let's see together yes yes if you can 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.060
 show you, well, as I choose myself 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.820
 really tell me immediately was 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.509
 something out of trouble there any blows 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.869
 And so on 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.460
 no neither is it like this is nothing 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:40.659
 crash is still okay you 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 Now you know us well and the car is not young 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.780
 and such a painting her fresh seems 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.909
 that she just shines as if from 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.799
 Paint shop is understandable then 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.659
 turn signal on this side to snot 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.939
 hangs on it if you're neat 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.490
 the driver and here I see that 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.460
 such a gap 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.890
 Well, to put it mildly, the big is not quite native 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.689
 and I still get the feeling that 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.689
 can she still crash this wing 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840
 look look what's on her 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.420
 this is a gap this is not 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.660
 from the other machine part of this car too 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.010
 I watch the car seal all sitting 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.410
 crookedly and here napyl and paint visible immediately 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.050
 and you say not painted and you are the first 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.019
 the master may have come to you such a miracle 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.730
 you forgive me but I understand something 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.670
 I can not that's what is needed is not needed 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.860
 car well, here's yours 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.709
 let's keep the document clear 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.599
 documents let's see you now 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.910
 are you going to buy 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.099
 Well, let's take a look at the muscles 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.049
 it comes to buying just you me now 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.620
 I spoke on the phone with me 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.829
 about the segment 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.840
 will buy I'll bring you the way out 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:04.790
 understandable, but in 1000 the owner of the house is understandable 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.799
 will buy everything we will arrange everything all 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.690
 it will be okay but how will you respond 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.090
 if i say i know the present 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.790
 the owner of this car and knowing the story 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:27.859
 you know what happened to her so you know cho 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:29.560
 they graduated because they really wanted to take 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.400
 not good alexei 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.340
 let's try to do now 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.230
 some useful conclusion from what he saw in 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.200
 first if you come to watch cars 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.870
 turned up in garages where in one of 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.730
 garages you see some bunch strongly 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.220
 used transport 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.349
 which is clearly not very high tech 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.690
 restore then immediately worth 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.340
 think about it and this car you 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.980
 See it by chance not from there 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.630
 we left the frame is not included but 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.549
 these garages we watched 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.329
 octave was exactly so she think there and 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.880
 was restored the second is if you 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.319
 TCP do not show bear some tanks 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.049
 bye answer the third is you when 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.430
 Watch the car even if you are in it 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.489
 don't understand at all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.260
 watch carefully if the car is release 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.060
 beginnings of two thousand and she 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.430
 paintwork glitters like a 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.250
 new about what it says that the owner 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.000
 neat but u neat 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.400
 host and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.700
 there is sand and pebbles on the road near the car 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.340
 must be chipped otherwise it is painted as 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.040
 the gaps are all very easy to watch 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.080
 as far as they are symmetrical with two 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.240
 the sides were slowly in the paint but in general 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.690
 under the rubber bands in this case the car 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.930
 was green well and in conclusion can you 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.740
 say that this outbid was from 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.860
 discharge 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.560
 the most arrogant that is, it is clearly a man 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.080
 which everything is put on stream and 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.380
 this is a typical story that is when 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.940
 you show that you have at least something to see 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.190
 her at least understand something 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.610
 they just send you thanks for not 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.610
 beat up
