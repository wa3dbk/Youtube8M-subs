indie it's really really hard to work on
graphics<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> when

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
graphics like that because when you when

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
graphics like that because when you when

learning<00:02:17.349> purposes<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:19.049> what's<00:02:20.049> basically

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
learning purposes so what's basically

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.160 
learning purposes so what's basically
what's<00:02:21.700> basically<00:02:21.879> done<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.629> this<00:02:22.750> game<00:02:22.959> for

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
what's basically done in this game for

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.830 
what's basically done in this game for
the<00:02:23.200> moment<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.920> graphics<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.480> had

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
the moment is the graphics and I had

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.330 
the moment is the graphics and I had
this<00:02:25.959> little<00:02:26.200> bloom<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.950> game<00:02:27.159> which

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
this little bloom on the game which

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.309 
this little bloom on the game which
gives<00:02:27.579> the<00:02:27.700> game<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:28.239> little<00:02:28.450> more<00:02:28.599> shininess

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
gives the game a little more shininess

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.530 
gives the game a little more shininess
and<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:30.310> know<00:02:30.430> makes<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> graphics<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.239> little

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and you know makes the graphics a little

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.360 
and you know makes the graphics a little
more<00:02:31.959> optimized<00:02:32.470> I'm<00:02:32.920> actually<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.310> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
more optimized I'm actually going to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.490 
more optimized I'm actually going to
show<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.579> guys<00:02:33.790> with<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> bloom<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.379> off

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
show you guys with the bloom on and off

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.910 
show you guys with the bloom on and off
as<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.610> see<00:02:36.790> we<00:02:36.940> also<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.920> little

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
as you can see we also have a little

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.199 
as you can see we also have a little
shun<00:02:39.370> shun<00:02:40.299> Sun<00:02:41.370> refilling<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.579> reflecting

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
shun shun Sun refilling of reflecting

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.809 
shun shun Sun refilling of reflecting
and<00:02:43.510> basically<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.079> flare<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.519> we<00:02:45.670> can

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
and basically a flare so here we can

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.190 
and basically a flare so here we can
actually<00:02:45.970> change<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.510> bloom<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:46.989> I'm<00:02:47.079> gonna

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
actually change the bloom so I'm gonna

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800 
actually change the bloom so I'm gonna
change<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.519> right<00:02:48.790> now<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.329> and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
change it I have it right now on and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.949 
change it I have it right now on and
this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.470> basically<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.160> bloom<00:02:52.090> off<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.810> when

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
this is basically the bloom off and when

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.289 
this is basically the bloom off and when
I<00:02:52.989> take<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.470> on<00:02:53.620> maximus<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.700> looks<00:02:54.910> like<00:02:55.120> this

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
I take it on maximus it looks like this

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.899 
I take it on maximus it looks like this
it's<00:02:55.599> way<00:02:55.780> too<00:02:55.840> much<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.859> I<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.579> a

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
it's way too much so I have like a

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.039 
it's way too much so I have like a
little<00:02:58.750> blow<00:02:59.049> health<00:03:00.120> half<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.750> bloom

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
little blow health half of the bloom

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.089 
little blow health half of the bloom
level<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:03.099> Israel<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.510> pretty<00:03:05.140> nice<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:05.829> I

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
level so Israel is pretty nice but I

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.089 
level so Israel is pretty nice but I
think<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.730> will<00:03:06.879> decrease<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> little

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
think that I will decrease a little

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.619 
think that I will decrease a little
depending<00:03:09.099> on<00:03:09.220> what<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.489> guys<00:03:09.640> think<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.269> I

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
depending on what you guys think and I

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.630 
depending on what you guys think and I
might<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.019> also<00:03:11.440> fix<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.099> graphics

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
might have to also fix a graphics

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.360 
might have to also fix a graphics
settings<00:03:12.970> menu<00:03:13.530> which<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.680> gonna<00:03:14.829> be<00:03:15.040> where

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
settings menu which is gonna be where

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.550 
settings menu which is gonna be where
you<00:03:15.549> guys<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:16.000> change<00:03:16.329> how<00:03:16.870> much<00:03:16.989> bloom<00:03:17.290> you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you guys can change how much bloom you

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.890 
you guys can change how much bloom you
want<00:03:17.739> in<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:17.980> game<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.430> how<00:03:18.849> much<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.209> you

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
know how much the graphics are gonna be

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.180 
know how much the graphics are gonna be
detailed<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.480> game<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:22.989> yeah<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.160> it's

as I said like the creepiness of the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
as I said like the creepiness of the
game<00:03:29.680> instead<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.160> being<00:03:30.459> just<00:03:30.760> pure<00:03:31.180> like

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
game instead of being just pure like

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.080 
game instead of being just pure like
horror<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:33.310> still<00:03:33.489> gonna<00:03:33.609> be<00:03:33.790> called
