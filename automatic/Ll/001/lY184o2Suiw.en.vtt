00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.240
 we have a blender you say that you 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.240
 broke this little thing 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.090
 here is we buy the spare I think 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.090
 what is called cylinder 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:31.880
 you have to take the sample just 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.790
 this thing goes here in this arrow that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 is that is the counterpart of the part 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.990
 below nes 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.390
 these blenders last a long time 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.870
 this is composed in two parts works the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.840
 step engine but right now the way 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.910
 what 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 where you arm yourself and nothing else to 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 disarm it is reverse step 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.840
 then step number one then it is 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.570
 remove this we need a clamp 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.150
 pressure like this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 give it enough openness to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.890
 moor here 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.470
 and with a clamp 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.900
 mechanical or electrical 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.500
 we loosened 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 the ulna this popsicles callers 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 this is new just buy it 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.390
 but when it comes to changing it, it's 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 part no longer resisted 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.820
 it's already loose I take it off with my hand 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.820
 and here is 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.140
 and this is the part that remains 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 so 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.979
 they suggested to me to put a little grace 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 to heaven 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.100
 the cylinder 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.890
 so before we put a little bit of 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.690
 fat 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.070
 the die is put here on it 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.070
 in the middle half is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.240
 Y 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.240
 it is screwed here 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.700
 I'm going to use both hands to screw 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.460
 it is screwed until it arrives because the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 force is going to give when 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.090
 when it is screwed here to the arrow to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.090
 motor shaft 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.020
 good is necessary to mention that here 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.770
 as engine bases we have or rings 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.170
 that allow some suspension to the 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.040
 motor is a no ring 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.040
 for each screw 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.090
 1 ring for each screw 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.100
 3 and 4 for the time that I disarmed and 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.710
 your urine falls, do not scare 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.020
 rings go from the side that at the time of 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.380
 You put it on your head right now 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.280
 is for itself when it comes to putting it you're going to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.010
 have to turn 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.180
 this 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.780
 and flip the engine 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.780
 yes 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.879
 then we also have these pieces 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.780
 which are the ones that go from the side of 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.569
 of the rings 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.460
 and are the ones that are going to hold the motor 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.770
 we have to have four each 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.880
 with his each one Ivan in this way alone 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.880
 upwards 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.069
 on this side that 's why it 's recommended 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.830
 put them since you are going to install the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.810
 engine in place 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.900
 if we have three here and here we have 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.519
 one that was lost 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.519
 and this one would have 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.930
 and we already have 4 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.500
 now let's take out this piece for 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.260
 take out this piece we need 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.960
 already the gardens fell 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.960
 bind this press it 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.150
 to see what I think with a piece 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:35.830
 of pressure and with with the mechanical clamp 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.830
 we loose it 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:43.960
 or we are going to put a screwdriver 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:47.840
 which actors are the blades 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.699
 and with depression we get this out 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.060
 and now I'm going to see what is best 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.449
 you 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.419
 it fits and well here 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.270
 and I already tried in just to put the clip 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.750
 of pressure 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:08.230
 here where was the little bit of the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:10.150
 cylinder is a cylinder that is 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.330
 which is surrounded by rubber and in its 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.700
 ends has metal has the ropes 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.200
 in a bullet arrow of the engine 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.830
 and in the other they are given 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.529
 that goes to the stars of those of the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.559
 blades 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.119
 then apparently it is not used 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:31.279
 a lot of strength 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.019
 just with holding firmly with 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:36.499
 the hand if you can put on a glove of 

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:40.150
 meat up those held in this way and 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:43.650
 they are loosening little by little with the hand 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.650
 and you are making it stronger 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.029
 ah
