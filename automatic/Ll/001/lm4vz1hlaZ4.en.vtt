exclusively<00:00:25.279> on<00:00:26.279> eHow<00:00:26.430> home<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> guess<00:00:28.199> what

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
exclusively on eHow home so guess what

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
exclusively on eHow home so guess what
this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.920> yeah<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.090> doesn't<00:00:30.240> look<00:00:30.390> like

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this is yeah I know it doesn't look like

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.810 
this is yeah I know it doesn't look like
a<00:00:30.689> hot<00:00:30.960> water<00:00:31.199> heater<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.669> not

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a hot water heater but it is it's not

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
a hot water heater but it is it's not
the<00:00:32.969> conventional<00:00:33.570> tank<00:00:33.899> type<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the conventional tank type this is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
the conventional tank type this is
tankless<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.940> reason<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.780> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
tankless and the reason we have it is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.930 
tankless and the reason we have it is
because<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.890> cuts<00:00:38.129> down<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> cost

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
because it really cuts down on the cost

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.720 
because it really cuts down on the cost
of<00:00:39.600> energy<00:00:40.140> remember<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.460> about

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
of energy remember we're all about

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.790 
of energy remember we're all about
saving<00:00:42.180> energy<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.840> house<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.710> I've

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
saving energy with this house now I've

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
saving energy with this house now I've
been<00:00:43.920> familiar<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.399> these<00:00:44.640> tankless<00:00:45.149> hot

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
been familiar with these tankless hot

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.330 
been familiar with these tankless hot
water<00:00:45.390> heaters<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.200> some<00:00:46.410> time<00:00:46.710> I've<00:00:47.280> used

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
water heaters for some time I've used

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
water heaters for some time I've used
them<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.850> several<00:00:48.239> projects<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> first

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
them on several projects but I first

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900 
them on several projects but I first
learned<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:49.980> from<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.399> friends<00:00:50.789> in

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
learned about them from some friends in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
learned about them from some friends in
Europe<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.930> uses<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Europe this is what they uses to the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
Europe this is what they uses to the
standard<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.340> Europe<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> energy

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
standard in Europe because of the energy

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.529 
standard in Europe because of the energy
efficiency<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> tankless<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.910> doesn't<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
efficiency the tankless it doesn't it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.459 
efficiency the tankless it doesn't it
doesn't<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.989> run<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.430> unless<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
doesn't really run you know unless it's

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
doesn't really run you know unless it's
