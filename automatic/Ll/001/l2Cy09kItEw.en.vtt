00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:14.639
 Hello Love YouTube is here is the case and today is a fine of one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.780
 Marburg lie 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.970
 and indeed the spider is man 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.349
 he has 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.919
 no youtube channel will be available soon but could not do anything 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.460
 but now to go he plays with Dr 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.900
 Command with silencers 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.319
 has Salzburg looter pro 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
 nationwide Michael Krohn is the latter has more 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 Marathon Fro think I think so 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.220
 probably yes 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.200
 on 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.060
 good then his gestures are 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.690
 with the relatively low and that way with plans next 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.030
 Dr Northeim Strike 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.300
 and then last as yet on the occasion of Haupter 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.310
 but none give HÃ¤upl to Judith as relatively good and that's just fine 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.340
 Billions in me 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.730
 and then we come to the current topic 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.250
 and I want a little bit more about the silencer today 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.270
 to the number of patients 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.500
 good for what do you need the muffler your own 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.750
 Muffler used in the best way for 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.010
 Practical player does not want to be recognized in the wall 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.850
 ScanMail the muffler 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.910
 dampens the shots off already the name says and 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.290
 As a result, the shots are quieter but just Alban can not stand up 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.600
 no definite so 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.070
 she keeps the distance down 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.590
 practically around 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.240
 It brings two games such as Cerci's loyalty 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.180
 3 percent of what's left to play there is really that's how it is 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.840
 if you travel per night so if you play normally you do not want to be recognized 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.270
 that means if I'm anywhere now 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.850
 Rainer m Shears but now and then I have the dignity and I do not want to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.020
 that I can see the one immediately on the one and then 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.500
 it's quite good 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 Choosing it well then was crucial again 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 Dr is best if you are in the different 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.720
 For example, classes are linked to different tracks, for example, if one 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.549
 has now 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.519
 for example, big with big chamber that connect well 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.149
 49 um and what still despite 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.369
 but practically in winter Classic to two weak grandparents 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.709
 nimbly over 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.739
 with the hand or something and 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.570
 then 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.249
 around the percent Menzer one 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.699
 that one stops a hundred quiet and one is not recognized at all 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.699
 this is definitely something 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:36.199
 relatively well I myself did not play with the muffler no matter what the game 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.659
 Like him, he rarely had to dab white damage from the weapon 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.710
 Fast Caputh process quickly breaks down no less 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.710
 while the damage goes through the reverse 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.509
 greatly reduced during the approx 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.340
 and how can give 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.910
 Not so easy Rennie one-on-one duel for less 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.439
 not so easy to rent 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.509
 like Brunner 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:04.979
 Form void the sound of Apple jokes so boring then and but it 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.279
 Everyone can decide for themselves 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.619
 in every game but in Search is highly recommended today I have 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:11.059
 say 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:15.299
 and then we realized that you have HD games available 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.099
 and 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.279
 yes, I bought the holy fire 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.199
 who 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.529
 they want 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.879
 So who wants the settings formal percent Roman shots of recording from 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.699
 AMS Sony Vegas 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.069
 around the probe 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.069
 in Massachusetts and I'll be easy 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.779
 stretch 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.999
 who tells the world quite differently to the bay 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.749
 I did that 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:45.010
 yes and then I have recently uploaded my test video Aachen could 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.719
 about half an hour were already critics and above 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.479
 which movie in general that salaries 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.920
 to Dr 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.409
 It is therefore comfortable 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.499
 old people could be shared 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.049
 that the policy states it and me on our Commentary bulk other 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.469
 that's an argument not entirely up to you by your parents 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.779
 otherwise 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.269
 I can tell you for debate like these two years 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.819
 and 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.419
 Euro which I totally cool by runs 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.150
 Make discoveries on the side 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.760
 yes this is the policy Nasers wanted the test is the percent that is around the 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.430
 Love for the Blader Blanc but that does not have so many people would come then 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.760
 but still and we give the cowshed was locked 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.580
 to offer as 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.250
 he had otherwise 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.479
 i think i pulled policy target currently off pretty well 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.009
 for the Opel Commodore and that we want to be able to do it now and 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.710
 then find 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.200
 soon we will not take place soon there will be the highlights 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.910
 Dr Sniper Monza quickly stayed by the sniper Grace Lei Polo and indeed 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.380
 it looks like this is part of it 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.770
 from the first part but the second place not in the best age 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.310
 is posted at the fifa poll and the second temporary breakup is 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.449
 because we are leading the lobby together 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.250
 and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.270
 we just do it so we are looking forward to Durach and looking for it 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.039
 a bridge like this 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.539
 and we just take it for one 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.539
 for one and adware 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:16.900
 Dialect value 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.990
 and it will be inferior to music all over Poland and so on and La Plata and 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:25.770
 Blur cook friend's contrary 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.150
 and 2 though one 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.879
 Balance in front 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.469
 I did not apply 33 believe me and I thought to look 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.889
 first Barth explains an IGS
