00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.839 

I<00:00:08.030> think<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.769> country<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.950> environmentally

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
I think our country is environmentally

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
I think our country is environmentally
way<00:00:12.300> behind<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.019> part<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.650> has<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.130> with

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
way behind and part of it has to do with

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.790 
way behind and part of it has to do with
education<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.240> feel<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.199> extremely

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
education I feel that it's extremely

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.870

important<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.340> environmental

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
important to have environmental

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.029 
important to have environmental
education<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> classroom<00:00:19.039> environmental

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
education in the classroom environmental

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.650 
education in the classroom environmental
education<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.640> lacking<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.090> classroom<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
education is lacking the classroom and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.410 
education is lacking the classroom and
that<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.199> no<00:00:22.820> specific<00:00:23.820> curriculum

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
that there is no specific curriculum

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
that there is no specific curriculum
available<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.320> addresses<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070

available that addresses the
environmental<00:00:26.519> education<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.240> believe<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
environmental education I believe that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
environmental education I believe that
environmental<00:00:28.380> education<00:00:29.039> should<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.369> taught

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
environmental education should be taught

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150 
environmental education should be taught
right<00:00:29.880> along<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.330> health<00:00:30.949> education<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
right along with health education and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.299 
right along with health education and
science<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.290> personally<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.649> need<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.160> do

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
science I personally think we need to do

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
science I personally think we need to do
more<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> consistently<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.649> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
more of it consistently and have it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.010 
more of it consistently and have it
adopted<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.489> part<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:39.000> state<00:00:39.239> program<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
adopted as part of our state program I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
adopted as part of our state program I
do<00:00:40.290> believe<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> should<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
do believe it should be part of the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
do believe it should be part of the
standards<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.960> bottom<00:00:43.800> line

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
standards because I think bottom line

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
standards because I think bottom line
it's<00:00:44.219> saving<00:00:44.489> our<00:00:44.730> earth<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.539> environmental

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's saving our earth that environmental

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's saving our earth that environmental
education<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:46.980> definitely<00:00:47.550> help<00:00:47.760> everyone

having<00:00:49.110> environmental<00:00:49.739> education<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
having environmental education in the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
having environmental education in the

using the game saving the earth for for
several<00:03:37.410> years<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.980> my<00:03:38.100> teaching<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.230> think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
several years with my teaching I think

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.280 
several years with my teaching I think
they're<00:03:40.410> definitely<00:03:40.650> more<00:03:41.190> aware<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:42.109> what<00:03:43.109> to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
they're definitely more aware of what to

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.069 
they're definitely more aware of what to
recycle<00:03:43.709> why<00:03:44.459> we're<00:03:44.730> recycling<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.750> mean<00:03:45.930> we

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
recycle why we're recycling I mean we

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.509 
recycle why we're recycling I mean we
talk<00:03:46.320> about<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.739> all<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.859> time<00:03:46.980> put<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
talk about it all the time put it in the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.580 
talk about it all the time put it in the
recycle<00:03:48.000> bin<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.299> say<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.900> daily<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.380> this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

recycle bin I say that daily in this
classroom<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.510> if<00:03:51.720> they<00:03:51.870> are

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019

so<00:03:52.470> aware<00:03:53.070> than<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:53.459> they<00:03:53.700> used<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.150> yeah
