got fuel in it and I have been for ride
on<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> exhaust<00:01:34.560> system<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.130> those

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
on it and the exhaust system also those

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
on it and the exhaust system also those
it's<00:01:35.909> pretty<00:01:36.210> good<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:40.040> both<00:01:41.040> sides

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it's pretty good to see that both sides

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's pretty good to see that both sides
of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> tank<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> detail<00:01:42.869> Fisher

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
of the tank you see in the detail Fisher

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
of the tank you see in the detail Fisher
they<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.619> fuzzy<00:01:43.920> around<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> corner

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
they look a bit fuzzy around the corner

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.389 
they look a bit fuzzy around the corner
there's<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:44.970> fuel<00:01:45.329> leaks<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.720> anything<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
there's no fuel leaks or anything but it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.560 
there's no fuel leaks or anything but it
obviously<00:01:47.520> does<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.240> bit

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
obviously does look a little bit

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.149 
obviously does look a little bit
more<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.260> core<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:51.890> there<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.040> go

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
more in the core of that there we go

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.590 
more in the core of that there we go
under<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.550> match<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> point<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
under the match has to point out on the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.110 
under the match has to point out on the
bike<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.990> some<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.220> its<00:01:56.370> fall<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.880> needs

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
bike in some it's got its fall to needs

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.390 
bike in some it's got its fall to needs
a<00:01:57.270> gear<00:01:57.600> sorting<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.260> but<00:01:58.530> basically<00:01:59.070> it's

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
a gear sorting out but basically it's

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.430 
a gear sorting out but basically it's
all<00:01:59.580> there<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.420> wheel<00:02:00.630> bearings<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.260> good

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
all there the wheel bearings are good

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.260 
all there the wheel bearings are good
the<00:02:01.590> rear<00:02:01.770> suspension<00:02:02.340> seems<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> dance

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the rear suspension seems like it dance

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
the rear suspension seems like it dance
properly<00:02:03.659> both<00:02:04.050> ways<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:07.250> just<00:02:08.250> need

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
properly both ways it's just need

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.360 
properly both ways it's just need
somebody<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:10.500> all<00:02:10.679> those<00:02:10.860> gears<00:02:11.100> so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
somebody to that this all those gears so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.870 
somebody to that this all those gears so
there<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.760> good<00:02:12.240> luck<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.570> bidding
