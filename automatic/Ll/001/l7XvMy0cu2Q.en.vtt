00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.070
 we see everyone here today 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.869
 I have the chance to even try 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 a fifty good a fifty I 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.619
 wanted you who was slightly 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.300
 modified but it's more or less the same 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 system normally gefflaut speed which 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 will join me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 with the donkey fair but before that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 if it happens, we'll see a little description 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 here was good in the saddle is a little more 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 lasts that the transalp is logical the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.289
 suspension is a bit shorter but 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.120
 we will see what it gives but the 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:44.820
 difference is that here lcd marc aupic 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 not necessarily advantages on 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 do not clutter a battery and that's it 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.570
 on the other hand no speedometer 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 by weight sensors so it does not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 must do with 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 so here I know I can not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.309
 neutral I did not know the whole thing to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.480
 the time I'm really looking for no 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.070
 the more we will do a little tour 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.070
 and we'll see what she's up to 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.159
 at the acceleration level for it takes 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 to have time 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.840
 I remind you that it has been modified 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.250
 that makes me say I mean she can 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 go to 75 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.940
 otherwise we would not imagine it would be like 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940
 shitting 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.180
 here is this on flers invitation 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.180
 serbia 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.910
 here I think I'm at 80 then 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.890
 obvious braking level 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.909
 the planet the brake pedal is a bit 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.799
 hard to reach 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.799
 to really have little feet 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.860
 Oh 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.730
 quinon acceleration for the city goes this 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.730
 enough to move 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.400
 it's funny 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.650
 bush like a bike 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.650
 it goes at a speed exactly from 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 same way they motors 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.480
 I think it also exists in semi 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480
 automatic 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.920
 stable faye but it's relatively 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 stable 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.190
 you have beautiful 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.190
 I know 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.690
 otherwise the saddle she is really hard to 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690
 Earth 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 Oh 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.820
 at the maneuverability level good we saw 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.220
 just now we can turn back 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.090
 relatively easily 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.270
 for those who want to pass their license 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.270
 do the 8 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.280
 Friday it seems to be pretty 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.280
 handy 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.760
 he 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.760
 to look for the real brake 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.690
 less obvious hello and big feet 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.980
 in a little big for this bike here is 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.090
 be fun 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.090
 you bring her back to her owner 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.940
 gold against the fidji flirt 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.610
 we will ask them 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.870
 let's go good this must crisis 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.990
 I do what I can with that 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.990
 I have 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.880
 good if not when it's 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.210
 comfortable another level but 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.040
 having fun and when we understood with the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.040
 gear changes that's fine 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.060
 and here is how to comment on 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.820
 give your opinion if you like or not 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.270
 the 50 years before that took me but hey 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.790
 everyday 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.590
 the highway we forget national no 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.040
 obvious and the perfect boss city one 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.960
 fun 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.960
 Have a good day of good rotations
