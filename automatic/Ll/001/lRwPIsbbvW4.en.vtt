here today is gonna be my review of the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.730 
here today is gonna be my review of the
fangshi<00:00:04.950> Gwangyang<00:00:11.540> alright<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.259> unbox

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
fangshi Gwangyang alright so i unbox

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.220 
fangshi Gwangyang alright so i unbox
this<00:00:13.920> cube<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.880> over<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> week<00:00:15.420> ago<00:00:15.750> maybe

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
this cube a little over a week ago maybe

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
this cube a little over a week ago maybe
a<00:00:16.379> little<00:00:16.560> less<00:00:16.800> I'm<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.340> sure<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
a little less I'm not sure but if you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
a little less I'm not sure but if you
guys<00:00:18.840> remember<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.920> quarter<00:00:20.279> cutting<00:00:20.670> was

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
guys remember the quarter cutting was

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.300 
guys remember the quarter cutting was
really<00:00:21.330> bad<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> box<00:00:22.320> let's<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
really bad out of the box let's take a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
really bad out of the box let's take a
look<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.609> corner<00:00:23.880> cutting<00:00:24.090> we'll<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
look at corner cutting we'll just go to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.150 
look at corner cutting we'll just go to
45<00:00:26.180> no<00:00:28.580> actually<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.500> piece<00:00:31.500> takes<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.009> little

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
45 no actually a piece takes a little

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
45 no actually a piece takes a little
bit<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> effort<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.059> let's<00:00:33.239> try<00:00:33.420> another<00:00:33.540> side

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
bit of effort so let's try another side

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.690 
bit of effort so let's try another side
maybe<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.230> tensioning<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.940> no<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> not

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
maybe it's tensioning and no so not

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
maybe it's tensioning and no so not
necessarily<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> best<00:00:39.780> corner<00:00:40.140> cutting<00:00:40.350> out

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
necessarily the best corner cutting out

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.319 
necessarily the best corner cutting out
of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> box<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.520> since<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.030> I've<00:00:42.149> actually

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
of the box but since then I've actually

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.990 
of the box but since then I've actually
taken<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> cube<00:00:43.260> apart<00:00:43.590> had<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> remove<00:00:44.550> just

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
taken the cube apart had to remove just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
taken the cube apart had to remove just
a<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.539> bit<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> flesh<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:47.219> lubed<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a little bit of flesh and I lubed the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.479 
a little bit of flesh and I lubed the
core<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> lube

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
core and I put just a little bit of lube

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
core and I put just a little bit of lube
on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> pieces<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.350> guys<00:00:52.559> if

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
on the pieces so I know you guys if

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.229 
on the pieces so I know you guys if
you're<00:00:53.010> familiar<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.460> things<00:00:53.789> she<00:00:53.879> know

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you're familiar with things she know

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
you're familiar with things she know
that<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:55.050> perform<00:00:55.440> pretty<00:00:55.590> well

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that they actually perform pretty well

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.029 
that they actually perform pretty well
dry<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> cubes<00:00:58.320> made<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
dry but I think this cubes made out of a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.380 
dry but I think this cubes made out of a
different<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.640> plastic<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
different kind of plastic and it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
different kind of plastic and it
actually<00:01:00.750> responds<00:01:01.170> pretty<00:01:01.859> well<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
actually responds pretty well to a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
actually responds pretty well to a
little<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.090> lubrication<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
little bit of lubrication so I want to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
little bit of lubrication so I want to
show<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> guys<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:05.159> since<00:01:06.030> I've<00:01:06.270> actually

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
show you guys now since I've actually

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.800 
show you guys now since I've actually
taken<00:01:07.590> care<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.040> cube<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.820> cuts<00:01:09.299> 45

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
taken care of this cube it cuts 45

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
taken care of this cube it cuts 45
pretty<00:01:10.619> easily<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.549> maybe<00:01:11.909> even<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> little

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pretty easily and maybe even a little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.609 
pretty easily and maybe even a little
bit<00:01:13.020> over<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.820> reverse<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.990> little

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
bit over and reverse is about a little

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
bit over and reverse is about a little
less<00:01:16.979> than<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> piece<00:01:17.490> still<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> think

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
less than a piece still but I think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
less than a piece still but I think
reverse<00:01:19.140> corner<00:01:19.409> cutting<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.009> design

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
reverse corner cutting is more design

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.570 
reverse corner cutting is more design
than<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> setup<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.350> anyway<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.460> know

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
than it is setup but anyway you know

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
than it is setup but anyway you know
almost<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.180> full<00:01:24.360> piece<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.530> cube<00:01:25.860> has

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
almost a full piece so this cube has

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.300 
almost a full piece so this cube has
been<00:01:26.520> performing<00:01:27.090> extremely<00:01:27.840> well<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
been performing extremely well this is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.649 
been performing extremely well this is
basically<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.000> I've<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.240> using<00:01:30.479> for

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
basically all that I've been using for

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
basically all that I've been using for
the<00:01:30.960> last<00:01:31.170> week<00:01:31.470> aside<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.850> couple<00:01:33.090> new

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the last week aside from a couple new

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
the last week aside from a couple new
puzzles<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> got<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:35.159> super

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
puzzles that I got and I'm super

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
puzzles that I got and I'm super
impressed<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> performance<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> this

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
impressed with the performance of this

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140 
impressed with the performance of this
but<00:01:37.590> before<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.250> showing<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> all

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but before I get into showing you all

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
but before I get into showing you all
how<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.540> cube<00:01:39.810> performed<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.560> me<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
how this cube performed for me I want to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
how this cube performed for me I want to
show<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> differences<00:01:42.329> between<00:01:42.390> this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
show you the differences between this

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260 
show you the differences between this
and<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.380> Schwinger<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.860> version<00:01:44.250> 2<00:01:44.460> alright

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and the Schwinger in version 2 alright

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
and the Schwinger in version 2 alright
so<00:01:45.420> taking<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> edge<00:01:46.229> pieces<00:01:46.590> here

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so taking a look at the edge pieces here

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
so taking a look at the edge pieces here
you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> Gwangyang<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you can see that the Gwangyang is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
you can see that the Gwangyang is
actually<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.170> narrower<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
actually a little narrower here and a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.810 
actually a little narrower here and a
little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.840> taller<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:53.220> looking<00:01:53.640> from

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
little bit taller if you're looking from

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.469 
little bit taller if you're looking from
the<00:01:53.939> base<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> point<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.479> that's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the base to the point there so that's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.069 
the base to the point there so that's
new<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.469> whole<00:01:59.000> torpedo<00:02:00.000> design<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
new and the whole torpedo design here is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.480 
new and the whole torpedo design here is
actually<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:01.979> smaller<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
actually a little bit smaller on the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
actually a little bit smaller on the
Gwangyang<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> still<00:02:03.540> doesn't<00:02:03.810> pop<00:02:04.140> at

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
Gwangyang but it still doesn't pop at

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.819 
Gwangyang but it still doesn't pop at
all<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.810> changes<00:02:07.049> from<00:02:07.590> this

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
all and there are some changes from this

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.639 
all and there are some changes from this
view<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.220> well<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.319> whole

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
view as well you can see that this whole

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.390 
view as well you can see that this whole
piece<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.569> more<00:02:12.720> narrow<00:02:12.959> on

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
piece is a little bit more narrow on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.770 
piece is a little bit more narrow on
so<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.909> little<00:02:14.090> bit<00:02:14.209> more<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.540> sleep

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so it's a little bit more of a sleep

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.619 
so it's a little bit more of a sleep
design<00:02:15.170> but<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> overall<00:02:16.340> design<00:02:16.760> concept<00:02:17.510> is

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
design but the overall design concept is

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.420 
design but the overall design concept is
the<00:02:17.750> same<00:02:17.989> there<00:02:18.530> are<00:02:18.650> two<00:02:18.799> pieces<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.159> fit

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
the same there are two pieces that fit

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.970 
the same there are two pieces that fit
together<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.360> in<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.870> Shuang<00:02:21.470> Ren<00:02:21.709> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
together just like in the Shuang Ren and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.399 
together just like in the Shuang Ren and
then<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> cap<00:02:22.519> fits<00:02:22.849> over<00:02:23.180> them<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.989> if<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
then the cap fits over them so if you

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.020 
then the cap fits over them so if you
don't<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.099> fact<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.489> there's<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.760> cap

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
don't like the fact that there's a cap

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.850 
don't like the fact that there's a cap
on<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> pieces<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:27.260> still<00:02:27.530> wouldn't<00:02:27.739> like

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
on the pieces you still wouldn't like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.530 
on the pieces you still wouldn't like
this<00:02:28.010> design<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.879> feels<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.269> lot<00:02:29.480> different

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
this design but it feels a lot different

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690 
this design but it feels a lot different
with<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.530> corners<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.129> kind<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.519> same

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
with the corners it's kind of the same

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.910 
with the corners it's kind of the same
story<00:02:32.030> very<00:02:32.930> similar<00:02:33.079> as<00:02:33.680> far<00:02:33.709> as

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
story very similar as far as

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.399 
story very similar as far as
construction<00:02:34.370> goes<00:02:34.790> you've<00:02:35.540> got<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.049> cap

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
construction goes you've got the cap

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.460 
construction goes you've got the cap
over<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.280> single<00:02:38.090> piece<00:02:38.569> here<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:39.319> this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
over the single piece here and then this

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.649 
over the single piece here and then this
piece<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.890> separate<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.120> stalk<00:02:41.450> is

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
piece is separate but the stalk is

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.140 
piece is separate but the stalk is
actually<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.049> little<00:02:42.319> longer<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.670> base<00:02:43.909> is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
actually a little longer and the base is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.110 
actually a little longer and the base is
a<00:02:44.180> little<00:02:44.510> smaller<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.200> think<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:46.129> provides<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a little smaller I think it provides the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.569 
a little smaller I think it provides the
better<00:02:47.359> feel<00:02:47.780> there's<00:02:48.470> there's<00:02:48.890> more<00:02:49.069> room<00:02:49.370> in

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
better feel there's there's more room in

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.490 
better feel there's there's more room in
the<00:02:49.700> cube<00:02:50.000> for<00:02:50.269> pieces<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.690> move<00:02:50.840> around<00:02:50.959> and

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
the cube for pieces to move around and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.800 
the cube for pieces to move around and
it's<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.129> little<00:02:52.250> bit<00:02:52.459> less<00:02:52.640> lucky<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.390> now<00:02:53.780> I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
it's a little bit less lucky and now I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.509 
it's a little bit less lucky and now I
know<00:02:53.989> it's<00:02:54.260> kind<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.590> hard<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.859> see<00:02:55.069> on<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
know it's kind of hard to see on the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.440 
know it's kind of hard to see on the
black<00:02:55.730> cube<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.319> actual<00:02:58.269> mechanism<00:02:59.269> is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
black cube but the actual mechanism is

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.630 
black cube but the actual mechanism is
pretty<00:02:59.959> similar<00:03:00.319> they've<00:03:00.920> added<00:03:01.400> these

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
pretty similar they've added these

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.699 
pretty similar they've added these
pieces<00:03:02.030> right<00:03:02.390> here<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.750> guess<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.319> give<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
pieces right here I guess to give it a

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.280 
pieces right here I guess to give it a
smoother<00:03:04.250> feel<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.849> a<00:03:05.329> faster<00:03:05.750> feel<00:03:05.989> and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
smoother feel and a faster feel and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.490 
smoother feel and a faster feel and
believe<00:03:06.890> me<00:03:07.040> this<00:03:07.190> cube<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.670> crazy<00:03:08.060> fast<00:03:08.500> but

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
believe me this cube is crazy fast but

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500 
believe me this cube is crazy fast but
everything<00:03:10.220> else<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.670> pretty<00:03:10.730> much<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.329> same

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
everything else is pretty much the same

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.869 
everything else is pretty much the same
the<00:03:12.049> piece<00:03:12.290> under<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.799> center<00:03:13.129> is<00:03:13.310> actually

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
the piece under the center is actually

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.449 
the piece under the center is actually
separate<00:03:14.359> from<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.379> actual<00:03:15.680> part<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.340> has

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
separate from the actual part that has

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.390 
separate from the actual part that has
the<00:03:16.489> cap<00:03:16.819> on<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.989> same<00:03:18.200> core<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.919> it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
the cap on it and the same core and it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.729 
the cap on it and the same core and it
looks<00:03:19.669> pretty<00:03:19.910> similar<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.319> feels

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
looks pretty similar but it feels

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.800 
looks pretty similar but it feels
totally<00:03:22.130> different<00:03:22.819> now<00:03:23.209> one<00:03:23.389> thing<00:03:23.599> that's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
totally different now one thing that's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.390 
totally different now one thing that's
noticeably<00:03:24.349> different<00:03:24.470> about<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:25.069> cube

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
noticeably different about this cube

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.490 
noticeably different about this cube
from<00:03:25.669> the<00:03:25.790> Shuang<00:03:26.000> R<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.180> version<00:03:26.510> 2<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
from the Shuang R in version 2 is the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.860 
from the Shuang R in version 2 is the
feel<00:03:27.799> even<00:03:28.639> out<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.060> box<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.599> cube

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
feel even out of the box this cube

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.800 
feel even out of the box this cube
didn't<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.859> scratchy<00:03:31.700> feel<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.629> we've

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
didn't have the scratchy feel that we've

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020 
didn't have the scratchy feel that we've
come<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.109> be<00:03:33.739> used<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.160> with<00:03:34.400> fangshi<00:03:34.760> cubes

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
come to be used to with fangshi cubes

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.690 
come to be used to with fangshi cubes
and<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:36.139> kind<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.010> know<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.370> lot<00:03:37.579> of

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
and I kind of like that I know a lot of

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.369 
and I kind of like that I know a lot of
people<00:03:37.940> like<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.450> scratchy<00:03:38.750> feel<00:03:39.109> that's

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
people like to that scratchy feel that's

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.650 
people like to that scratchy feel that's
kind<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.650> what<00:03:39.799> they<00:03:39.950> came<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> associate<00:03:41.480> with

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
kind of what they came to associate with

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.689 
kind of what they came to associate with
a<00:03:41.720> fangshi<00:03:42.199> puzzle<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.099> I<00:03:43.160> think<00:03:43.549> they've

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
a fangshi puzzle but I think they've

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.159 
a fangshi puzzle but I think they've
stepped<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.359> kind<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.660> plastic<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.109> they

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
stepped up the kind of plastic that they

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.439 
stepped up the kind of plastic that they
use<00:03:45.500> or<00:03:45.799> at<00:03:46.099> least<00:03:46.280> changed<00:03:46.699> it<00:03:46.849> because<00:03:47.209> it

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
use or at least changed it because it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.780 
use or at least changed it because it
feels<00:03:47.660> much<00:03:48.319> better<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.859> me<00:03:49.010> although<00:03:49.280> this

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
feels much better to me although this

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.420 
feels much better to me although this
cube<00:03:50.060> does<00:03:50.269> retain<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.989> kind<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.650> ratalie<00:03:52.220> a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
cube does retain that kind of ratalie a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.819 
cube does retain that kind of ratalie a
little<00:03:52.970> bit<00:03:53.060> loud<00:03:53.449> sound<00:03:54.019> that<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.349> get<00:03:54.590> with

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
little bit loud sound that you get with

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:04.230 
little bit loud sound that you get with
most<00:03:55.040> famed<00:03:55.370> sheet<00:03:55.519> cubes<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:55.940> listen

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.910 

you<00:04:05.240> know<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.660> tell<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.230> there's<00:04:06.770> a<00:04:06.890> lot

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
you know you can tell that there's a lot

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
you know you can tell that there's a lot
of<00:04:07.070> moving<00:04:07.280> pieces<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.810> kind<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:09.940> snaps

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
of moving pieces and it kind of snaps

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.210 
of moving pieces and it kind of snaps
into<00:04:11.300> place<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> lot<00:04:12.080> and<00:04:12.350> it's<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.950> little<00:04:13.130> bit

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
into place a lot and it's a little bit

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.590 
into place a lot and it's a little bit
clacking<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:13.790> that's<00:04:13.970> not<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.180> big<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.480> a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
clacking but that's not that big of a

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.720 
clacking but that's not that big of a
deal<00:04:14.810> especially<00:04:15.680> if<00:04:15.800> you<00:04:15.950> like<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.459> feel

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
deal especially if you like that feel

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.390 
deal especially if you like that feel
because<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:18.080> sound<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.500> cube<00:04:18.769> isn't<00:04:19.190> going

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
because the sound of a cube isn't going

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.100 
because the sound of a cube isn't going
to<00:04:19.549> deter<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.000> from<00:04:20.030> using<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.600> if<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.720> really

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
to deter you from using it if you really

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.140 
to deter you from using it if you really
enjoy<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.739> would<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.920> recommend<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.550> cube<00:04:22.820> if

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
enjoy so would I recommend this cube if

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.600 
enjoy so would I recommend this cube if
you<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:23.540> fangshi<00:04:23.990> cubes<00:04:24.320> definitely<00:04:25.310> this

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
you like fangshi cubes definitely this

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.570 
you like fangshi cubes definitely this
is<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:26.270> best<00:04:27.260> performing<00:04:27.830> fengxi<00:04:28.220> cube<00:04:28.460> that

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
is the best performing fengxi cube that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.310 
is the best performing fengxi cube that
i've<00:04:28.730> ever<00:04:28.760> used<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.780> honest<00:04:30.020> with<00:04:30.140> you<00:04:30.290> I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
i've ever used to be honest with you I

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.440 
i've ever used to be honest with you I
had<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.860> version<00:04:31.610> one<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.120> used<00:04:32.330> it

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
had the version one and I used it

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.440 
had the version one and I used it
forever<00:04:32.660> after<00:04:33.290> my<00:04:33.410> zhanchi<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.130> then<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:34.940> had

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
forever after my zhanchi and then I had

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.720 
forever after my zhanchi and then I had
the<00:04:36.050> version<00:04:36.410> two<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.830> traded<00:04:37.220> for<00:04:37.370> at<00:04:37.700> a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
the version two that I traded for at a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.320 
the version two that I traded for at a
competition<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:39.040> above<00:04:40.040> all<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.520> those<00:04:40.700> this

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
competition so above all of those this

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.510 
competition so above all of those this
one<00:04:41.570> stands<00:04:41.900> alone<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.920> actually<00:04:43.130> got<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
one stands alone and I actually got a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.370 
one stands alone and I actually got a
personal<00:04:44.180> best<00:04:44.330> average<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.840> five<00:04:45.020> with<00:04:45.230> this

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
personal best average of five with this

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.010 
personal best average of five with this
cube<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:46.220> was<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.550> 16<00:04:47.210> point<00:04:47.420> something<00:04:47.900> I'll

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
cube it was a 16 point something I'll

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.420 
cube it was a 16 point something I'll
put<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.290> at<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.500> end<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:48.800> video<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.370> you

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
put it at the end of this video so you

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.280 
put it at the end of this video so you
can<00:04:49.580> check<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.940> out<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.270> this<00:04:50.810> cube<00:04:51.050> going<00:04:51.230> to

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
can check it out is this cube going to

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.190 
can check it out is this cube going to
be<00:04:51.350> my<00:04:51.500> main<00:04:51.730> probably<00:04:52.730> not<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.510> because<00:04:53.870> I

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
be my main probably not just because I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.060 
be my main probably not just because I
don't<00:04:54.440> really<00:04:54.620> enjoy<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.280> feel<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.690> is

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
don't really enjoy the feel but it is

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.040 
don't really enjoy the feel but it is
functionally<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.100> really<00:04:58.580> good<00:04:58.760> cube<00:04:59.090> just<00:04:59.720> not

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
functionally a really good cube just not

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.930 
functionally a really good cube just not
my<00:05:00.230> preference<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.920> know<00:05:00.950> what<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.160> mean<00:05:01.340> but

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
my preference you know what I mean but

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.120 
my preference you know what I mean but
definitely<00:05:02.480> check<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.720> out<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.170> $15<00:05:03.920> right

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
definitely check it out it's $15 right

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.070 
definitely check it out it's $15 right
now<00:05:04.280> at<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.520> cubicle<00:05:04.970> I'll<00:05:05.240> put<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.570> link<00:05:05.810> down

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
now at the cubicle I'll put a link down

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.870 
now at the cubicle I'll put a link down
in<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.260> description<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.400> really<00:05:07.669> want<00:05:07.820> to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
in the description and I really want to

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.100 
in the description and I really want to
thank<00:05:08.060> them<00:05:08.210> again<00:05:08.330> for<00:05:08.480> sending<00:05:08.930> me<00:05:08.990> this

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
thank them again for sending me this

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.380 
thank them again for sending me this
cube<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:09.710> probably<00:05:10.340> my<00:05:10.490> backup<00:05:10.910> main<00:05:11.120> right

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
cube it's probably my backup main right

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.170 
cube it's probably my backup main right
now<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:12.410> surpassed<00:05:12.890> my<00:05:13.190> new<00:05:13.400> island<00:05:13.760> Phoenix

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
now it surpassed my new island Phoenix

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.300 
now it surpassed my new island Phoenix
because<00:05:14.690> even<00:05:15.470> though<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.620> don't<00:05:15.740> enjoy<00:05:16.160> the

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
because even though I don't enjoy the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.610 
because even though I don't enjoy the
feel<00:05:16.550> it's<00:05:17.150> hard<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.510> argue<00:05:17.660> with<00:05:17.810> pure

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
feel it's hard to argue with pure

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.650 
feel it's hard to argue with pure
numbers<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:19.700> cube<00:05:20.000> definitely<00:05:20.510> gets

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
numbers and this cube definitely gets

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.230 
numbers and this cube definitely gets
the<00:05:20.720> numbers<00:05:21.080> for<00:05:21.290> me<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.620> just<00:05:22.040> has<00:05:22.220> some<00:05:22.520> like

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
the numbers for me it just has some like

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.210 
the numbers for me it just has some like
some<00:05:23.600> really<00:05:23.840> strange<00:05:24.230> lock<00:05:24.620> ups<00:05:24.890> when<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.160> do

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
some really strange lock ups when I do

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.430 
some really strange lock ups when I do
this<00:05:25.490> algorithm<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:26.870> can't<00:05:27.230> really

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
this algorithm that I can't really

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.070 
this algorithm that I can't really
understand<00:05:28.120> but<00:05:29.120> it's<00:05:29.330> probably<00:05:29.750> just<00:05:29.930> my

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
understand but it's probably just my

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.860 
understand but it's probably just my
turning<00:05:30.470> style<00:05:30.680> but<00:05:31.220> check<00:05:31.580> out<00:05:31.730> this<00:05:32.090> average

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
turning style but check out this average

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.409 
turning style but check out this average
of<00:05:32.990> five<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.260> got<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:34.400> was<00:05:34.640> kind<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:34.910> lucky<00:05:35.090> cuz

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
of five I got it was kind of lucky cuz

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.690 
of five I got it was kind of lucky cuz
the<00:05:35.540> second<00:05:35.870> 14<00:05:36.230> was<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.440> PLL<00:05:36.950> skip<00:05:37.220> but<00:05:37.610> I'm

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
the second 14 was a PLL skip but I'm

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.950 
the second 14 was a PLL skip but I'm
still<00:05:37.880> really<00:05:37.910> happy<00:05:38.390> with<00:05:38.540> it<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:38.840> I'm<00:05:38.930> still

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
still really happy with it and I'm still

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.380 
still really happy with it and I'm still
happy<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:40.010> got<00:05:40.370> a<00:05:40.430> personal<00:05:40.880> best<00:05:41.090> and
