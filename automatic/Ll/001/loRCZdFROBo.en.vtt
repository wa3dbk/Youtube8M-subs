00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.560
 friends gave me a lot of attention the famous 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.560
 weird sounds let's see exactly 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.350
 sounds of underground features 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.350
 but if I saw that not necessarily 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.480
 comes some waste in the subsoil 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.170
 with the sky that is heard inside the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 head in the end what happens good 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.349
 notice that a year and a half ago or 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.800
 less began to be heard first in 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.780
 peñalolén later when it was learned about this 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.219
 fact began to release people from 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 different regions 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.840
 excuse me on the same date 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.210
 they started to happen this I miss a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.719
 sound that resemble like a mermaid 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.610
 of boats or a thing that stretches in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 time and some call them as the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.500
 plane because it appears as its typical 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 jet aircraft passing earth 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 fastest of the skill towards the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 sound they break with the true males but 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.900
 as if it will never end because 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.870
 the double quad effect 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.490
 you are not 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.100
 it stays stuck contrary it was 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.450
 frozen in the sky that's why they call him 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.060
 the plane 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.310
 Well, pay attention that the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.150
 Last week in Valparaíso 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.370
 I turned on twitter I saw it and suddenly and 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.260
 they started to see valparaíso came the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.660
 plane the plane is here he said he heard us 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.330
 they sent me behind their grandchild someone 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.030
 recorded that video in Valparaíso at full 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.170
 daylight the following was heard 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 come on with the video gentlemen 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.659
 I fixed myself with a ship in fact 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.939
 they sent a lot or not if they would not listen 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.890
 It is now clear very powerful would be 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.899
 fall the height in which there is in the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.600
 shore in the harbor so they do 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.250
 time hey they marked me an amount of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.450
 samples of those sounds in different 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.330
 localities of which this region 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.979
 mainly to paradise and five 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.030
 points of the city both in the plan 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.060
 as in the hill 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.720
 and look external and it listened like that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.459
 car 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.900
 has like like a little yes like 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.670
 increase that seems like a feedback 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.290
 press a network through the station only 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.810
 now the subsoil has an answer for 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 this sound can not happen to us they have done 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.410
 the amount of tremendous prostheses of the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.110
 most serious part of the scientists 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 scholars have tried to find 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.010
 certain explanations because so 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 generally the most professors do not 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.130
 interest these phenomena then that 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.049
 so much I ask you additional the day of 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 today and I think you can select how 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.080
 response to the pri suddenly has 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.040
 answer for this question that we 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.439
 we have close visionaries 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.290
 question there will be salfate because it can 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:46.700
 have vanilla smell in a house without 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.700
 cleaner has no smell 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.580
 I do not know, I think it has to do with 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.790
 soap 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 I do not know, they scream 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.130
 passages 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.130
 unexplainable and smells 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.410
 with the sounds it has been accompanied 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.470
 for the smell of real flowers is that for 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.270
 I did not know many demonstrations 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.270
 supposedly virgins 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.750
 perfect good if you tell me this 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.790
 also comes with colors 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.240
 particular as the flowers that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 generally moves is given in the 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.440
 forest the wind diego something 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.720
 very strange as I say a lot of impotence and 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 from all areas of people 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.840
 more serious that endorse studies of 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.970
 science or from a branch one more branch 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.550
 Esoteric has tried an explanation 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.740
 in fact some even treat us of 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.650
 complement this with the 2012 they say 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.030
 that like that in the vivar setting 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.220
 vibrational between another planet and the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 rest of the universe is created like this 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.510
 kind of like who happens to these 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.250
 fingers and as with the ouija on the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.110
 glass cups that are produced 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.350
 transit through that resonance they say that 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.900
 it seems that it has to do with that 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.459
 it is daring the proposal but without 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.030
 However good does not support us discard 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.610
 which exactly nothing in these tables 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.170
 are I 'm going to ask you here on a trip 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.520
 of the sound any other thing that puts 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.960
 a lot of that because this one is not so clear 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.270
 like the previous one that is pretty obvious 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 but and nicky that too and it was one of 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.540
 the first cities where you also 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.500
 he started listening to these strange sounds 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.500
 underground looking 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.150
 obviously as accompanying the murmur 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.150
 from the city of the wind 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:14.229
 like the two meters of iron 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.520
 pauli quintana say the peñalolén live and 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.889
 I started listening to that but I never 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.530
 I questioned it so far you hear about 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.530
 4 times 4 to 5 times a day 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.240
 in fact it can be some of the theories 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.030
 they say that this is part of a 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.220
 experiment to issue a type of 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.340
 frequency that I can somehow 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.229
 capture as a receptor the human brain and 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.449
 that obviously generates a series of 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.949
 very subtle hallucinations that do not 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.960
 it only has to do with the noise 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.910
 but it would also come smells 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.969
 that can also generate different 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.919
 sensations 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:03.809
 and that activate a series of sense 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.809
 in front of which there is nothing that the demanes
