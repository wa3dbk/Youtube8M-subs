designer<00:04:04.200> intense<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:05.489> suppliant<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.120> really

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
designer intense just suppliant a really

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.380 
designer intense just suppliant a really
thin<00:04:07.019> line<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.590> your<00:04:07.739> upper<00:04:08.040> lashline<00:04:08.390> it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
thin line on your upper lashline it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.330 
thin line on your upper lashline it
doesn't<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.810> be<00:04:09.930> completely<00:04:10.590> perfect<00:04:10.799> um

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
doesn't have to be completely perfect um

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.210 
doesn't have to be completely perfect um
if<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.420> apply<00:04:12.720> some<00:04:13.230> false<00:04:13.440> lashes<00:04:13.590> later

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
if you apply some false lashes later

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.039 
if you apply some false lashes later
because<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.700> false<00:04:14.910> lashes<00:04:15.150> kind<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.780> cover

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
because the false lashes kind of cover

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.220 
because the false lashes kind of cover
the<00:04:16.290> lineup<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.370> what<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.549> did

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
the lineup which is what I did

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.350 
the lineup which is what I did
so<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.310> think<00:04:20.520> you're<00:04:20.640> lying<00:04:20.850> look<00:04:21.150> as

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
so I just think you're lying look as

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.870 
so I just think you're lying look as
pretty<00:04:21.660> as<00:04:21.960> possible<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:23.340> course<00:04:23.610> I

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
pretty as possible and of course I

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.330 
pretty as possible and of course I
messed<00:04:24.240> up<00:04:24.420> a<00:04:24.570> little<00:04:24.660> like<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.350> always<00:04:25.530> do<00:04:25.830> but

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
messed up a little like I always do but

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.100 
messed up a little like I always do but
it's<00:04:26.490> okay<00:04:26.870> nobody's<00:04:27.870> perfect<00:04:27.900> i<00:04:28.350> guess<00:04:28.560> right

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
it's okay nobody's perfect i guess right

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.020 
it's okay nobody's perfect i guess right
but<00:04:31.110> anyway<00:04:31.470> with<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> different<00:04:32.190> liner<00:04:32.400> i<00:04:32.760> use

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
but anyway with a different liner i use

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.720 
but anyway with a different liner i use
the<00:04:33.450> knicks<00:04:33.720> felt<00:04:34.140> tip<00:04:34.410> liner<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:35.550> has<00:04:35.700> a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
the knicks felt tip liner it just has a

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.760 
the knicks felt tip liner it just has a
sharper<00:04:36.180> point<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:36.960> easier<00:04:37.350> for<00:04:37.410> making

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
sharper point and it's easier for making

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.160 
sharper point and it's easier for making
wings<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.390> don't<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.870> win<00:04:40.020> your

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
wings but if you don't like to win your

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.690 
wings but if you don't like to win your
eyes<00:04:40.350> out<00:04:40.590> then<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.070> really<00:04:41.310> don't<00:04:41.430> have<00:04:41.640> to

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
eyes out then you really don't have to

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.570 
eyes out then you really don't have to
this<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.540> personal<00:04:42.990> preference<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.650> I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
this is just personal preference and I
