turned<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.170> xbox<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> few<00:01:38.340> days<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
turned my xbox on in a few days now so I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
turned my xbox on in a few days now so I
didn't<00:01:39.479> even<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> patch

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
didn't even know that there was a patch

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
didn't even know that there was a patch
but<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.310> asked<00:01:41.579> around<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but I asked around a little bit and it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.020 
but I asked around a little bit and it
seems<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.619> laggy<00:01:44.189> menus<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
seems that it's for laggy menus and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
seems that it's for laggy menus and
maybe<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> career<00:01:46.110> mode<00:01:46.290> stuff

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
maybe a little bit of career mode stuff

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.569 
maybe a little bit of career mode stuff
I<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> patch

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I don't think it's really a patch

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
I don't think it's really a patch
affecting<00:01:48.240> ultimate<00:01:48.780> team<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
affecting ultimate team that much so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.280 
affecting ultimate team that much so
it's<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:52.079> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it's not something that I'm gonna be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.590 
it's not something that I'm gonna be
worrying<00:01:52.649> about<00:01:52.970> directly<00:01:53.970> at<00:01:54.060> least<00:01:54.450> not

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
worrying about directly at least not

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
worrying about directly at least not
right<00:01:54.780> away<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:55.259> gets<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.560> goal<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:55.950> here

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
right away he gets a goal back here

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.469 
right away he gets a goal back here
they're<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.610> really<00:01:56.790> frustrating<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
they're really really frustrating I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
they're really really frustrating I
thought<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.810> well<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.310> acrobatic

clearance and to do the acrobatic
clearance<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:03.000> far<00:02:03.360> too<00:02:03.420> reliable

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
clearance and it generally does a pretty

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to try to shoot with Bab on because he's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.979

the box and I'm like I'm gonna have one
chance<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.090> save<00:02:42.329> this<00:02:42.599> for<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> game<00:02:43.170> and

chance to save this for the game and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.020 
chance to save this for the game and
then<00:02:43.560> I'm<00:02:43.680> gonna<00:02:43.769> have<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.219> go<00:02:44.340> back<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.609> score

but<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.549> okay<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.120> game<00:02:48.299> freezes<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
but it's okay the game freezes so I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.589 
but it's okay the game freezes so I
guess<00:02:50.099> that's<00:02:50.250> FIFA's<00:02:50.730> way<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.150> telling<00:02:51.510> me

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
guess that's FIFA's way of telling me

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.729 
guess that's FIFA's way of telling me
that<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.810> was<00:02:52.019> going<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.409> loss

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739

this<00:05:30.060> happens<00:05:30.479> right<00:05:30.750> away<00:05:30.930> 39th<00:05:31.500> minute<00:05:31.710> I<00:05:32.009> go

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
this happens right away 39th minute I go

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.830 
this happens right away 39th minute I go
I<00:05:32.460> switched<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:32.940> free<00:05:33.060> kick<00:05:33.240> taker<00:05:33.419> Giuseppe

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
I switched the free kick taker Giuseppe

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.860 
I switched the free kick taker Giuseppe
Rossi<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.440> game<00:05:34.680> freezes<00:05:35.630> right<00:05:36.630> here

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
Rossi and the game freezes right here

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.320 
Rossi and the game freezes right here
now<00:05:37.190> this<00:05:38.190> was<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.370> different<00:05:38.759> kind<00:05:38.789> of<00:05:39.060> freeze

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
now this was a different kind of freeze

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.350 
now this was a different kind of freeze
because<00:05:39.949> you<00:05:40.949> I<00:05:41.190> could<00:05:41.460> move<00:05:41.610> my<00:05:41.669> play<00:05:42.120> around

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
because you I could move my play around

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.180 
because you I could move my play around
look<00:05:42.659> around<00:05:42.780> I<00:05:43.229> try<00:05:43.469> to<00:05:43.500> pause<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.009> game<00:05:44.039> and

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
look around I try to pause the game and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.860 
look around I try to pause the game and
say<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.520> wouldn't<00:05:44.789> have<00:05:44.909> possession<00:05:45.419> he<00:05:45.690> was

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
say I wouldn't have possession he was

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.689 
say I wouldn't have possession he was
still<00:05:46.080> moving<00:05:46.259> around<00:05:46.469> it<00:05:46.889> was<00:05:47.009> really<00:05:47.520> really

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
still moving around it was really really

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.969 
still moving around it was really really
weird<00:05:48.120> but<00:05:48.990> nothing<00:05:49.469> would<00:05:49.590> happen<00:05:49.770> I

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
weird but nothing would happen I

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.100 
weird but nothing would happen I
couldn't<00:05:50.280> take<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.550> free-kick<00:05:50.759> he<00:05:51.330> just<00:05:51.719> ran

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
couldn't take the free-kick he just ran

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.749 
couldn't take the free-kick he just ran
around<00:05:52.259> in<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.590> circle<00:05:52.889> a<00:05:53.070> bunch<00:05:53.219> of<00:05:53.370> times<00:05:53.550> and

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
around in a circle a bunch of times and

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.520 
around in a circle a bunch of times and
I<00:05:54.120> thought<00:05:54.330> there's<00:05:54.599> no<00:05:54.659> way<00:05:54.780> I'm<00:05:55.110> giving<00:05:55.320> up

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
I thought there's no way I'm giving up

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.320 
I thought there's no way I'm giving up
this<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:56.190> win<00:05:56.460> especially<00:05:56.699> after<00:05:57.150> having

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
this this win especially after having

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.790 
this this win especially after having
disconnected<00:05:58.050> from<00:05:58.139> the<00:05:58.259> first<00:05:58.440> one<00:05:58.620> I'm

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
disconnected from the first one I'm

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.379 
disconnected from the first one I'm
gonna<00:05:59.070> wait<00:05:59.370> this<00:05:59.580> one<00:05:59.759> out<00:05:59.789> and<00:05:59.940> I<00:06:00.090> waited

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
gonna wait this one out and I waited

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.689 
gonna wait this one out and I waited
long<00:06:00.630> enough<00:06:00.659> and<00:06:01.020> he<00:06:01.770> ended<00:06:02.099> up<00:06:02.219> quitting<00:06:02.460> out

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
long enough and he ended up quitting out

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.029 
long enough and he ended up quitting out
so<00:06:03.030> not<00:06:03.509> another<00:06:03.810> free<00:06:04.139> loss<00:06:04.320> i<00:06:04.560> guess<00:06:04.590> kind<00:06:04.949> of
