00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:02.230

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:05.019

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.959

 in bed at home that sucks 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.030
 the market because they are called to today 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 we hope the game decides to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.389
 work out but no good you have 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.520
 visa accosted on the spot came to the 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.240
 place not to take the ball and not 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.550
 I believe he had good good non kaka 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.430
 the big transfer market that every day 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.650
 from there the evidence of the blow to the child 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.570
 It really is a great pleasure to throw the ball 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.790
 and we can start with lazarevic nazaire 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.650
 starting from there you can start if long 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.170
 it's not a bit too much but it resists 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.210
 lazarevic lazarevic is still what there 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.550
 holds the ball for the five loop 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.510
 number books does not know what to do 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.450
 gaza gaza gaza still the cia launches 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.910
 curse lance penalty believed it 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:09.260
 camon times do it from there I present you 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:13.400
 beautiful when I say that the game does not 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.330
 He wants you to win PC love but what if 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.030
 smakay all ivanov and is not normal 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:25.790
 ends now more in the 0 0 gentlemen one is 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.950
 moved forward ie if no marked 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.700
 so look at the poule by hand the calendars 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.860
 s upstream fishing upstream the six cycle 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.850
 meters that were fine I live there from there 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.250
 and he looks at us there violated what has happened 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:45.290
 elected pulls but words of love bowed 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.860
 the only forward was Chiellini on a 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.860
 corner 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.550
 that is, it seems to you that the only one forward on a 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.420
 the corner was the defender 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.420
 central tevez 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:08.249
 I enjoy pieces of shit langa like a pig 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.639
 and langa while there is the ball while he 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.919
 I have to counter it he did then started 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.860
 out of area that gave rigorini 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.490
 collection has started outside the area has begun 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.409
 outside the area the foul scored a 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.029
 own goal that I didn't click and on 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.680
 penalty that was foul out of area 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.189
 when I saw fifa it really works 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.119
 good this year and I recommend the only one 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:34.469
 the market was the problem of being scared 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.969
 market own year fixed the only thing 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.379
 wrong of fear 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.020
 yes because of the goalkeeper texts 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.729
 work well there is no script not 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.919
 decides the game when you have to win o 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.719
 losing fouls work well 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.270
 the referee works well the goalkeepers 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.069
 they work well footballers work 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.870

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:56.899
