00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
so other than that it still is a great

Batmobile tumbler and I really bought
this<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.989> looks<00:03:32.200> of<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.560> didn't<00:03:32.830> buy

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
this for the looks of it I didn't buy

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.220 
this for the looks of it I didn't buy
for<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.250> whole<00:03:33.340> gimmick<00:03:33.580> at<00:03:34.060> first<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.930> then

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
for the whole gimmick at first and then

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.780 
for the whole gimmick at first and then
I<00:03:35.350> started<00:03:35.650> looking<00:03:35.920> at<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> gimmick<00:03:36.430> itself

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
I started looking at the gimmick itself

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.340 
I started looking at the gimmick itself
and<00:03:37.090> started<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> realize<00:03:38.050> you<00:03:38.170> know<00:03:38.260> it

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
and started to realize you know it

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.930 
and started to realize you know it
really<00:03:38.470> isn't<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.890> bad<00:03:39.130> if<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.580> take<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> look

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
really isn't that bad if you take a look

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.620 
really isn't that bad if you take a look
at<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.010> said<00:03:42.100> before<00:03:42.300> you<00:03:43.300> open<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
at it and like I said before you open it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.979 
at it and like I said before you open it
up<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.220> don't<00:03:45.220> mind<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.610> part<00:03:45.910> coming<00:03:46.120> up<00:03:46.330> now

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
up I don't mind this part coming up now

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.920 
up I don't mind this part coming up now
these<00:03:47.260> parts<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.769> do<00:03:47.860> mine<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:49.510> was<00:03:49.690> kind<00:03:49.870> of

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
these parts I do mine and it was kind of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.720 
these parts I do mine and it was kind of
weird<00:03:50.110> but<00:03:50.440> if<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.709> were<00:03:50.830> actually<00:03:51.250> able<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
weird but if you were actually able to

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.690 
weird but if you were actually able to
just<00:03:52.030> modify<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.780> little<00:03:52.989> bit<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:54.550> only

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
just modify it a little bit you only

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.559 
just modify it a little bit you only
have<00:03:54.940> this<00:03:55.150> going<00:03:55.480> up<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.750> down<00:03:55.900> then

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
have this going up and down then

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.819 
have this going up and down then
really<00:03:56.749> isn't<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:56.989> bad<00:03:57.260> it's<00:03:57.439> kind<00:03:57.469> of<00:03:57.650> like

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
really isn't that bad it's kind of like

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.619 
really isn't that bad it's kind of like
in<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:57.980> movie<00:03:58.370> when<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:59.209> opens<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.540> the

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
in the movie when the the opens up the

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.470 
in the movie when the the opens up the
cockpit<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.230> part<00:04:00.439> opens<00:04:00.680> up<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.069> comes<00:04:01.249> out

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
cockpit this part opens up and comes out

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.589 
cockpit this part opens up and comes out
so<00:04:02.480> from<00:04:02.749> that<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.790> now<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.269> my

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
so from that we have this now this is my

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.729 
so from that we have this now this is my
work-in-progress

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
work-in-progress

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.110 
work-in-progress

Applied<00:04:13.730> Sciences<00:04:14.389> getting<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.469> this<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.799> a

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
Applied Sciences getting to this is a

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.469 
Applied Sciences getting to this is a
work<00:04:16.070> in<00:04:16.250> progress<00:04:16.489> but<00:04:16.699> you<00:04:16.849> get<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.150> idea

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
work in progress but you get the idea

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.310 
work in progress but you get the idea
now<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:18.320> when<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.560> press<00:04:18.769> number<00:04:18.979> one<00:04:20.320> only

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
now that when you press number one only

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.230 
now that when you press number one only
the<00:04:21.410> top<00:04:21.620> comes<00:04:21.889> up<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.610> sides<00:04:22.820> are<00:04:23.000> stuck

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
the top comes up and the sides are stuck

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.689 
the top comes up and the sides are stuck
down<00:04:23.270> yes<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.320> kept<00:04:24.889> it<00:04:25.009> so<00:04:25.220> they<00:04:25.340> don't<00:04:25.550> come

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
down yes I kept it so they don't come

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.089 
down yes I kept it so they don't come
out<00:04:25.849> anymore<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.810> look<00:04:26.990> inside<00:04:27.320> he<00:04:27.620> has<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.770> lot

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099

Batpod used to be so like I said before

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.499 
Batpod used to be so like I said before

there's<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.199> lot<00:05:03.409> of<00:05:03.590> springs<00:05:03.949> in<00:05:04.099> this<00:05:04.220> one

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
there's a lot of springs in this one

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.120 
there's a lot of springs in this one
right<00:05:04.729> here<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:06.500> know<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.710> spring<00:05:07.039> right

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
right here you know the spring right

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.890 
right here you know the spring right
here<00:05:07.190> spring<00:05:07.669> right<00:05:07.849> here<00:05:07.909> spring<00:05:08.389> over<00:05:08.630> here

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
here spring right here spring over here

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.529 
here spring right here spring over here
on<00:05:09.110> both<00:05:09.289> sides<00:05:09.560> spring<00:05:09.949> in<00:05:10.039> the<00:05:10.130> bottom<00:05:10.550> three

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
on both sides spring in the bottom three

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.469 
on both sides spring in the bottom three
Springs<00:05:11.840> on<00:05:11.990> top<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:12.380> have<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.620> take<00:05:12.800> two<00:05:12.979> outs

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
Springs on top you have to take two outs

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.820 
Springs on top you have to take two outs
definitely<00:05:14.479> had<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.750> had<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.110> dissect<00:05:15.530> this<00:05:15.650> one

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
definitely had I had to dissect this one

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.180 
definitely had I had to dissect this one
like<00:05:15.979> crazy<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.490> get<00:05:16.580> everything<00:05:16.880> out<00:05:17.860> but<00:05:18.860> it

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
like crazy to get everything out but it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.879 
like crazy to get everything out but it
worked<00:05:19.520> out<00:05:19.699> in<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> end<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.889> permanently

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
worked out in the end and I permanently

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.320 
worked out in the end and I permanently
stuck<00:05:22.099> down<00:05:22.310> everything<00:05:22.759> as<00:05:22.849> well<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:23.240> they

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
stuck down everything as well so they

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.640 
stuck down everything as well so they
don't<00:05:23.509> pop<00:05:23.720> out<00:05:23.870> anymore

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
don't pop out anymore

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.439 
don't pop out anymore
and<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.460> was<00:05:25.550> really<00:05:25.759> great<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.120> get<00:05:26.210> all<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
and it was really great to get all the

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.089 
and it was really great to get all the
springs<00:05:26.780> out<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.500> don't<00:05:27.680> hear<00:05:27.830> that

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
springs out so you don't hear that

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.550 
springs out so you don't hear that
echoey<00:05:28.750> spring<00:05:29.750> sound<00:05:30.020> which<00:05:30.229> is<00:05:30.259> really

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
echoey spring sound which is really

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.969 
echoey spring sound which is really
annoying<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:32.360> hear<00:05:32.509> that<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:33.530> bothers<00:05:33.860> a

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
annoying you hear that that bothers a

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.200 
annoying you hear that that bothers a
cat<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.340> didn't<00:05:34.490> mean<00:05:34.580> when<00:05:34.759> you<00:05:34.820> do<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.060> now
