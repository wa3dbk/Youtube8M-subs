00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.330 
has to say with you know looking older
makes<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:04.920> time<00:05:05.250> more<00:05:05.520> quickly<00:05:07.130> quickly<00:05:08.130> but

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
makes you time more quickly quickly but

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.340 
makes you time more quickly quickly but
I<00:05:08.400> think<00:05:08.730> did<00:05:09.480> he<00:05:09.540> say<00:05:09.690> literally<00:05:10.110> looking

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
I think did he say literally looking

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.660 
I think did he say literally looking
older<00:05:10.560> makes<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> die<00:05:10.950> more<00:05:11.010> quickly<00:05:11.310> boys

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
older makes you die more quickly boys

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.720 
older makes you die more quickly boys
tend<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.570> people<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.680> look<00:05:13.860> older<00:05:14.130> tend<00:05:14.520> to

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
tend to people that look older tend to

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.510 
tend to people that look older tend to
die<00:05:14.880> sooner<00:05:15.420> Chris<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:16.500> yeah<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.040> think<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.460> has

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
die sooner Chris so yeah I think it has

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.120 
die sooner Chris so yeah I think it has
to<00:05:17.670> do<00:05:17.970> with<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.450> causality<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:19.050> them<00:05:19.620> looking

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
to do with the causality of them looking

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.460 
to do with the causality of them looking
older<00:05:20.580> like<00:05:20.880> if<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.630> have<00:05:21.810> someone<00:05:22.200> if<00:05:22.380> you

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
older like if you have someone if you

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.860 
older like if you have someone if you
have<00:05:22.560> two<00:05:22.710> people<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.610> are<00:05:23.670> 40<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.510> one

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
have two people that that are 40 and one

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.180 
have two people that that are 40 and one
of<00:05:24.990> them<00:05:25.080> looks<00:05:25.290> like<00:05:25.350> they're<00:05:25.620> in<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.920> early

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
of them looks like they're in the early

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.040 
of them looks like they're in the early
30s<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.640> one<00:05:26.850> of<00:05:26.940> them<00:05:27.030> looks<00:05:27.210> closer<00:05:27.510> to<00:05:27.690> 50

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
30s and one of them looks closer to 50

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.630 
30s and one of them looks closer to 50
you<00:05:28.770> know<00:05:28.800> what<00:05:29.010> do<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.100> mean<00:05:29.250> that's<00:05:29.400> usually

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
you know what do you mean that's usually

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.500 
you know what do you mean that's usually
maybe<00:05:30.060> Ali's<00:05:30.420> murder<00:05:30.720> our<00:05:31.320> smoking<00:05:31.710> drinking

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
maybe Ali's murder our smoking drinking

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.140 
maybe Ali's murder our smoking drinking
exercise<00:05:33.510> yeah<00:05:34.170> like<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.340> differences<00:05:35.820> in

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
exercise yeah like the differences in

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.400 
exercise yeah like the differences in
the<00:05:36.330> lifestyles<00:05:36.810> they're<00:05:36.930> living<00:05:37.230> are

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
the lifestyles they're living are

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.980 
the lifestyles they're living are
usually<00:05:37.920> factors<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.760> are<00:05:39.060> contributing<00:05:39.960> to

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
usually factors that are contributing to

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.840 
usually factors that are contributing to
that<00:05:40.110> yeah<00:05:40.650> well<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:41.250> think<00:05:41.460> what<00:05:41.730> he<00:05:41.820> was

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
that yeah well I think what he was

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.310 
that yeah well I think what he was
trying<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.210> get<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.450> was<00:05:42.810> like<00:05:42.990> does<00:05:43.170> this

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
trying to get to was like does this

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.470 
trying to get to was like does this
matter<00:05:43.590> how<00:05:43.920> old<00:05:44.130> we<00:05:44.190> look<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.640> mean<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:45.030> lot

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
matter how old we look I mean a lot

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.590 
matter how old we look I mean a lot
