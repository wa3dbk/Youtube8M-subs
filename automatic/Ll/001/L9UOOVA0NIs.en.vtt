00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
seasons um because that my last reviews

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
seasons um because that my last reviews
I<00:00:34.340> focused<00:00:35.340> more<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.030> box<00:00:36.390> art<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.070> box

rather<00:00:38.790> than<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> season<00:00:40.739> itself<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.110> that's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
rather than the season itself so that's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.860 
rather than the season itself so that's
something<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.210> improve<00:00:45.600> on
