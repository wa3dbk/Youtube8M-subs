where<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.920> big<00:00:38.100> blue<00:00:38.309> tree<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:38.820> long

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
where are we going big blue tree as long

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
where are we going big blue tree as long
as<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.420> believe<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.290> dramatic

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
as you believe this is a very dramatic

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
as you believe this is a very dramatic
intro<00:00:41.489> am<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.329> squared<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.809> long

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
intro am i this little squared as long

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
intro am i this little squared as long
as<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> believe<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> square<00:00:44.670> all

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
as you believe that you are a square all

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
as you believe that you are a square all
of<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.239> sides<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.440> equal<00:00:46.800> all

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
of your sides will probably be equal all

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380 
of your sides will probably be equal all
right<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.309> magnetized<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> don't

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
right so this is magnetized and I don't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
right so this is magnetized and I don't
really<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.780> much<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.920> came

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
hopefully I mean I was under the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.120 
hopefully I mean I was under the
impression<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> wasn't<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
impression that it wasn't that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.560 
impression that it wasn't that
impression<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:17.909> heavy<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.270> hopefully

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
impression was pretty heavy so hopefully

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.030 
impression was pretty heavy so hopefully
I<00:01:18.630> wasn't<00:01:18.930> underneath<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.680> long<00:01:19.710> for

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I wasn't underneath it for so long for

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.560 
I wasn't underneath it for so long for
