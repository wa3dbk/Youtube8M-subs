that's<00:03:29.260> pretty<00:03:29.500> cool<00:03:29.620> but<00:03:29.890> currently<00:03:30.609> he<00:03:30.880> has

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
that's pretty cool but currently he has

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.030 
that's pretty cool but currently he has
no<00:03:31.390> form<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.900> evolution<00:03:32.410> meaning<00:03:32.680> he<00:03:32.769> stays<00:03:33.010> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
no form of evolution meaning he stays a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.210 
no form of evolution meaning he stays a
baby<00:03:33.579> earth<00:03:34.299> pet<00:03:34.780> forever<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:35.470> elemental<00:03:36.010> pet

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
baby earth pet forever or elemental pet

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.430 
baby earth pet forever or elemental pet
forever<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.880> he<00:03:37.329> doesn't<00:03:37.600> really<00:03:37.690> spawn<00:03:38.200> into

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
forever and he doesn't really spawn into

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.340 
forever and he doesn't really spawn into

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
spawn that our golem now I do have a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.830 
spawn that our golem now I do have a
full<00:03:59.829> diamond<00:04:00.220> set<00:04:00.609> up<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.120> predict<00:04:01.690> I

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
full diamond set up so I do predict I

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.780 
full diamond set up so I do predict I
might<00:04:02.109> win<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.470> one<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.280> let's<00:04:03.489> spot<00:04:03.670> him

might win this one so let's spot him
down<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.120> see<00:04:04.299> where<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.630> go<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.260> good

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
down and see where this go so it's good

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.809 
down and see where this go so it's good
see<00:04:05.530> go<00:04:05.680> straight<00:04:06.010> for<00:04:06.220> me<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.489> attack

see go straight for me with the attack

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.940 
see go straight for me with the attack
doing<00:04:07.540> only<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> half<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.350> heart<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.620> damage<00:04:08.920> he

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
doing only a half a heart of damage he

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.770 
doing only a half a heart of damage he
does<00:04:09.250> affect<00:04:09.579> me<00:04:09.730> with<00:04:09.850> weakness<00:04:10.299> too<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:10.660> you
