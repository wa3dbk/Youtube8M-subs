timing<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:21.170> basically<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.410> came<00:00:22.769> out

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
timing to it it basically just came out

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
timing to it it basically just came out
of<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.189> pull<00:00:23.430> offs<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> was<00:00:24.029> doing<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
of some pull offs that I was doing and I

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
of some pull offs that I was doing and I
tried<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.080> pick<00:00:25.260> him<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.769> they<00:00:25.920> seem<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> work

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
tried to pick him and they seem to work

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.300 
tried to pick him and they seem to work
great<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.269> i<00:00:27.630> found<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> works<00:00:28.109> best<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
great but i found this works best on a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.009 
great but i found this works best on a
company<00:00:29.760> unless<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.480> songs<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
company unless you do a lot of songs in

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.190 
company unless you do a lot of songs in
98<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.830> some<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.279> signature<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:34.110> know

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
98 or some time signature that you know

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.430 
98 or some time signature that you know
few<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.280> dare<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> play<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
few would dare to play but this is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
few would dare to play but this is
basically<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> goes<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.270> two

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
basically how it goes it's all in two

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.869 
basically how it goes it's all in two
strings<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> b<00:00:40.410> string<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.460> E<00:00:41.489> string

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
strings the b string and the E string

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.440 
strings the b string and the E string
and<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.930> g<00:00:43.230> minor<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.149> i'm<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and so on g minor and i'm just going to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.869 
and so on g minor and i'm just going to
play<00:00:45.629> through<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> real<00:00:46.200> real<00:00:46.379> slow<00:00:52.879> that's

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
play through it real real slow that's

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.950 
play through it real real slow that's
basically<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.719> first<00:00:55.050> pattern<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> it

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.049 

from<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.280> does<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> same<00:01:02.789> kind<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
from there it just does the same kind of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
from there it just does the same kind of
pattern<00:01:03.269> but<00:01:03.750> starting<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.530> new<00:01:05.129> note<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pattern but starting on that new note so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:21.210 
pattern but starting on that new note so
that<00:01:06.149> there<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:10.850> from<00:01:11.850> there

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:31.940 

and<00:01:22.000> then<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.960> ascend<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.590> same<00:01:23.770> thing

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.420 

yes

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.130 

and<00:01:40.430> you're<00:01:40.580> back<00:01:40.730> at<00:01:40.850> your<00:01:40.880> original<00:01:41.330> note<00:01:41.510> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
and you're back at your original note so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.940 
and you're back at your original note so
let<00:01:42.260> me<00:01:42.320> play<00:01:42.470> through<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.680> whole<00:01:42.740> thing

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
let me play through the whole thing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.230 
let me play through the whole thing
without<00:01:43.040> stopping<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.000> hear<00:01:44.090> how<00:01:44.180> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
without stopping so you can hear how it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:02:11.320 
without stopping so you can hear how it
sounds<00:01:44.300> together

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.610 

something<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.600> now<00:02:13.200> before<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.530> even

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
something like that now before you even

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.650 
something like that now before you even
attempt<00:02:14.190> doing<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.000> quick<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.510> really

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
attempt doing this quick it's really

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
attempt doing this quick it's really
important<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.080> sort<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.380> take<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.740> section

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
important to sort of take one section

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.500 
important to sort of take one section
and<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.610> down<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.090> probably<00:02:18.270> want<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and get it down so you probably want to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.980 
and get it down so you probably want to
start<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> top<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.069> uh<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:24.840> did

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
start at the top and just go uh we did

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.580 
start at the top and just go uh we did
that<00:02:25.110> much<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.500> it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.479 

alternate<00:02:32.590> picking<00:02:32.739> starting<00:02:33.159> with<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> down

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
alternate picking starting with the down

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.449 
alternate picking starting with the down
stroke<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:35.830> keeps<00:02:36.099> me<00:02:36.280> on

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
stroke and thing that really keeps me on

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.059 
stroke and thing that really keeps me on
the<00:02:36.489> ball<00:02:36.790> doing<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:38.010> concentrating<00:02:39.010> on

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
the ball doing this is concentrating on

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.240 
the ball doing this is concentrating on
where<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.430> left<00:02:39.640> hand<00:02:40.500> shifts<00:02:41.500> positions<00:02:42.010> and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
where the left hand shifts positions and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.039 
where the left hand shifts positions and
for<00:02:42.670> some<00:02:42.849> reason<00:02:42.879> it<00:02:43.269> always<00:02:43.299> ends<00:02:43.750> up<00:02:43.810> being

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
for some reason it always ends up being

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.530 
for some reason it always ends up being
a<00:02:44.140> Down<00:02:44.319> stroke<00:02:44.500> there<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.099> if<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.370> sink<00:02:45.730> up<00:02:45.909> my

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
a Down stroke there so if I sink up my

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.710 
a Down stroke there so if I sink up my
left<00:02:46.750> hand<00:02:46.930> shifts<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.849> my<00:02:48.849> downstroke<00:02:49.420> seems

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
left hand shifts and my downstroke seems

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.270 
left hand shifts and my downstroke seems
to<00:02:49.810> help<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.019> lot<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.769> concentrated<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.340> going

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to help a lot so I concentrated on going

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.390 
to help a lot so I concentrated on going
down<00:02:55.319> down<00:02:56.319> because<00:02:56.890> those<00:02:57.040> are<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.220> two

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
down down because those are the two

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.400 
down down because those are the two
shifts<00:02:58.349> down<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.849> I<00:03:01.390> found<00:03:01.629> that<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:02.049> really

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
shifts down and I found that that really

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.559 
shifts down and I found that that really
keeps<00:03:02.560> me<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.859> sync<00:03:03.190> with<00:03:03.310> my<00:03:03.459> two<00:03:03.519> hands<00:03:03.879> so

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
keeps me in sync with my two hands so

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.449 
keeps me in sync with my two hands so
let<00:03:05.290> me<00:03:05.319> play<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> whole<00:03:05.769> thing<00:03:05.980> pretty<00:03:06.160> quick

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
let me play the whole thing pretty quick

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:17.880 
let me play the whole thing pretty quick
and<00:03:06.780> see<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.930> works

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.440 

Oh

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450
