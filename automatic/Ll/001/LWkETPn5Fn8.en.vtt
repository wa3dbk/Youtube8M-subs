so<00:00:02.310> that<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.490> have<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.290> program<00:00:04.290> another<00:00:04.859> if

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
so that I have the program another if

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:19.700 
so that I have the program another if
both<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.250> us<00:00:05.490> again<00:00:05.819> defended<00:00:18.350> you<00:00:19.350> said<00:00:19.529> what

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
both of us again defended you said what

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.410 
both of us again defended you said what
I<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.430> sure<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> legs<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
I do is to make sure that the legs are

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.859 
I do is to make sure that the legs are
holding<00:00:21.840> utilized<00:00:22.460> directing<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:24.269> program

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
holding utilized directing this program

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.140 
holding utilized directing this program
also<00:00:25.050> makes<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.560> certain<00:00:25.740> check<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
also makes a certain check that all the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.390 
also makes a certain check that all the
laces<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.840> all<00:00:28.080> responding<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> sensors

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
laces are all responding the sensors

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
laces are all responding the sensors
about<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.880> okay<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
about this okay it's like a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:48.650 
about this okay it's like a
self-diagnostic<00:00:31.710> tisha

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.320 

okay<00:00:49.660> so<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.520> because<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.940> have<00:00:52.060> to<00:00:52.120> watch

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
okay so it because you have to watch

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.230 
okay so it because you have to watch
quite<00:00:53.200> closely<00:00:53.500> availability<00:00:54.400> slow<00:00:54.970> down

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
quite closely availability slow down

which<00:00:59.739> again<00:00:59.950> holy<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.260> what<00:01:02.620> carefully

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
which again holy so what carefully

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
which again holy so what carefully

selectively life of each leg but what it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.960 
selectively life of each leg but what it
has<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.830> before<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.220> can<00:01:15.430> place<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.880> has

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
has to do is before it can place it has

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.210 
has to do is before it can place it has
to<00:01:16.150> ensure<00:01:16.300> that<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.690> slaves<00:01:16.869> gone<00:01:17.229> okay<00:01:18.040> and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
to ensure that the slaves gone okay and

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.130 
to ensure that the slaves gone okay and
similarly<00:01:18.910> before<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.330> attracts<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.840> has<00:01:19.960> been

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
similarly before it attracts it has been

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.840 
similarly before it attracts it has been
noted<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.740> place<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.400> that<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.640> drag

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
noted this place so that the drag

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
noted this place so that the drag
doesn't<00:01:22.030> happen<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.670> can<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
doesn't happen and you can see that the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.800 
doesn't happen and you can see that the
perfection<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.850> interaction<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.570> this

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
perfection of this interaction of this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.889 
perfection of this interaction of this
is<00:01:28.990> trig<00:01:29.229> identities<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.270> want<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.570> shave

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
is trig identities we just want to shave

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:40.530 
is trig identities we just want to shave
in<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.290> signature<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.369> we<00:01:39.240> sippin<00:01:40.240> will<00:01:40.390> program

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
in a signature so we sippin will program

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.180 
in a signature so we sippin will program
what<00:01:40.810> would<00:01:40.930> happen<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.290> this<00:01:41.740> would<00:01:41.950> raise

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
what would happen is this would raise

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.480 
what would happen is this would raise
goes<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.320> before<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.500> drops<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.130> refraction

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
goes on before it drops this refraction

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.160 
goes on before it drops this refraction
I<00:01:45.759> see<00:01:45.970> yeah<00:01:46.270> because<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.600> cause<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.930> do<00:01:47.080> the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
I see yeah because you cause you do the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:56.010 
I see yeah because you cause you do the
next<00:01:47.320> lifetime<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:52.080> mean<00:01:53.080> video<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.869> she

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
next lifetime I mean video that if she

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.199 
next lifetime I mean video that if she
has<00:01:56.200> an<00:01:56.350> onboard<00:01:56.590> controller<00:01:57.399> will<00:01:58.090> if

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
has an onboard controller will if

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.940 
has an onboard controller will if
network<00:01:58.630> fast<00:01:58.990> enough<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.649> have<00:01:59.860> a

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
network fast enough that you have a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.130 
network fast enough that you have a
clear<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.340> performance<00:02:00.850> look<00:02:01.330> here<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.810> see

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
clear that performance look here you see

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.109 
clear that performance look here you see
a<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.350> bit<00:02:02.530> latency<00:02:03.069> as<00:02:03.250> soon<00:02:03.700> as<00:02:03.819> this<00:02:03.940> guy

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
a little bit latency as soon as this guy

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.059 
a little bit latency as soon as this guy
drops<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.509> want<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.869> side<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.289> so<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:05.830> like

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
drops I want to the side of it so I like

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.919 
drops I want to the side of it so I like
really<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.550> millisecond<00:02:06.789> difference<00:02:07.270> but

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
really in a millisecond difference but

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.900 
really in a millisecond difference but
you<00:02:08.050> see<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:09.340> three<00:02:09.490> conditioning

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
you see it the three conditioning

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.340 
you see it the three conditioning
evaluation<00:02:10.390> takes<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.690> little<00:02:10.840> little<00:02:11.110> bit<00:02:11.230> of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
evaluation takes a little little bit of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
evaluation takes a little little bit of
time<00:02:11.530> before<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.010> says<00:02:12.160> its<00:02:12.370> own<00:02:12.490> steam<00:02:14.370> they

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
time before it says its own steam they

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.620 
time before it says its own steam they
see<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.670> statehood<00:02:16.120> relation<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.569> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
see this statehood relation of the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.900 
see this statehood relation of the
signalers<00:02:17.080> they<00:02:17.680> put<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> coon<00:02:18.190> pull<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> robot

and it stopped working because spring

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.280 
and it stopped working because spring
conditions<00:02:21.610> are<00:02:21.970> not<00:02:22.090> satisfied<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.080> if<00:02:23.170> I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
conditions are not satisfied so if I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.190 
conditions are not satisfied so if I
drop<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.770> on<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:23.980> lexus<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.700> down<00:02:25.300> then<00:02:26.020> it's

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
drop this on the lexus is down then it's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.070 
drop this on the lexus is down then it's
back

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.800 

let's<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.380> the
