but it stops roblox gravity from

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
but it stops roblox gravity from
applying<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.860> roblox<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.579> a

so<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.739> inserted<00:00:56.309> another<00:00:56.730> part<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.420> gonna

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
so I inserted another part I'm gonna

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.970 
so I inserted another part I'm gonna
resize<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.620> one<00:01:00.289> maybe<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> I'm

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
resize this one maybe like that I'm

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850 
resize this one maybe like that I'm
gonna<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.609> control<00:01:03.090> C<00:01:03.120> control<00:01:03.359> V<00:01:03.860> make

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
gonna do control C control V make

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.340 
gonna do control C control V make
another<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:07.159> copy<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.729> ways

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
another one copy it up a little ways

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
another one copy it up a little ways

big<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.140> third<00:01:32.470> one<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:32.979> I'm<00:01:33.970> going

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
big about on the third one up I'm going

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.120 
big about on the third one up I'm going
to<00:01:35.100> name<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.240> window<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:38.590> going<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.829> change

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
to name it window I'm going to change

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.700 
to name it window I'm going to change
the<00:01:39.280> color<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.840> blue<00:01:40.840> change<00:01:41.590> the

the color to blue change the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.410 
the color to blue change the
transparency<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.610> about<00:01:42.880> point<00:01:43.299> four<00:01:45.210> make<00:01:46.210> it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
transparency to about point four make it

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.510 
transparency to about point four make it
go<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:47.159> make<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.189> be<00:01:48.460> maybe<00:01:48.700> three<00:01:50.250> blocks<00:01:51.250> up

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
go up make it be maybe three blocks up

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.160 
go up make it be maybe three blocks up
then<00:01:52.090> I'm<00:01:52.270> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.420> select<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.929> part

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
then I'm going to select the part

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.380 
then I'm going to select the part
underneath<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.770> control<00:01:54.729> C<00:01:54.970> control<00:01:55.000> V

you<00:02:10.330> accidentally<00:02:10.869> messed<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.349> just<00:02:11.709> do

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
you accidentally messed up just do

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.059 
you accidentally messed up just do
control<00:02:12.250> Z<00:02:13.080> until<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.319> goes<00:02:14.470> back<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:17.530> go<00:02:17.860> up

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
control Z until it goes back just go up

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.400 
control Z until it goes back just go up
I<00:02:19.890> move<00:02:20.890> one<00:02:21.040> over<00:02:21.160> here<00:02:23.099> make<00:02:24.099> another<00:02:24.370> one

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
I move one over here make another one

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.479 
I move one over here make another one
except<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.680> will<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:27.069> our<00:02:27.549> door<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:30.310> about

this tall change it to brown the
material<00:02:34.660> will<00:02:34.870> be<00:02:35.019> wood<00:02:35.350> we'll<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.579> nice

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
material will be wood we'll have a nice

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.420 
material will be wood we'll have a nice
wooden<00:02:37.120> door<00:02:37.290> when<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.410> go<00:02:38.530> down<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:38.920> you'll

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
wooden door when we go down more you'll

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640 
wooden door when we go down more you'll
see<00:02:39.670> an<00:02:39.730> option<00:02:39.880> called<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.480> collide

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
see an option called can collide

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.759 
see an option called can collide
let's<00:02:42.400> first<00:02:42.640> anchor<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.420> uncheck<00:02:43.780> it

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
let's first anchor it then uncheck it

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.250 
let's first anchor it then uncheck it
what<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.880> collide<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.359> is<00:02:46.630> when<00:02:47.140> your
