the short ram air intake testing you may
want<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> check<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:11.940> as<00:00:12.210> that's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
want to check that out first as that's

where i'm going to be pulling the test
data<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> stock<00:00:16.230> run<00:00:16.560> i<00:00:16.590> actually

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
data from for the stock run i actually

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.980 
data from for the stock run i actually
use<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> same<00:00:17.609> stock<00:00:17.880> run<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.539> i<00:00:18.660> installed

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
use the same stock run that i installed

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
use the same stock run that i installed
the<00:00:19.080> short<00:00:19.320> ram<00:00:19.410> air<00:00:19.590> intake<00:00:19.859> took<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> out

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the short ram air intake took that out

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400 
the short ram air intake took that out
installed<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> cold<00:00:21.390> air<00:00:21.539> intake<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.020> then

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
installed the cold air intake and then

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.700 
installed the cold air intake and then
ran<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> testing<00:00:23.100> again<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.619> what<00:00:25.619> we're

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
ran the testing again so what we're

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.170 
ran the testing again so what we're
going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.949> looking<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.400> different<00:00:27.090> rpm

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
going to be looking at different rpm

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080 
going to be looking at different rpm
ranges<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.170> test<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.680> now<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> temperature

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ranges to test out now the temperature

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
ranges to test out now the temperature
and<00:00:30.150> humidity<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.840> run<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> managed<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and humidity for this run I managed to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.870 
and humidity for this run I managed to
get<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> temperature<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> exact<00:00:32.610> same<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
get the temperature of the exact same I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
get the temperature of the exact same I
waited<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:33.630> time<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.960> day<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> test

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
waited for the right time of day to test

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790 
waited for the right time of day to test
the<00:00:34.860> humidity<00:00:35.370> was<00:00:35.640> off<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> bit<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.649> 56%<00:00:37.649> for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the humidity was off a bit so 56% for

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.430 
the humidity was off a bit so 56% for
the<00:00:37.890> stock<00:00:38.100> run<00:00:38.899> 72%<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> cold<00:00:40.260> air

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the stock run 72% for the cold air

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
the stock run 72% for the cold air
intake<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.070> let's<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.460> started<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
intake so let's get started with the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
intake so let's get started with the
second<00:00:42.930> gear<00:00:43.110> run<00:00:43.410> from<00:00:43.680> 20<00:00:43.950> miles<00:00:44.100> an<00:00:44.280> hour<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
second gear run from 20 miles an hour to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:57.540 
second gear run from 20 miles an hour to
40<00:00:44.820> miles<00:00:45.000> an<00:00:45.210> hour

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.610 

so<00:00:58.550> for<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:58.820> cold<00:00:59.000> air<00:00:59.180> intake<00:00:59.630> a<00:00:59.840> time<00:01:00.350> of

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
so for the cold air intake a time of

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.410 
so for the cold air intake a time of
2.84<00:01:01.400> seconds<00:01:01.940> that's<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.240> average<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.040> 0.97%

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
2.84 seconds that's the average so 0.97%

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.060 
2.84 seconds that's the average so 0.97%
faster<00:01:05.420> about<00:01:05.600> 1%<00:01:05.960> faster<00:01:06.560> than<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> stock

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
faster about 1% faster than the stock

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.520 
faster about 1% faster than the stock
air<00:01:07.310> intake<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.420> mid<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.750> high<00:01:08.780> rpm<00:01:09.290> range

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
air intake in the mid to high rpm range

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.740 
air intake in the mid to high rpm range
when<00:01:09.770> going<00:01:09.920> from<00:01:10.160> 20<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.460> 40<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.000> second<00:01:11.540> gear

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
when going from 20 to 40 in second gear

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.530 
when going from 20 to 40 in second gear
so<00:01:12.230> let's<00:01:12.500> check<00:01:12.740> out<00:01:12.890> third<00:01:13.160> year<00:01:13.430> 20<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:13.820> 40

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.730 

[Music]

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 

so<00:01:32.310> an<00:01:32.520> average<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> cold<00:01:33.450> air

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so an average time for the cold air

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
so an average time for the cold air
intake<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.530> 20<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> 40<00:01:35.430> mile-per-hour

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
intake in the 20 to 40 mile-per-hour

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.149 
intake in the 20 to 40 mile-per-hour
range<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.600> third<00:01:36.900> gear<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> lower

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
range for third gear this is the lower

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
range for third gear this is the lower
rpm<00:01:38.729> range<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.530> 4.61

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
rpm range of 4.61

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.149 
rpm range of 4.61
this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> almost<00:01:41.670> 4%<00:01:42.090> slower<00:01:42.990> than<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.920> stock

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
this is almost 4% slower than the stock

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.600 
this is almost 4% slower than the stock
air<00:01:44.400> intake<00:01:44.670> system<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.450> significantly<00:01:46.200> worse

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
air intake system so significantly worse

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.800 
air intake system so significantly worse
so<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.940> aren't<00:01:48.119> looking<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.690> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so things aren't looking good for the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.540 
so things aren't looking good for the
cold<00:01:49.020> air<00:01:49.200> intake<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.979> we're<00:01:50.190> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.400> take

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
cold air intake but we're going to take

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.880 
cold air intake but we're going to take
a<00:01:50.580> look<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> low<00:01:51.390> mid<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.810> high<00:01:52.020> rpm<00:01:52.680> Rev

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
a look at the low mid and high rpm Rev

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
a look at the low mid and high rpm Rev
ranges<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.610> did<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.210> acceleration<00:01:54.840> test<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
ranges I did an acceleration test in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.520 
ranges I did an acceleration test in
second<00:01:55.770> gear<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.070> 2000<00:01:56.670> rpm<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.570> 6000<00:01:58.200> rpm

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
second gear from 2000 rpm to 6000 rpm

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
second gear from 2000 rpm to 6000 rpm
and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:59.100> broke<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.759> individual<00:02:00.210> times

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and then broke out the individual times

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230 
and then broke out the individual times
for<00:02:01.200> each<00:02:01.259> rpm<00:02:01.740> range<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.880> see<00:02:03.090> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
for each rpm range so we can see you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.359 
for each rpm range so we can see you
know<00:02:03.360> how<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> affecting<00:02:04.140> each<00:02:04.679> individual

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
know how is it affecting each individual

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
know how is it affecting each individual
rpm<00:02:05.820> range<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.450> let's<00:02:06.600> go<00:02:06.720> ahead<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.259> check

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
rpm range so let's go ahead and check

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:17.620 
rpm range so let's go ahead and check
out<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.649> video

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.040 

so<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.670> cool<00:02:27.850> results<00:02:28.360> when<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.720> break<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
so very cool results when you break it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.360 
so very cool results when you break it
down<00:02:29.080> by<00:02:29.230> RPM<00:02:30.190> range<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.410> 1.33<00:02:32.410> for<00:02:32.740> stock<00:02:33.100> in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
down by RPM range so 1.33 for stock in

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.990 
down by RPM range so 1.33 for stock in
the<00:02:33.490> low<00:02:33.640> RPM<00:02:34.120> range<00:02:34.300> versus<00:02:34.780> 1.36<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the low RPM range versus 1.36 for the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.580 
the low RPM range versus 1.36 for the
cold<00:02:37.210> air<00:02:37.360> intake<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.260> gives<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
cold air intake and this gives you a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.280 
cold air intake and this gives you a
negative<00:02:38.920> two<00:02:39.250> point<00:02:39.550> two<00:02:39.850> seven<00:02:40.290> percent

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
negative two point two seven percent

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.080 
negative two point two seven percent
difference<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.130> cold<00:02:42.340> air<00:02:42.490> intake<00:02:42.820> two

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
difference so the cold air intake two

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.930 
difference so the cold air intake two
point<00:02:43.360> three<00:02:43.630> percent<00:02:43.840> slower<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.940> 2000

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.370 
to 3000 RPM rev range now one thing i
want<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.790> note<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.290> know

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
want to note just so if you you know

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.480 
want to note just so if you you know
want<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> back<00:02:50.740> calculate<00:02:50.980> some<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.400> these

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
want to back calculate some of these

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.250 
want to back calculate some of these
numbers<00:02:51.670> these<00:02:52.330> here<00:02:52.660> are<00:02:52.810> rounded<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
numbers these here are rounded to the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620 
numbers these here are rounded to the
nearest<00:02:53.380> hundred<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.850> when<00:02:55.030> i<00:02:55.060> calculate<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
nearest hundred but when i calculate the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.420 
nearest hundred but when i calculate the
percent<00:02:55.990> difference<00:02:56.200> i<00:02:56.650> used<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.250> full

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
percent difference i used the full

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.830 
percent difference i used the full
number<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.880> i<00:02:57.910> had<00:02:58.150> for<00:02:58.360> each<00:02:58.390> one<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.660> these

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
number that i had for each one of these

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.170 
number that i had for each one of these
so<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.709> may<00:02:59.830> look<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.310> bit<00:03:00.700> different

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
so it may look a little bit different

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.510 
so it may look a little bit different
but<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.230> calculated<00:03:02.920> using<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.340> full

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
but it is calculated using the full

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.850 
but it is calculated using the full
number<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:04.000> which<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.720> based<00:03:05.050> on<00:03:05.230> 120

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
number that I have which is based on 120

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.470 
number that I have which is based on 120
frames<00:03:05.980> per<00:03:06.220> second<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.820> taking<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.239> number

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
frames per second and taking the number

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.380 
frames per second and taking the number
of<00:03:07.570> frames<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.680> anyways<00:03:09.370> looking<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.209> mid

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
of frames so anyways looking to the mid

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.630 
of frames so anyways looking to the mid
rpm<00:03:10.600> range<00:03:11.140> we're<00:03:11.890> looking<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> percent

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
rpm range we're looking at a percent

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.250 
rpm range we're looking at a percent
difference<00:03:12.730> at<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.180> point<00:03:13.330> three<00:03:13.600> percent<00:03:13.780> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
difference at one point three percent so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.100 
difference at one point three percent so
the<00:03:14.380> cold<00:03:14.560> air<00:03:14.739> intake<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.730> 3000<00:03:16.270> 4000<00:03:16.780> rpm

per a hour p.m. Rev range is actually

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.530

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.300 
1.3 percent faster for the high rpm rev
range<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:23.020> is<00:03:23.080> where<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:23.470> cold<00:03:23.739> air<00:03:23.950> intake

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
range this is where this cold air intake

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.699 
range this is where this cold air intake
is<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.790> starting<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.239> shine<00:03:25.470> four<00:03:26.470> point

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
is really starting to shine four point

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.610

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
5,000 rpm rev range so pretty impressive

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.650 
5,000 rpm rev range so pretty impressive
there<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.130> three<00:03:33.760> point<00:03:34.000> oh<00:03:34.120> eight<00:03:34.150> percent

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
there and three point oh eight percent

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.680 
there and three point oh eight percent
faster<00:03:35.049> in<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.230> 5k<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> 6<00:03:36.220> K<00:03:36.489> Rev<00:03:37.030> range<00:03:37.299> so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
faster in the 5k to 6 K Rev range so

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.860 
faster in the 5k to 6 K Rev range so
significant<00:03:38.260> improvement<00:03:38.799> on<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.370> high<00:03:39.489> end

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
significant improvement on the high end

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.900 
significant improvement on the high end
worse<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.470> low<00:03:41.620> end<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.040> fact<00:03:42.310> much<00:03:42.640> worse

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
worse on the low end in fact much worse

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.870 
worse on the low end in fact much worse
in<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.480> very<00:03:43.660> low<00:03:43.840> end<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.320> you<00:03:44.470> know

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
in the very low end this is you know

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.330 
in the very low end this is you know
1500<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.000> around<00:03:46.269> 3,000<00:03:46.780> or<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:46.930> rpm<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.739> four

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
1500 to around 3,000 or so rpm so four

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.100 
1500 to around 3,000 or so rpm so four
percent<00:03:48.700> slower<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.720> what<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.870> can

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
percent slower there but what you can

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.150 
percent slower there but what you can
see<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.560> there<00:03:50.709> actually<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:51.040> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
see is that there actually is a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.580 
see is that there actually is a
significant<00:03:52.150> improvement<00:03:52.690> for<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:52.989> high<00:03:53.200> rpm

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
significant improvement for the high rpm

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.229 
significant improvement for the high rpm
rev<00:03:53.799> range<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.580> what<00:03:54.850> are<00:03:54.970> our<00:03:55.000> conclusions

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
rev range so what are our conclusions

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.970 
rev range so what are our conclusions
when<00:03:55.989> should<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.200> use<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.470> cold<00:03:56.769> air<00:03:56.950> intake

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
when should you use a cold air intake

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.949 
when should you use a cold air intake
well<00:03:57.850> if<00:03:58.060> it's<00:03:58.239> for<00:03:58.390> your<00:03:58.510> car<00:03:58.720> that's

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
well if it's for your car that's

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.810 
well if it's for your car that's
specifically<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.560> drag<00:03:59.829> car<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.310> track<00:04:00.579> car

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
specifically a drag car or a track car

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.370 
specifically a drag car or a track car
it<00:04:01.120> makes<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.510> lot<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.660> sense<00:04:01.959> because<00:04:02.290> you're

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
it makes a lot of sense because you're

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.170 
it makes a lot of sense because you're
going<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.590> be<00:04:02.799> keeping<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.310> in<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.549> higher<00:04:03.700> rpm

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
going to be keeping it in the higher rpm

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.729 
going to be keeping it in the higher rpm
rev<00:04:04.360> range<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.900> you're<00:04:05.230> going<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.410> get<00:04:05.560> that

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
rev range and you're going to get that

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.729 
rev range and you're going to get that
acceleration<00:04:06.220> benefit<00:04:06.940> now<00:04:07.570> that<00:04:08.140> said<00:04:08.500> if

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
acceleration benefit now that said if

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.289 
acceleration benefit now that said if
it's<00:04:09.130> your<00:04:09.280> daily<00:04:09.459> driver<00:04:09.910> where<00:04:10.209> you're

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
it's your daily driver where you're

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.819 
it's your daily driver where you're
going<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.480> be<00:04:10.570> staying<00:04:10.810> in<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.019> lower<00:04:11.170> RPM<00:04:11.620> rev

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
going to be staying in the lower RPM rev

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.620 
going to be staying in the lower RPM rev
range<00:04:12.040> you're<00:04:12.459> going<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.670> be<00:04:12.730> losing<00:04:12.940> power<00:04:13.120> so

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
range you're going to be losing power so

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.660 
range you're going to be losing power so
it<00:04:13.720> doesn't<00:04:13.989> make<00:04:14.110> much<00:04:14.290> sense<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.739> do<00:04:14.890> when<00:04:15.640> I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
it doesn't make much sense to do when I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.460 
it doesn't make much sense to do when I
was<00:04:15.940> using<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.419> integrants<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.019> daily<00:04:17.229> driver

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
was using my integrants and daily driver

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.490 
was using my integrants and daily driver
I'd<00:04:17.709> rarely<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:18.400> above<00:04:18.609> 3000<00:04:19.180> rpm<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.780> as<00:04:20.290> you

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
I'd rarely get above 3000 rpm and as you

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'd rarely get above 3000 rpm and as you
can<00:04:20.620> see<00:04:20.680> 3,000<00:04:21.489> rpm<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:21.970> come<00:04:22.150> up<00:04:22.270> below<00:04:22.570> it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
can see 3,000 rpm to come up below it

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.219 
can see 3,000 rpm to come up below it
everything<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.500> slower<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.660> daily<00:04:26.020> driver

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
everything is slower so for daily driver

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.750 
everything is slower so for daily driver
it<00:04:26.350> doesn't<00:04:26.590> make<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> whole<00:04:26.919> lot<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.220> sense<00:04:27.520> if

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense if

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.850 
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense if
it's<00:04:28.000> purely<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.419> track<00:04:28.750> car<00:04:28.990> where<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.710> want

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
it's purely a track car where you want

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.469 
it's purely a track car where you want
to<00:04:29.919> take<00:04:30.070> advantage<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.700> higher<00:04:30.910> rpm<00:04:31.300> rev

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
to take advantage of that higher rpm rev

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.490 
to take advantage of that higher rpm rev
range<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.900> that's<00:04:32.020> where<00:04:32.140> you're<00:04:32.260> gonna<00:04:32.320> be

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
range and that's where you're gonna be

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.409 
range and that's where you're gonna be
staying<00:04:32.800> then<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.520> does<00:04:33.669> make<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> lot<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.120> sense

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
staying then it does make a lot of sense

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.240 
staying then it does make a lot of sense
