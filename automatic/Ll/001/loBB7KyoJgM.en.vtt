I was editing this is the Edit of the
book<00:02:38.750> trailer<00:02:39.050> before<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.770> had<00:02:40.250> rendered<00:02:40.670> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
book trailer before I had rendered it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.330 
book trailer before I had rendered it
and<00:02:40.940> made<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.180> into<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.420> final<00:02:41.750> copy<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:43.220> now

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
and made it into a final copy right now

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.310 
and made it into a final copy right now
you<00:02:43.400> can<00:02:43.640> see<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:44.030> says<00:02:44.240> like<00:02:44.450> media<00:02:44.870> offline

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
you can see it says like media offline

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.230 
you can see it says like media offline
that's<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.490> move<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.000> files

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
that's just because I move the files

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.120 
that's just because I move the files
around<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.050> they're<00:02:48.260> no<00:02:48.470> longer<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
around so they're no longer in the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
around so they're no longer in the
correct<00:02:49.370> location<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.600> can<00:02:50.810> kind<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.110> see
