00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.810
 I'm going to go crazy 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.200
 It is a child and shorter working hours that would break 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.960
 I think it's quite difficult but 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.560

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.450

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.010
 The real's Nemaa 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.629
 Put a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.230
 It's charging time of 30 minutes dot resolution 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.640

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.890
 It's about charging though 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.890
 In the controller 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.080
 I say this a copter tongue 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.340
 High 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.910
 Well, it's a plug and then a type that charges 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.170

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.170
 Hey, I'm 10-years 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.490
 While charging 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.340
 This green lamp 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:41.100

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:44.330
 Sound intake Kugane of the place of the charged do is I ne little cat of the plug, such that I have the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.700

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:55.030
 Please plug in properly 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:58.959
 It looks like it is necessary to confirm whether the green lamp is on or not. 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:03.240
 Definitely how many times in practice now 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:05.080

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.490
 Easy easy ah 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.319
 It 's still difficult to take a while while I'm flying 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.590
 I can't wait for a while this time 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.130

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.350

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 I'm flying 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.480

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.920
 I'm flying with my kids, I tried to play, but 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.510

 It can be fun to play a 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.610

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.300

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.300
