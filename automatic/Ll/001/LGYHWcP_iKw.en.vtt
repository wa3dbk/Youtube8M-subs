00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 i have to take care of the haggard you can 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.960
 to bite extra with the fish 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.179
 I fought for about 35 minutes 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:21.650
 that was in the south of France on the small 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.650
 rhone 1 2 meter 35 waller 90 kilo heavy 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.430
 if we are lucky we meet 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.830
 today also such a monstrosity peter 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.290
 merkl the world hunter has heard him 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.540
 last eight the huge splash as 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.379
 The ball after his prey jumped there 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.379
 he wants to go 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.740
 in two hours the twilight begins 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.840
 hunter's time neckar somewhere 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.360
 between eberbach and hirschhorn the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.489
 chuck distance of a large balazs the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.489
 merkel has been following for three nights 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.190
 it is always the case, for example 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.350
 no people come here is not 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.510
 away or so here he chooses his rest 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.400
 he can hide here and that 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.400
 are actually also encountered hotspots 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.710
 There is no fish species in the fresh water 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.479
 in germany where so big 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.630
 can and that's fascinated shut 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.530
 size the strength of the hidden and it 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.869
 is the king of fishermen 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.300
 who wants to catch him must outsmart him 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.450
 merkel has a lot of experience with it 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.820
 that's what protects the bait 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.190
 fish develops more smell in the water 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.310
 that's a bit bloody we're running 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.110
 have an excellent sense of smell 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 injured fish waterfowl and carcasses 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.880
 They smell over long distances 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.979
 that's not normal Kapisa 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.259
 can resist 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.990
 trick numero two of the bait has to go far 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.420
 away from the boat because the wallach is everything 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.360
 the throw of the anchor and the steps of the anchor 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.009
 will ban anglers in the boat near 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.349
 never turn to us once 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.450
 That's why I have inflatable boat around 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.830
 the montage and my body so far 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.739
 to draw as possible 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.989
 Peter Merkel is one for the big ones 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.690
 fish the eberbacher writes for 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.090
 angler magazine and works as an author 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.670
 guide throughout europe his best friend 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:36.060
 Terry Ahn Ton hunting always with the beautiful 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.060
 is done 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.709
 to have some meat and rest 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.270
 on 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.450
 And so you wait an hour and a half 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:51.879
 hours just under two hours then it does 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:56.489
 suddenly fighting for 20 minutes now 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.489
 Merkel and the world then it's time 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:25.419
 1 meter 70 tall 40 kilo heavy that was 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.669
 a really great in a normal 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.669
 However, he does not fit frying pan
