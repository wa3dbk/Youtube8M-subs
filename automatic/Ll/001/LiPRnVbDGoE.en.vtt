moles to my foot well apparently what's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.920 
moles to my foot well apparently what's
supposed<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.350> add<00:03:57.410> with<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.740> kobe<00:03:58.130> 6<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.640> that

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
supposed to add with the kobe 6 is that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.310 
supposed to add with the kobe 6 is that
the<00:03:59.930> shoe<00:04:00.230> will<00:04:00.560> mode<00:04:00.830> will<00:04:01.400> mold<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.320> fit

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
the shoe will mode will mold to the fit

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.610 
the shoe will mode will mold to the fit
of<00:04:03.350> your<00:04:03.740> foot<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.000> if<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.720> happens<00:04:06.230> in<00:04:06.500> these

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
of your foot so if that happens in these

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.800 
of your foot so if that happens in these
shoes<00:04:06.890> will<00:04:07.250> become<00:04:07.550> even<00:04:07.880> more<00:04:07.910> comfortable

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
shoes will become even more comfortable

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.330 
shoes will become even more comfortable
