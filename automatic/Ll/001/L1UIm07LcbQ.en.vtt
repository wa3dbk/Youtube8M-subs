00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.020
 as in this case it can not be 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.020
 we put a diagonal position 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.260

 3 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.909
 then we roll a towel 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.659
 around the companion neck it 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.010
 about to help me 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.030
 next 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.030
 we put the uni 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.310
 we see a channel towards the lever so that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.320
 all the water and all the soap go towards 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 there 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.160
 with a life 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 plastic towel found that 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.680
 do not leave any soap residue to the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 neck 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.310
 next 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.020
 we take the jug of water always 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.110
 trying to ask if the temperature 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 of the water is suitable for her pink I have 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.860
 take a little water to see what you 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.560
 It seems that tastes are good too 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.030
 they are always trying to cover their eyes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360
 so that the water tax does not go 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.050
 when he told me that if they like us 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.950
 we will see to throw a little water 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.950
 we soap 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.400
 and then we proceed to do the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.810
 hair wash always a massage that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.810
 always good for circulation 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.610
 we make a first clarification 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.020
 we give it back a little ham 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.020
 we keep a second now we're going 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.310
 well you liked trying not to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.680
 the ears go to the eyes 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.680
 what we owe to a second clarified 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 once it is clear we discover what 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 maximum possible 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.090
 we take a towel 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.080
 we roll up well then we remove 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.080
 Monday 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.189
 and the towel does not go around the neck 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.240
 then 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.990
 we put another towel as a second the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.990
 second dryer 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.470
 and we try to incorporate the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.530
 with the army and we will pass 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.830
 a herd of the same 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.950
 very well we cover so that later to run 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.500
 fluted 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.240
 how well rose in state 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.630
 we try to always put them in a position 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.450
 comfortable for her and if you have hair 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.950
 very long we can put another remove 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.750
 this and we put another towel 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.000
 so that it does not stain dye and so 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.150
 usually have dye or water remains 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.470
 in the new one below 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.470
 we proceed to the hairstyle 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.800
 if you have a little bit long the best is 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.020
 Take out your hair so it does not get cold and 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.200
 good 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.870
 if you have very short and there are 983 do not 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.020
 annoying does not bother him because he is left without 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.380
 dry but good the back 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.120
 same many times better 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.060
 I do not think there is so much humidity 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.880
 we can use a hair dryer 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.340
 also once it is incorporated and 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.940
 in its place and comfortable because we want to 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.940
 pick up the material 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.550
 and we remove the names and write down 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.550
 the incidents that we could have
