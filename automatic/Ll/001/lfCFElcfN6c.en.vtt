 So after that attach it to the bike body 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:15.219
 I about this two It is work we introduce air cleaner cold noodles and the null oil 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.080
 It is dedicated to 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:25.720
 When using Ryo Ryo and when using a common oil 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 This time, it is general without using air clean noodles and special oil. 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.130
 I would like to use oil 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:40.710
 This crm 250 r is not genuine as it is usually 2 st oil 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 I'm using Ultra gr 2 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.660
 It is a plan, too, this element older brother null oil is also 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 I will use this oil as well 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:01:00.080
 After hanging the sales methods It is is that first oil of the oil to the element 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.080
 You using the method that will dazzle your hands is the ne oil 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.479
 It is hard to judge how much I need to shift the medical care to the main 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.030
 But it is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.700
 As a point I pinch the air cleaner element and the oil is a little high 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.610
 It is up to that extent 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.490
 It is recommended that Tteyuu go painted oil 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 If you apply oil to the element, it will be a grandson after dropping oil to multiple locations. 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.440
 The person is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.590
 You can make the oil penetrate the entire air cleaner element 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.820
 After the or the I's in the entire air cleaner element oil 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:46.420
 I will attach it to the base when I choose the air cleaner . 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:48.610
 If this attachment is attached diagonally, you may be in the form of an officer, and the level will be 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.050
 Without sticking 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:58.360
 To So will contain It is from the gap dust 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:04.240
 It is better to go here carefully if you have a crm plant that you are using this time 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:10.000
 There is a protrusion in the middle of the air cleaner case that element on that protrusion 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:15.910
 Align the hole in the middle of is a way of multiplying the last it is the topper 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.160
 When the work is over , attach the lid of the air cleaner case and the work is complete 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.410
 A common failure is the ne air cleaner element of that attachment is Naa a app 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.820
 Not in close contact with the case 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.870
 It is often from the middle that air gets in 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:37.900
 In this case it is very easy to understand if you hear the sound 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.549
 Well, if you attach a few air cleaner elements, the intake noise will be very loud . 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.879
 I will be small but 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:48.190
 It is here and if there is a gap , the intake sound sky today sounds like it will be considerably louder. 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.400
 It is the case of rm 250 r 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.860
 And the act is it sound to say Po method people matter 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 Himself 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.900
 It is as a test what kind of sound is made with a motorcycle 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.020
 Kick with the air cleaner element removed 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.930
 Or it's time to call it 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.800
 I will turn off the kill switch on the engine I taste of vinegar The engine is from the mouth piston 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.880
 It is only 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.040
 Turn by kick or sele 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.240
 By properly listening to the air cleaner element by listening to that day 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 It is not time 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.390
 You can check the photo 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.380
 In this way if you check your bike's condition 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:33.330
 For example, when a bike falls and is caused 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.860
 So you can early detection even when the air cleaner Les such vent deviates 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.660
 It is engine technique 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:47.220
 You will be able to prevent the troubles that can be seen in the air of the air and the pride of the dirty air 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.220
