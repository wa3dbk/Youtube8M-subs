00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello friends maybe if today we make a 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.459
 risotto with mushrooms of season one 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.290
 super simple recipe that is going to 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.490
 allow the chef to take out that all 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.299
 we carry inside 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:20.830
 let's start we need garlic onion 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:25.220
 carrot leek celery wine white water 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.470
 olive oil butter thyme salt 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.320
 fresh parmesan cheese grated cheese 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.960
 mascarpone truffle oil mushrooms 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.580
 season and rice 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.830
 We begin preparing broth 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.920
 vegetables we put in a pot half 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.500
 onion cleans a leek two carrots 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 two branches of celery a liter and a half 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.930
 salt water and cook for 20 minutes 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.420
 when it's ready we put it in and what 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.670
 we reserve now we continue with the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.890
 vegetables for the risotto we cut a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 onion as thin as possible we grate a 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.660
 garlic and with a brush we clean the mushrooms 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.390
 of the land they may also have 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.339
 we can use frozen mushrooms but I 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.100
 I recommend fresh mushrooms that are going to give 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.080
 better taste of rice then 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.240
 the pot on the fire with a mixture of 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.790
 oil and butter with which we are going to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.009
 get a perfect creaminess 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.770
 once melted we will put the onion and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.560
 the garlic when poached is the moment 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.200
 to add the mushrooms and sautÃ© 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.170
 the rice calculate 100 grams per person 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.539
 As you can see, I'm using brilliant abro 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 a round rice that always stays in its 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.110
 we mix well we put the fire 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.600
 medium-high and we toss the white wine 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.710
 from now on we count 18 minutes 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 we stir and let reduce the wine 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.909
 then we will add little by little 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.420
 hot broth while stirring like this 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.909
 the rice is releasing starch the good thing about 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 this rice is that it is more resistant 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.520
 that's why the grain does not break and the plate 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.219
 it remains with a creamy texture 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.259
 when the time passes we will put a little 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.990
 of parmesan cheese and mascarpone cheese 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.939
 that will give us creaminess we also add 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.240
 a stream quoted small of oil 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.610
 truffle we mix well and that's it 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.190
 I hope you liked the recipe and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 you feel encouraged to make yourselves and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.150
 you will see how with bright rice the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 rice has no mystery
