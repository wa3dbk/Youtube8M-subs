00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.760 
so I thought I'd do one here quick
before<00:00:15.730> I<00:00:15.759> put<00:00:16.330> it<00:00:16.420> into<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.779> pines<00:00:17.050> mudroom

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
before I put it into the pines mudroom

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.630 
before I put it into the pines mudroom
show<00:00:18.189> room

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
show room

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.089 
show room

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
now basically how this took off is we

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.310 
now basically how this took off is we
had<00:00:21.279> a<00:00:21.310> few<00:00:21.700> guerrilla<00:00:22.599> silver-backed

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
had a few guerrilla silver-backed

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.089 
had a few guerrilla silver-backed
takeoffs<00:00:23.919> on<00:00:24.130> these<00:00:24.279> nice<00:00:24.489> SS<00:00:25.029> rims<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:26.099> just

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
takeoffs on these nice SS rims and just

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.880 
takeoffs on these nice SS rims and just
wanted<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:28.869> them<00:00:29.079> up<00:00:29.169> or<00:00:29.410> see<00:00:29.559> what<00:00:29.710> they

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
wanted to use them up or see what they

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.639 
wanted to use them up or see what they
would<00:00:30.009> basically<00:00:30.220> fit<00:00:30.790> on<00:00:31.029> this<00:00:31.720> 1000<00:00:32.529> so<00:00:32.619> we

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
would basically fit on this 1000 so we

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.000 
would basically fit on this 1000 so we
put<00:00:32.920> them<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.190> quick<00:00:34.079> along<00:00:35.079> with<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.350> one<00:00:35.800> inch

put them on quick along with a one inch
spring<00:00:36.430> spacer<00:00:36.910> gave<00:00:37.090> us<00:00:37.240> about<00:00:37.420> two<00:00:37.690> inches

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
spring spacer gave us about two inches

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.830 
spring spacer gave us about two inches
of<00:00:38.140> lift<00:00:38.290> onto<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.240> yeah<00:00:40.240> they<00:00:40.420> fit<00:00:40.600> right

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
of lift onto it and yeah they fit right

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.630 
of lift onto it and yeah they fit right
on<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.260> played<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.710> little<00:00:41.920> bit<00:00:42.130> with<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.400> sway

bar the detachable sway bar on the back
end<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:44.890> unhooked<00:00:45.340> it<00:00:45.490> and<00:00:45.730> made<00:00:46.030> sure<00:00:46.060> we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
end here unhooked it and made sure we

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.520 
end here unhooked it and made sure we
had<00:00:46.300> lots<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.690> clearance<00:00:47.080> we're<00:00:47.290> still

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
had lots of clearance we're still

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.100 
had lots of clearance we're still
sitting<00:00:47.890> with<00:00:48.010> about<00:00:48.250> that<00:00:48.460> that<00:00:49.300> one<00:00:49.600> inch<00:00:49.870> in

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
sitting with about that that one inch in

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.960 
sitting with about that that one inch in
between<00:00:50.470> these<00:00:50.590> two<00:00:50.829> tires<00:00:51.130> in<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.460> back<00:00:51.700> here

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
between these two tires in the back here

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.250 
between these two tires in the back here
and<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.120> was<00:00:52.270> what<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.510> were<00:00:52.600> really<00:00:52.810> worried

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
and that was what we were really worried

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.990 
and that was what we were really worried
about<00:00:53.320> just<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:54.070> we<00:00:54.550> were<00:00:54.640> going<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.820> have

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
about just if we were going to have

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.330 
about just if we were going to have
enough<00:00:55.240> clearance<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:56.620> here<00:00:56.860> so<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.040> haven't

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
enough clearance right here so I haven't

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.890 
enough clearance right here so I haven't
even<00:00:57.400> trimmed<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.880> fenders<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.450> yet<00:00:58.720> it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
even trimmed the fenders on it yet it

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.110 
even trimmed the fenders on it yet it
would<00:00:58.989> like<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.560> give<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.489> fender<00:01:00.940> wells

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
would like to give the the fender wells

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.540 
would like to give the the fender wells
a<00:01:01.300> quick<00:01:01.560> trim<00:01:02.560> but<00:01:02.800> we<00:01:03.100> thought<00:01:03.250> we'd<00:01:03.399> put

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
a quick trim but we thought we'd put

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.530 
a quick trim but we thought we'd put
them<00:01:03.640> on<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:03.970> see<00:01:04.059> what<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.239> looks<00:01:04.449> like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
them on and see what it looks like

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.600 
them on and see what it looks like
looked<00:01:04.869> really<00:01:05.140> cool<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:06.009> thing<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.369> going

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
looked really cool this thing is going

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.490 
looked really cool this thing is going
to<00:01:06.670> be<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.820> tank<00:01:07.149> it'd<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.720> interesting<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.259> see

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
to be a tank it'd be interesting to see

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.860 
to be a tank it'd be interesting to see
what<00:01:08.710> what<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:09.760> would<00:01:09.940> go<00:01:10.090> through<00:01:10.420> of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
what what this would go through of

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.750 
what what this would go through of
course<00:01:11.170> they<00:01:11.380> are<00:01:11.530> snorkelled<00:01:12.070> up<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.520> pod

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
course they are snorkelled up to the pod

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.510 
course they are snorkelled up to the pod
and<00:01:13.510> be<00:01:13.659> nice<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.870> add<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.140> little<00:01:14.520> custom

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
and be nice to add a little custom

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.030 
and be nice to add a little custom
snorkel<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.780> maybe<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.050> rad<00:01:17.470> relocate

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
snorkel to it and maybe a rad relocate

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.219 
snorkel to it and maybe a rad relocate
kit<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:18.490> we'll<00:01:18.640> see<00:01:18.820> if<00:01:19.450> maybe<00:01:19.690> that's<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
kit so we'll see if maybe that's in the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.649 
kit so we'll see if maybe that's in the
future<00:01:20.620> for<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:20.950> machine<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.580> also<00:01:22.420> another

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
future for this machine and also another

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.719 
future for this machine and also another
cool<00:01:22.960> thing<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.159> low<00:01:24.310> gear<00:01:24.610> on

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
cool thing is that is the low gear on

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.310 
cool thing is that is the low gear on
the<00:01:24.850> transmission<00:01:25.330> on<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:25.750> thing<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.110> like<00:01:26.229> I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the transmission on this thing so like I

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.620 
the transmission on this thing so like I
said<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:27.460> would<00:01:27.640> be<00:01:27.790> really<00:01:28.150> neat<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.360> see

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
said it it would be really neat to see

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.910 
said it it would be really neat to see
what<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.870> would<00:01:28.990> go<00:01:29.140> through<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:29.680> new

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
what it would go through with this new

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.610 
what it would go through with this new
low<00:01:30.580> gear<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.150> 6x6<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> same<00:01:32.380> thing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
low gear and the 6x6 is the same thing

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.270 
low gear and the 6x6 is the same thing
that's<00:01:32.740> in<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.240> 1000s<00:01:34.240> mr<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.990> ya<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.220> to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
that's in the 1000s mr and ya going to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.490 
that's in the 1000s mr and ya going to
be<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.400> really<00:01:36.729> interesting<00:01:37.170> spring<00:01:38.170> once<00:01:38.380> we

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
be a really interesting spring once we

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.840 
be a really interesting spring once we
get<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.650> little<00:01:38.799> mud<00:01:39.040> rolling<00:01:39.369> around<00:01:39.430> here<00:01:39.670> and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
get a little mud rolling around here and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
get a little mud rolling around here and
see<00:01:40.030> what<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.240> thing<00:01:40.510> can<00:01:40.630> do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
see what this thing can do

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.440 
see what this thing can do
again<00:01:42.040> another<00:01:42.310> little<00:01:42.610> cool<00:01:43.030> thing<00:01:43.299> we'd

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
again another little cool thing we'd

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.910 
like to try out in the future is maybe
see<00:01:45.460> if<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.820> HMF<00:01:46.450> pipe<00:01:47.260> we<00:01:47.439> could<00:01:47.619> get<00:01:47.740> one

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
see if this HMF pipe we could get one

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.980 
see if this HMF pipe we could get one
