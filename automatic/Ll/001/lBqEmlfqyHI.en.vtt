00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
battered body shell the main bit is the

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.459 
battered body shell the main bit is the
rear<00:05:02.729> quarter<00:05:03.210> there<00:05:03.389> there's<00:05:03.960> lots<00:05:04.199> of<00:05:04.319> rot

rear quarter there there's lots of rot

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.779 
rear quarter there there's lots of rot
there's<00:05:04.680> a<00:05:04.710> few<00:05:04.860> bits<00:05:05.039> here<00:05:05.219> and<00:05:05.280> there<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.729> a

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
there's a few bits here and there and a

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.399 
there's a few bits here and there and a
couple<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.419> dents<00:05:06.569> it<00:05:06.750> won't<00:05:06.900> come<00:05:07.020> out<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.319> the

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
couple of dents it won't come out so the

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.040 
couple of dents it won't come out so the
easiest<00:05:07.710> thing<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.889> do<00:05:08.069> is<00:05:08.219> just<00:05:08.400> put<00:05:08.610> in<00:05:09.050> big

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
easiest thing to do is just put in big

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.010

Steve's been fixing up VW's for a while

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.969 
Steve's been fixing up VW's for a while
so<00:05:21.690> he<00:05:21.720> knows<00:05:21.930> how<00:05:22.110> best<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.530> tackle<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
so he knows how best to tackle the

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.939 
so he knows how best to tackle the
bodywork<00:05:26.840> doing<00:05:27.840> here<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.139> seems<00:05:28.440> absolute

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
bodywork doing here that seems absolute

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.760 
bodywork doing here that seems absolute
nightmare<00:05:29.069> because<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.240> made<00:05:30.599> up<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.990> lots

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
nightmare because it's made up of lots

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.710 
nightmare because it's made up of lots
and<00:05:31.979> lots<00:05:32.099> of<00:05:32.190> different<00:05:32.280> bits<00:05:32.599> see<00:05:33.599> the

and lots of different bits see the

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.809 
and lots of different bits see the
easiest<00:05:34.199> thing<00:05:34.319> to<00:05:34.349> do<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.740> let's<00:05:35.580> put<00:05:35.729> it

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
easiest thing to do is let's put it

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.260 
easiest thing to do is let's put it
across<00:05:36.030> here<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.569> across<00:05:37.729> down<00:05:38.729> there<00:05:39.030> and

across here and across down there and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.629 
across here and across down there and
then<00:05:39.389> you've<00:05:39.509> got<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:39.720> flat<00:05:40.139> surface<00:05:40.639> he

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
then you've got that flat surface he

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.490 
then you've got that flat surface he
picked<00:05:41.880> up<00:05:42.000> this<00:05:42.180> panel<00:05:42.569> for<00:05:42.599> 100<00:05:43.050> quid<00:05:43.259> a<00:05:43.289> few

picked up this panel for 100 quid a few

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.469 
picked up this panel for 100 quid a few
years<00:05:43.770> ago<00:05:43.889> it<00:05:44.639> was<00:05:44.729> bought<00:05:45.060> for<00:05:45.240> another

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
years ago it was bought for another

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.150 
years ago it was bought for another

could<00:06:15.210> consume<00:06:15.599> over<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.960> hundred<00:06:16.320> hours<00:06:16.470> so<00:06:16.860> a

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
could consume over a hundred hours so a
