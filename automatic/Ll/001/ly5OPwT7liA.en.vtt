00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello I'm jackie in this video we're going to 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.740
 see the room and whose version 3.1 I'm going to 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.139
 learn the cell phone so they can see 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.139
 what speed this room lights 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.800
 this rom with has android 4 points 4.3 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.410
 is based on cyanogenmod contains the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.470
 launcher google now and the launcher liquid 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.900
 the front and rear camera are 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 correct there is no problem has 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.000
 possibility of passing applications to the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.340
 sd card has a space of 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.940
 Available internal storage of 2 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 gigas approximately ram use less 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.309
 50% and is available for 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 models and 91 90 what is 3g and and 91 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.149
 95 what is the ether 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.750
 and learned the team let's see what 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.750
 the android version 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.880
 settings 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.549
 phone information 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.549
 we have android 4.4 points 3 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.719
 good within the options as already 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.130
 forgiveness within the settings as it is 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:38.710
 common in in these android versions 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.390
 we have this option 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.320
 this option called dark theme what 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.180
 that all he does is highlight 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.420
 give the impression that the colors are 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.520
 more alive but the black one costs you 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.640
 more at this moment he is active for 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.680
 that can see the difference 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.360
 the asset of the impression that the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.360
 colors were now more vivid 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 in this room the adjustments within the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 center of the same settings tab 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.730
 we find directly what is the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.650
 person personalization of the team both 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.510
 what competes for example the bar 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.140
 state 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.909
 the interface buttons the panel 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.620
 notifications all that is found 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.049
 inside the settings tab 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.420
 we simply have to enter what 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.640
 what are the adjustments and we are already 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.030
 within what is personalization 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.440
 very different from other roms that have 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.629
 a specific option with which 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.950
 we enter and they offer us all the adjustments 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.560
 of 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.459
 of customization in this case I'm 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.430
 directly here we find good what 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.540
 which is from the status bar and knows what 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.599
 that the clock 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.480
 and good what you already know 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.620
 can investigate this more thoroughly between 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.379
 an option by option and seeing that or 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.760
 in customization or configuration you 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.790
 would like to have 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.490
 I'm not going to go very deep in this video 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.340
 It will not be so long 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.069
 good about what it is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.510
 what is the camera I have not had any 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.430
 problem 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.360
 I have all my full options 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.069
 focused the front camera the back 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.540
 the autofocus has not been any 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.670
 problem 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.670
 so the camera is 100% 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.110
 the vote of some cases would appear to us 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.100
 then some applications of a 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.260
 button that 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.150
 that has the same functionality that 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.710
 this competitive button that opens us the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.850
 tab 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.850
 of configurations 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.960
 we enter 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.250
 in some in this case of this student 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.140
 has that option button since 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.700
 Physically recognizes that this is your 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.530
 Settings button is a lot of 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.640
 options but 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.000
 here inside what is this 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.459
 we enter the settings we see the adjustments 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.840
 of what the launcher is that in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.840
 this moment I have an active 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.820
 with respect to the autonomy of the site 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.610
 provides what I tried by making it a small 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.620
 test which consisted in seeing how much 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.860
 time was completely downloaded the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.270
 cellular until proven and good the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.590
 result that I got 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.590
 it was one day 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.140
 a day with nine hours and thirty minutes 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.370
 this was what lasted the battery but 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.979
 per se 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.800
 and a new one could last a little longer and 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.770
 what 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.940
 in the last hours I was testing 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.270
 from this room 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.440
 this has been a very intense and 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.180
 really that the battery gets a little 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.930
 more but 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.110
 if it is within normal limits that lasted a 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.689
 cellular since it is a day with nine hours 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.150
 almost practically almost two days 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.390
 with respect to 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.650
 to the branch we have after that that's more than 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.460
 enough for our applications 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.710
 heavy or requiring 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.140
 a lot were enough team resources 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.770
 in this case at this time if it is that 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.360
 I go see 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.360
 how much do I have 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.470
 I have practically almost a gig of 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.960
 free space and if I follow if I continue 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.659
 using the cell phone entering 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.560
 different applications and the whole ram does not 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:05.180
 exceeds 30 but does not exceed 50% of 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.969
 the use of the ram and that is something is something 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.479
 more than more than good more than enough 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.479
 for us 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.340
 and something that mentioned the beginning is that 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.289
 we have the option to be able to pass 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.699
 our applications 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.029
 our applications to what is the 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.939
 sd card here we already have the option and 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.800
 we simply enter anybody and 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:33.190
 we can move it to the sd card 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.080
 something new in what corresponds to what 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.449
 Regarding this new version of 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.790
 android 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.850
 good 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.030
 something something that has happened to me also with 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.120
 all this and that we need to improve or 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.930
 develop 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.780
 is that some applications both 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:56.150
 some games that I wanted to download 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.040
 where if the download goes but I do not 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.180
 allowed to install I got an error with 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.530
 about someone 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:07.110
 to this game to download which I 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.580
 I think it's something like the rup 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.610
 always constantly they are 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.860
 updating I know that no future in the 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.080
 developers are going to fix that but 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.169
 this happens only in some games not in 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.150
 all since I wanted to download 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:24.240
 some I could like others and could 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.660
 and good is a point where there is no 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.949
 to worry a lot since I said that 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.440
 they are constantly updating this 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:34.169
 of the rumba so it 's just that 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.350
 it remains to wait for the developers 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:39.450
 can improve this 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.980
 good in the description of this video 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.960
 will be the links so you can 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.970
 download this room 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.250
 and if you liked the video do not forget to give it 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.530
 a good like to add favorites 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.860
