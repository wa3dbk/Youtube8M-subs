difference between the two models

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.369 
difference between the two models
obviously<00:00:54.590> is<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.430> carbon<00:00:55.789> material<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.510> for

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
obviously is the carbon material and for

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.319 
obviously is the carbon material and for
me<00:00:57.469> personally<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.699> biggest<00:00:58.820> thing<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.180> i

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
me personally the biggest thing that i

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.599 
me personally the biggest thing that i
noticed<00:00:59.690> between<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.500> two<00:01:00.680> things<00:01:00.949> first<00:01:01.399> off

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
noticed between the two things first off

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.600 
noticed between the two things first off
is<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.879> weight<00:01:02.210> savings<00:01:03.040> being<00:01:04.040> over<00:01:04.340> a<00:01:04.370> pound

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
is the weight savings being over a pound

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.700 
is the weight savings being over a pound
and<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.760> half<00:01:04.790> lighter<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.870> much<00:01:06.080> snappier<00:01:06.380> on

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
and a half lighter it's much snappier on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.000 
and a half lighter it's much snappier on
trail<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.310> obviously<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.560> accelerates<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.740> lot

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
trail and obviously it accelerates a lot

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.090 
trail and obviously it accelerates a lot
quicker<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.550> in<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.330> sense<00:01:11.570> up<00:01:11.930> hills<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.500> lot

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
quicker in in a sense up hills a lot

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.980 
quicker in in a sense up hills a lot
easier<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.850> weight<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.420> frame<00:01:14.659> with<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
easier the weight of the frame with the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.490 
easier the weight of the frame with the
shock<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.820> 2,900<00:01:16.820> grams<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:18.290> it's<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
shock is 2,900 grams so it's a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.289 
shock is 2,900 grams so it's a
significant<00:01:19.159> weight<00:01:19.369> savings<00:01:20.030> over<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
significant weight savings over the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.020 
significant weight savings over the
alloy<00:01:20.600> model<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.200> 2016<00:01:22.070> carbon<00:01:22.700> control
