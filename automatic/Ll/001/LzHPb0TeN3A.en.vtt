00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.970
 disinformation and revolt is what most 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 the terminal in the area where it is 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 integration for buses 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.889
 intermunicipal services that serve the region of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.750
 abc is that the mt metropolitan company 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.940
 of urban transport from são paulo 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 changed the transport system 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 intermunicipal 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 with the end of the integration the users 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.640
 feel the difference in Sunday's pocket 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.160
 here were two changes 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.449
 one increases the bureaucracy and makes the user 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 waste time 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.280
 before who took a municipal bus in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 São Paulo could use the single ticket 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.290
 to integrate with the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.960
 intermunicipal terminals in the cabo 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.719
 now the user must also have the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.300
 card that operates on the lines of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.910
 buses in the 39 municipalities of the region 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 metropolitan of são paulo before 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.410
 boarding the two cards have to be 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 placed at the same time in these 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 validators to another change 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340
 directly into the worker's pocket 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.530
 the main problem that is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 happening here is the following user 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 that came here in the terminal Sacoma 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 subway and intended to take a bus 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 intermunicipal government paid only the difference 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.890
 rate ranging from 15 cents to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.350
 one real and sixty depending on the destination 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.689
 of the bus from Sunday this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 integration has ended the user arrives here 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.840
 by subway and to take the bus 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 intermunicipal 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.880
 he has to pay the full rate that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.100
 varies between three reais and forty 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.270
 cents and five reais 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 ah I think it's absurd because there I 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.500
 I'm going to pay instead of driving. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.680
 You're paying two condensate. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 this is cruel month-end gives a good 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 difference 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.250
 to mt the state government company 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.049
 responsible for transport 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.570
 metropolitan area claims that the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.840
 integration for subway users who 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.000
 for years was undue and that the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.969
 carried out an extensive communication 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.409
 for users is not what it seems 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.420
 yesterday was even a mess 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.470
 Damn on the bus at the time of the staff 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.750
 come back 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.990
 Because the staff was lost, I did not know 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.180
 that you have to have the single ticket right now 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.700
 this disclosure was not well done, e 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.730
 we did not even know the employee 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.560
 in charge of clarifying the doubts 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 states that it is difficult to deal with 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.000
 consumer revulsion is very 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.040
 confusing at first the user are not 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 understanding the difference because 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.830
 formerly a kind of benefit 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.700
 now not only attacking bravo until 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 threat of death
