00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

headlight so I saw I think a 5 Series
but<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.510> don't<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.230> anything<00:00:37.950> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but I don't think it was anything like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
but I don't think it was anything like
this<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.820> he<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> leave<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
this because he was able to leave the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.680 
this because he was able to leave the
front<00:00:40.290> bumper<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:46.160> just<00:00:47.360> got<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> day<00:00:48.660> off

front bumper on and I just got a day off
and<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:51.260> attacked<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> when<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> basically

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and and attacked it so when I basically

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.670 
and and attacked it so when I basically
did<00:00:56.719> on<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:59.670> mine<00:01:00.359> there's<00:01:00.780> four<00:01:01.109> screws<00:01:01.289> up

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

did on on mine there's four screws up
here<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.969> were<00:01:03.059> raised<00:01:03.420> either<00:01:03.960> those<00:01:04.409> were

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
here that were raised either those were

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.359 
here that were raised either those were
t30<00:01:06.170> torx<00:01:07.170> very<00:01:07.860> easy<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> take<00:01:08.340> off<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:10.369> very

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
t30 torx very easy to take off just very

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
t30 torx very easy to take off just very
simple<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:13.909> didn't<00:01:14.909> plan<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.119> recording<00:01:15.390> this

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
simple I didn't plan on recording this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
simple I didn't plan on recording this
so<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.979> why<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.850> apart

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
so that's why it's all the way apart

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
so that's why it's all the way apart
right<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.020> headlight<00:01:19.590> wasn't<00:01:20.040> or

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
right now the the headlight wasn't or

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
right now the the headlight wasn't or
the<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.270> ahead<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> corner<00:01:22.049> light<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the not ahead like the corner light this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
the not ahead like the corner light this
corner<00:01:23.220> light<00:01:23.400> had<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:25.100> melted<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:27.049> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
corner light had a melted the the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.520 
corner light had a melted the the
terminal<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.740> why<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.950> melted<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
terminal I don't know why it melted and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
terminal I don't know why it melted and
he<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.860> guess<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.159> pushed<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> away<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.700> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
he just I guess they pushed it away so I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.710 
he just I guess they pushed it away so I
wasn't<00:01:33.090> making<00:01:33.270> contact<00:01:33.630> anymore<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:35.689> shared<00:01:36.689> a

that<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:31.480> it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that was it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810 
that was it
it<00:02:33.700> was<00:02:33.880> annoying<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
it was annoying because this was in a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.560 
it was annoying because this was in a
way<00:02:37.230> basically<00:02:38.230> I'd<00:02:38.380> push<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.460> down<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.540> I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
way basically I'd push it down and I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.420 
way basically I'd push it down and I
look<00:02:43.570> like<00:02:43.720> one<00:02:43.930> goes<00:02:44.230> right<00:02:44.350> there<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
look like one goes right there and the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.450 
look like one goes right there and the
other<00:02:45.580> one<00:02:45.730> goes<00:02:45.880> over<00:02:46.240> there<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:48.040> that's<00:02:48.310> on

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
other one goes over there and that's on

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.480 
other one goes over there and that's on
both<00:02:48.640> sides<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:50.110> once<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.709> the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
both sides and once you do that the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.090 
both sides and once you do that the
bumper<00:02:52.209> come<00:02:52.450> right<00:02:52.600> off<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.770> can<00:02:53.920> just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
bumper come right off you can just

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.580 
bumper come right off you can just
disconnect<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.780> fog<00:02:55.780> lamps<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.230> if<00:02:56.350> yours

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
disconnect the fog lamps and if yours

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.870 
disconnect the fog lamps and if yours
has<00:02:56.770> four<00:02:56.980> grams<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.310> don't<00:02:57.430> know<00:02:57.490> follow<00:02:57.700> them

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
has four grams I don't know follow them

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.949 
has four grams I don't know follow them
album<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.430> you'll<00:03:00.430> basically<00:03:00.610> end<00:03:01.030> up<00:03:01.150> with

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
album and you'll basically end up with

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.150 
album and you'll basically end up with
you<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.260> two<00:03:02.410> headlights<00:03:02.740> on<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:08.160> once

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
you know two headlights on there once

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.310 
you know two headlights on there once
you<00:03:09.280> get<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.580> done<00:03:11.130> there<00:03:12.130> will<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:13.320> this

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
you get that done there will be this

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.650 
you get that done there will be this
deal<00:03:14.709> here<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.610> bolted<00:03:19.209> there's<00:03:19.420> two

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
deal here that is bolted there's two

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.449 
deal here that is bolted there's two
there's<00:03:20.050> two<00:03:20.110> thirty<00:03:21.040> screws<00:03:21.610> here<00:03:21.959> one<00:03:23.459> right

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
there's two thirty screws here one right

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.740 
there's two thirty screws here one right
here<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.820> don't<00:03:24.880> know<00:03:25.060> if<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.239> can<00:03:25.390> see

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
here and I don't know if you can see

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.240 
here and I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.290> facing<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.739> opposite<00:03:27.040> way<00:03:27.100> so

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
that but it's facing the opposite way so

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.090 
that but it's facing the opposite way so
the<00:03:27.489> screw<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.570> other<00:03:28.780> side<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.070> you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
the screw is on the other side so you

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.380 
the screw is on the other side so you
have<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.400> push<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:31.110> even<00:03:32.110> more<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:33.390> and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
have to push this down even more and and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.490 
have to push this down even more and and
it's<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.769> get<00:03:35.920> your<00:03:36.100> uh<00:03:37.050> what<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.080> used

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
it's you have to get your uh what I used

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's you have to get your uh what I used
was<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.660> wasn't<00:03:40.660> able<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.220> didn't<00:03:42.220> have

was this I wasn't able to I didn't have

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.180 
was this I wasn't able to I didn't have
a<00:03:42.370> actual<00:03:43.180> Torx<00:03:43.540> bit<00:03:43.750> small<00:03:44.590> enough<00:03:44.800> so<00:03:45.010> this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
a actual Torx bit small enough so this

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.190 
a actual Torx bit small enough so this
is<00:03:45.310> all<00:03:45.430> I'll<00:03:45.550> use<00:03:45.760> there<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.180> was<00:03:47.019> able<00:03:47.170> to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
this small assembly oh come on I did it

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.890 
this small assembly oh come on I did it
I<00:03:53.530> didn't<00:03:53.800> know<00:03:53.860> at<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.160> beginning<00:03:54.750> because<00:03:55.750> I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
I didn't know at the beginning because I

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.400 
I didn't know at the beginning because I
was<00:03:55.989> trying<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.170> take<00:03:56.320> off<00:03:58.019> there<00:03:59.019> was<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.140> screw

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
right here that holds a headlight to

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.130 
right here that holds a headlight to
this<00:04:00.959> bracket<00:04:01.959> and<00:04:02.140> there's<00:04:03.010> another<00:04:03.280> one

that there's another one that holds the
headlight<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.610> this<00:04:12.910> bracket

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.469 

that's<00:04:17.549> down<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.949> and<00:04:19.949> it's<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.150> waited

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
that's down here and it's the one waited

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.960 
that's down here and it's the one waited
for<00:04:22.079> me<00:04:22.199> to<00:04:22.379> reach<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.740> was<00:04:22.949> that<00:04:23.129> you<00:04:23.939> know

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
for me to reach it was that you know

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.529 
for me to reach it was that you know
remove<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.509> headlight<00:04:24.659> with<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:26.389> with<00:04:27.389> this

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
remove the headlight with this with this

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.110 
remove the headlight with this with this
a<00:04:27.569> bracket<00:04:28.379> here<00:04:28.409> actually<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.639> know<00:04:29.759> turn<00:04:30.000> it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
a bracket here actually you know turn it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.240 
a bracket here actually you know turn it
sideways<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.900> not<00:04:31.500> for<00:04:31.650> me<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.860> reach<00:04:32.039> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
sideways and not for me to reach it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.580 
sideways and not for me to reach it
because<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.599> screwed<00:04:33.599> was<00:04:33.750> facing<00:04:34.139> inwards

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
because the screwed was facing inwards

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.580 
because the screwed was facing inwards
towards<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.009> car<00:04:35.250> towards<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.699> radiator<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
towards the car towards the radiator and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.219 
towards the car towards the radiator and
once<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.710> did<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.219> just<00:04:38.250> connected<00:04:38.969> the<00:04:39.229> the

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
once I did that I just connected the the

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.209 
once I did that I just connected the the
bit<00:04:40.650> connector<00:04:41.069> and<00:04:42.319> when<00:04:43.319> I<00:04:43.349> came<00:04:43.830> right<00:04:43.979> up<00:04:44.009> I

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
bit connector and when I came right up I

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.649 
bit connector and when I came right up I
just<00:04:44.400> came<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.580> as<00:04:44.759> in<00:04:44.909> an<00:04:45.030> assembly<00:04:45.210> but<00:04:45.479> just

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
just came in as in an assembly but just

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.420 
just came in as in an assembly but just
like<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:47.659> and<00:04:48.659> I<00:04:49.590> am<00:04:49.650> NOT<00:04:50.009> going<00:04:50.219> to<00:04:50.250> take

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
like this and I am NOT going to take

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.879 
like this and I am NOT going to take
that<00:04:50.639> out<00:04:50.819> because<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.539> did<00:04:51.780> was<00:04:52.139> use<00:04:52.860> a

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
that out because all I did was use a

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.420 
that out because all I did was use a
little<00:04:53.219> bit<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.400> aluminum<00:04:53.849> foil<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.430> folded

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
little bit of aluminum foil and folded

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.209 
little bit of aluminum foil and folded
it<00:04:56.520> together<00:04:56.819> and<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.830> placed<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.949> on<00:04:59.009> top<00:04:59.069> of

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
it together and just placed it on top of

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.920 
it together and just placed it on top of
the<00:04:59.370> terminal<00:04:59.729> I<00:04:59.789> was<00:04:59.909> too<00:05:00.030> far<00:05:00.180> away<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.449> and

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
the terminal I was too far away and and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.209 
the terminal I was too far away and and
it<00:05:01.139> it<00:05:01.830> worked<00:05:02.069> and<00:05:02.610> I'm<00:05:03.389> surprised<00:05:03.840> that<00:05:04.219> but

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
it it worked and I'm surprised that but

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.189 
it it worked and I'm surprised that but
it<00:05:05.340> did<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.759> didn't<00:05:06.750> think<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:06.960> was<00:05:07.020> gonna<00:05:07.139> be

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
it did I didn't think it was gonna be

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.570 
it did I didn't think it was gonna be
that<00:05:07.289> easy

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.209 

but<00:05:11.580> yeah<00:05:12.419> it's<00:05:12.629> it's<00:05:13.050> not<00:05:13.289> that<00:05:13.349> difficult<00:05:13.860> to

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
but yeah it's it's not that difficult to

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.279 
but yeah it's it's not that difficult to
take<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.639> off<00:05:14.789> so<00:05:15.539> if<00:05:15.689> you<00:05:15.810> want<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.080> save<00:05:16.259> some

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
take it off so if you want to save some

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.469 
take it off so if you want to save some
money<00:05:16.529> or<00:05:16.889> even<00:05:16.919> maybe<00:05:17.729> you<00:05:17.969> got<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.270> same

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
money or even maybe you got that same

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.059 
money or even maybe you got that same
problem<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:19.020> fixed<00:05:19.379> it<00:05:19.500> with<00:05:21.529> what<00:05:22.529> a<00:05:22.560> penny<00:05:22.889> or

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
problem I fixed it with what a penny or

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.010 
problem I fixed it with what a penny or
two<00:05:23.099> of<00:05:23.610> aluminum<00:05:24.599> foil

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
two of aluminum foil

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.629 
two of aluminum foil
it<00:05:25.169> wasn't<00:05:25.440> even<00:05:25.529> it<00:05:25.770> was<00:05:25.889> about<00:05:26.069> a<00:05:26.129> square

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
it wasn't even it was about a square

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.269 
it wasn't even it was about a square
inch<00:05:26.909> of<00:05:27.300> aluminum<00:05:28.259> foil<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.740> just<00:05:28.949> folded

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
inch of aluminum foil that I just folded

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.980 
inch of aluminum foil that I just folded
into<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.550> small<00:05:29.849> square<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:31.560> worked<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.990> I'm

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
into a small square and it worked so I'm

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.529
