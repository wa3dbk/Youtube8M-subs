00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.320
 you can make a more similar cut 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.110
 with that player is the following or Miguel 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 veloso he has a hair under kant alone 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.489
 which give you some personal touches 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.809
 it cuts the short hair p in the part of 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 behind and let the fringe see the secret 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.460
 of any hairstyle taught here and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 of any man you have asked for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 here is always cut shorter in part 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.869
 from behind and left and the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 evidence was shorter than hair 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.180
 always leave a little bump because 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.159
 This will leave your hairstyle beyond 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.640
 of the most versatile modern you can go 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.830
 making hair stuck there 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.409
 Make Hair Messy And How Do You 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.869
 You can make those hairstyles that I 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 I taught here using many ointments 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 the difference between the scene and the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.479
 ointment ointment you can model 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 another hair now will you 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.409
 can either be deferred wire or not 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.060
 so cool to use to model the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.009
 because to model the hair or 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.780
 whether you're going to use a lot of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.240
 majority of Brazilian men due to 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.600
 our climate is has a hair is 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 tends to be oily so use a 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 ointment and gentle attachment when you 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 not want to model all the more so is to take a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.020
 volume average fixation strong 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.990
 when you go there and do a hairstyle 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.240
 like this if you do not have a region 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.850
 of fastening 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.540
 you can use an ointment 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.040
 softening and in the end there is playing a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.810
 hair spray 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.780
 So how did I tell you the hair? 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.760
 his is an attacker is here in case I 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.590
 I scraped one here because I like that my 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.349
 hair grows with volume so it's something 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.500
 which is a personal touch and you speak to 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.690
 same thing my hair then he is out 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.300
 miguel fleecy hair volume is 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.130
 in being messy in the back and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.709
 still have a tuft so I'll spend a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.540
 little bit of ointment 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.670
 another question you always ask 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.410
 alex has tutorial because you spend 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 ointment before the total you spend 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.290
 the average hair when 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.900
 brushing a Japanese conduit 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.450
 with precision I already use the ointment to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 do not need to model after not 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.440
 It's just like short hair that I go 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.660
 Then I'll use the ointment more 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.880
 sleeps here to get easier and gives 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.660
 a volume in my hair because it is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.110
 short and said he is without volume and a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.090
 hair on which is medium you will not 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.859
 stay model after confirmed that he 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.239
 will look that dirty and 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.540
 Let's know I do not know if it's a 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.980
 very cool word to be used then 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.799
 before it's taken in my long 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.820
 you will then spread a little 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:31.459
 ointment that just so you have a volume 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:34.519
 more in the hair so his hair is a 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.160
 merchant and about here to 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.040
 area in the division I have done so far from my 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.579
 entrance to get something cool 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.280
 then you come talk a little bit only 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.630
 a little bit even in this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.120
 moment and voice of drying house you do not 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.340

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.540
 next throw your hair forward already 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.609
 that he is short and his hair was iso 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.500
 throw your hair forward and let 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.440
 dry naturally and you will make a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.480
 The step that I will do after I want to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.480
 the tool of my hair 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.130
 Remembering there you have a dryer you 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.750

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.030

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.970
 that you are already giving a volume in the 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.250

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.870

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.729
 hairdryer is not good looking 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.430
 because of the cut so it does not have much 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.759
 Secret the secret is now coming with the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.590
 ointment you will now model the 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.229
