00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
to start with the basic structure and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.310 
to start with the basic structure and
get<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> feel<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> feel<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
get the feel for it get the feel for

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530

for<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.750> sake<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.200> lesson<00:03:37.440> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
for the sake of this lesson it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.370 
for the sake of this lesson it
represents<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.340> strum<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.660> if<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.080> for

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
represents a strum so if you have for

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.800 
represents a strum so if you have for
petes<00:03:40.680> per<00:03:40.890> measure<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.400> you've<00:03:41.820> got<00:03:42.000> 12<00:03:42.450> bars

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
petes per measure and you've got 12 bars

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.190 
petes per measure and you've got 12 bars
so<00:03:43.470> you've<00:03:43.709> got<00:03:43.739> another<00:03:44.250> 12<00:03:44.550> times<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.200> you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so you've got another 12 times for you

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.690 
so you've got another 12 times for you
can<00:03:46.350> have<00:03:46.500> 48<00:03:46.920> strums<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> get<00:03:47.489> through<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
can have 48 strums to get through the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.460 
can have 48 strums to get through the
whole<00:03:47.820> thing<00:03:47.850> I'll<00:03:48.269> play<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.200> once

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
whole thing I'll play it for you once

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.920 
whole thing I'll play it for you once
through<00:03:49.920> I'll<00:03:50.160> play<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:50.970> in<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.180> key<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.660> and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
through I'll play it in the key of a and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.180 
through I'll play it in the key of a and
you'll<00:03:52.170> see<00:03:52.380> we're<00:03:52.620> going<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.769> use<00:03:52.920> those

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
you'll see we're going to use those

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:02.449 
you'll see we're going to use those
three<00:03:53.519> chords<00:03:53.970> only<00:03:54.360> one<00:03:55.140> two<00:03:55.709> three<00:04:01.459> third

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
three chords only one two three third

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:12.140 
three chords only one two three third
bar<00:04:04.280> arm<00:04:05.280> still<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.000> 70<00:04:06.540> 187<00:04:09.620> divorce<00:04:11.150> might

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
bar arm still in a 70 187 divorce might

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:49.510 
bar arm still in a 70 187 divorce might
be<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.450> semi

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.880 

so<00:04:50.520> anyway<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.660> can<00:04:51.930> see<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.560> there's<00:04:52.830> a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
so anyway you can see that there's a

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.260 
so anyway you can see that there's a
structure<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.550> played<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:53.820> through<00:04:53.970> twice

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
structure I just played it through twice

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.150 
structure I just played it through twice
and<00:04:54.900> what<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.170> want<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.380> do<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.620> learn<00:04:55.890> that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
and what you want to do is learn that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.310 
and what you want to do is learn that
structure<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:56.760> get<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.060> down<00:04:57.240> later<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
structure and get it down later on you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.870 
structure and get it down later on you
can<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.590> crazy<00:04:58.890> with<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:05.190> can<00:05:05.370> get<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.640> later

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
can go crazy with you can get that later

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.970 
can go crazy with you can get that later
the<00:05:06.570> most<00:05:06.720> important<00:05:07.140> thing<00:05:07.170> it<00:05:07.620> doesn't<00:05:07.890> help

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
the most important thing it doesn't help

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.900 
the most important thing it doesn't help
to<00:05:08.070> learn<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.520> if<00:05:08.640> you<00:05:08.730> haven't

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
to learn that if you haven't

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.580 
to learn that if you haven't
internalized<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.690> structure<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.290> get<00:05:10.440> the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
internalized the structure to get the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:43.620 
internalized the structure to get the
feel<00:05:10.830> for<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:22.230> next<00:05:22.950> chord

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.810 

so<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.650> get<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.890> point<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.310> played<00:05:45.640> it<00:05:45.760> a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
so you get the point I played it a

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.890 
so you get the point I played it a
little<00:05:45.910> bit<00:05:46.090> hyper<00:05:46.240> with<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.480> little<00:05:46.660> bit<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.780> a

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
little bit hyper with a little bit of a

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.020 
little bit hyper with a little bit of a
vamp<00:05:47.080> there<00:05:47.350> but<00:05:47.980> you<00:05:48.400> can<00:05:48.610> learn<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.850> vamp

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
vamp there but you can learn the vamp

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.970 
vamp there but you can learn the vamp
later<00:05:49.300> poor<00:05:49.960> thing<00:05:50.170> is<00:05:50.200> internalized<00:05:50.830> the

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
later poor thing is internalized the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.430 
later poor thing is internalized the
structure<00:05:51.430> for<00:05:52.300> bars<00:05:52.570> of<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.840> first<00:05:53.140> chord
