 download it to your computer 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.019

 Hello everyone, I would travel and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.730
 today i will tell you about two cameras 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.240
 which are located in two smartphones 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 almost si van 8 and samsung galaxy s5 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 of course the first candidate will be 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 galaxy s5 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.800
 in this case you can observe 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.460
 video that i'm filming on galaxy 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 Pyaterochka as she looks like she 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 what color rendering is stabilized all 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.300
 These are the nuances I can say that pleases 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.110
 what the camera can shoot in 4k mode 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.399
 and glad that I shoot in mode 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.050
 sloumo about this we'll talk a little later 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.050
 I shoot video in dual mode 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.180
 he galaxy s5 example 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.180
 or tram killed 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.950
 I also want to draw attention to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.300
 photos that are made on galaxy s5 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 it is daytime solar time without hdr mode 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.540
 in this case, used hdr mode 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.990
 completely different photo 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.950
 Well, of course, another set of photos 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.970
 what can be done on galaxy s5 pleases 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.900
 juicy snapshots happy saturation 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.470
 colors 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.830
 happy that at night also 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.770
 convenient to take pictures and flash too 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.310
 very good light at all without 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.440
 flash noises and this is the same photo 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.729
 only with flash in my general 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.410
 chic in this case we see 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.070
 opportunity 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:04.250
 lapse video capture is 60 frames 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.970
 second and in this case it's 120 frames 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.390
 per second slow motion video i think that 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.420
 this is a great opportunity to shoot video in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.420
 slow motion also in the rain 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.530
 waterproof smartphone now 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.120
 I have a super opportunity 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.989
 it's stocked up 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.989
 I do not want to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:52.450
 seems to be swimming and videotaping 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:52.450
 hi and already the whole brain card to turn 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.549
 little girl 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.200
 also interesting feature is post 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.959
 focus when after committing 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.600
 snapshot you can choose that focus 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:12.100
 which you need and accordingly 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.250
 save it the way you want also 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:22.600
 the ability to shoot panoramas in huge 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:26.020
 resolution 19 1928 at 1616 hello everyone 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.950
 I shoot a video on the main extra 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.030
 the camera 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.120
 yachty sevan m8 particular now you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.230
 can watch 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:43.900
 one of the central squares of the city 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:45.550
 nickname euro for respect and honor 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.850
 its one m8 also has the ability 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.120
 shoot in dual mode which galaxy s5 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.230
 Well, the quality of the picture is of course a little bit 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.080
 weaker than samsung galaxy s5 she 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.049
 a bit darkish as for me and not 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.370
 enough brightness and saturation that 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.840
 As for photos, they are also 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.640
 little dim you and without 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.440
 saturation but quite good too 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:22.950
 particular i can say that almost simon 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:26.410
 m8 more will show itself in night shooting and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.580
 mode without and wait for the app is which are by the way 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.639
 I showed myself not very well 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.639
 It seems to me that the light of the sun is very 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.750
 big here in low light is very 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.879
 low light 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.370
 still in very low light and also 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:47.550
 low light photography well 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.650
 the final will show you the lowest photo 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.219
 lighting of course the quality of the photo is not 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.860
 very high as for the post 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:59.159
 focusing then she sure is here 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.190
 works a little worse than doing cs5 in 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:05.159
 particular i don't know why but 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.319
 focus harder then processing 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:14.300
 too well, that's harder still examples of images 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.300
 on htc one m8 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.340
 now it's time for a denser 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.880
 comparisons in particular you see both 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.730
 pictures and personally I would vote for 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.170
 right as the saturation 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.990
 frames are impressive well, plus everything 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.870
 stabilize a little bit more at 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.620
 galaxy s5 rather than lie down the symbol m8 well in 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:51.330
 write as you write now on the pics 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:55.470
 these zion 8 and galaxy s5 now my 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:01.880
 dog on m8 and one more dog 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:05.550
 the same also herbal banzai 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.640
 bright example of victory galaxy s5 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.760
 and here of course there is also sevan im 8 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.370
 showed itself better than galaxy 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.160
 s5 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:23.010
 as for the fountain, it turns out for 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:27.180
 that m8 is less beautiful picture and remember 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:34.530
 hdr mode in m8 without hiv yar out of 5 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:37.070
 without hdr and now it will be m8 with hdr and now 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.740
 from 5 hdr 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:44.610
 in general, yes friends htc one m8 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.730
 and samsung galaxy s5 it was a comparison 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:51.210
 cameras directly specific shots 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:54.000
 under various conditions in the comments 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.690
 write what you think about the pictures 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.790
 on galaxy s5 most often at 8 and which ones 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.980
 more like the pictures thank you for
