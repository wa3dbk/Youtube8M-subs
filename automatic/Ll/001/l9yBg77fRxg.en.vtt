motorcycle<00:02:00.290> they<00:02:00.740> all<00:02:00.920> vary<00:02:01.189> slightly

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
motorcycle they all vary slightly

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.690 
motorcycle they all vary slightly
because<00:02:02.149> for<00:02:03.080> example<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.590> seat<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> Ducati

because for example the seat on a Ducati

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.770 
because for example the seat on a Ducati
1098<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:06.200> smaller<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.729> those<00:02:07.970> might<00:02:08.239> be<00:02:08.269> 7

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780
