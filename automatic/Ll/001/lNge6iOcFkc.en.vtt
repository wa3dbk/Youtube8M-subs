tape and the reason you need this kind
of<00:01:29.820> tape<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> because<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.720> stronger

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
of tape is because it's much stronger

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
of tape is because it's much stronger
and<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.250> has<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> plastic<00:01:33.030> II<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> feel

on<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> top<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
on the top and that's really good to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.800 
on the top and that's really good to
paint<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.759> cut<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> piece<00:01:39.509> and

and<00:02:55.380> there<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:55.890> it

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.209 

okay<00:02:59.599> so<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.810> quick<00:03:00.290> tip<00:03:00.499> that<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.739> want<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> give

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
okay so a quick tip that I want to give

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.459 
okay so a quick tip that I want to give
you<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.670> never<00:03:02.359> paint<00:03:02.659> your<00:03:02.810> nails<00:03:03.019> under

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
you is that never paint your nails under

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.220 
you is that never paint your nails under
a<00:03:03.499> fan<00:03:03.859> because<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.819> dries<00:03:05.180> much<00:03:05.689> quicker<00:03:05.989> that

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
a fan because it dries much quicker that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110 
a fan because it dries much quicker that
way<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.469> then<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.040> start<00:03:07.340> getting<00:03:07.489> blotchy

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
way so then you start getting blotchy

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.569 
way so then you start getting blotchy
kind<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.900> nail<00:03:09.109> polish<00:03:09.379> that<00:03:09.950> you're<00:03:10.219> applying

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
kind of nail polish that you're applying

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.479 
kind of nail polish that you're applying
and<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.749> just<00:03:11.989> doesn't<00:03:12.319> come<00:03:12.769> out<00:03:12.829> as<00:03:13.129> smooth

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and it just doesn't come out as smooth

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.369 
and it just doesn't come out as smooth
so<00:03:14.030> make<00:03:14.209> sure<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.420> stay<00:03:14.689> away<00:03:14.780> from<00:03:14.900> fans

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
so make sure you stay away from fans

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.660 
so make sure you stay away from fans
when<00:03:15.650> you're<00:03:15.769> painting<00:03:16.099> your<00:03:16.189> nails<00:03:16.370> and
