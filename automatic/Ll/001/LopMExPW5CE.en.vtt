00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good stable state is that you are 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 here email director and we are in a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.950
 new minecraft video and it's a video 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.420
 special and here to explain 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 Point 4 version 1.7 and will serve to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.880
 many many of you for the pvp in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 servers I had then we're going to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.939
 explain what it's about good at here and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.579
 well I have the four things for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.039
 build it is very, very easy so 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.859
 only one you are going to need is a rail 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.920
 this is normal is a pretty and a buy 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.750
 nothing more then how to do 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.519
 to use the buggy what it is about 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.789
 good first to explain how to do what 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.670
 first you will see from a hole of 2 x 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.280
 1 on the ground then you will put here but 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.469
 There they are, explained, you put one or the other 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.130
 here you will see this way break the 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.620
 on one side and stabilize 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.710
 the management does not choose a beautiful one and the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.960
 you put on it later that escobedo is worth it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 this is how in this phase you put us 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 here over there and then why 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.330
 this serves an incomprehensive wagon 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 so it will be very weird because it's good 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 very simple you see that as the chest is the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.430
 narrower point than normal then you see 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 in what takes with this case the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.740
 wagon against him right there the center 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 must work to make it better for and the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 scepter you have to give right click there 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.940
 here in the pop a right and appear is 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.830
 inside the trolley with squeeze is the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.290
 sixth left to get off the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.950
 this one you will see here in a new 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.950
 inside the chest 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.720
 but that does not matter to squeeze if the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.240
 color is not to offer this 5 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.700
 so you can see country inside the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.040
 chest and feel visual things if not 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.690
 we are inside then with a bow what 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.690
 what can you do is let's see there 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 i 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.200
 so imagine what comes by 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 In front, a wall like that is valid and graphite 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.790
 to make it nice for the tutorial 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.310
 but imagine here and Ecuador or some 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.370
 I want to kill or something good they do not serve 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.959
 I hope so much to do all this day but 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.240
 someone can use you if you want and 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.040
 well this as well I said before is 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.940
 simply for the pvp since it is very 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.010
 used on a server and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.010
 And where is 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 before 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.780
 of rich 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:49.600
 and if you can see outside 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.710
 the effect those we motivate them good 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.750
 you more than anything just to 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.320
 say it's not clear to him how it works 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:13.270
 this skip we aim and funk combi 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.270
 started to help skeleton 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.330
 and in this way you will kill everything 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.880
 those that are worth we kill inside where 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.770
 there is a skeleton good guys up 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.420
 here I will leave in tutorial is this worth 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.860
 it's very simple just jump and if 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.840
 shoot is for those who do not 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.830
 this never because nothing by practice 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.170
 right away and I do not want a good attack 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.870
 Well here I leave the tutorial I hope that you 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.940
 have loved it if you find a tutorial 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.000
 more for vp readers because you know 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.590
 that lately a little to the channel 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.920
 high would only upload something 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.150
 more adventures or I do not know good I hope 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.950
 that you liked again life 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.120
 favorite comfort and see you in the 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.120
