and first of all some changes that they

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.529 
and first of all some changes that they
made<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.900> SMGs<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.859> nerfed<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.580> MSMC<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
made the SMGs they nerfed the MSMC and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110 
made the SMGs they nerfed the MSMC and
the<00:00:30.630> PDW<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.830> they<00:00:32.219> buffed<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.790> bunch<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the PDW and then they buffed a bunch of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
the PDW and then they buffed a bunch of
the<00:00:33.239> assault<00:00:33.570> rifles<00:00:34.020> minus<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.340> select<00:00:35.820> fire

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the assault rifles minus the select fire

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910 
the assault rifles minus the select fire
attachment<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> semi-automatic

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
attachment which is the semi-automatic

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.340 
attachment which is the semi-automatic
assault<00:00:38.520> rifles<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.629> nerfed<00:00:39.870> those<00:00:40.110> two

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
assault rifles so they nerfed those two

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
assault rifles so they nerfed those two
and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:40.620> buffed<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.129> type<00:00:41.520> 25<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.780> scar<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and then buffed the type 25 the scar and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.010 
and then buffed the type 25 the scar and
the<00:00:43.379> SWAT<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.399> said<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.879> nerfed<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the SWAT and like I said they nerfed the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
the SWAT and like I said they nerfed the
SMGs<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.770> means<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.039> made<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> SMGs<00:00:47.789> worse

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
SMGs that means they made the SMGs worse

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
SMGs that means they made the SMGs worse
and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.629> made<00:00:48.870> three<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> assault<00:00:49.680> rifles

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and I made three of the assault rifles

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420 
and I made three of the assault rifles
better<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.910> what<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> means<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> me<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
better so what this means to me is that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770 
better so what this means to me is that
they're<00:00:53.699> trying<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.480> less

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
they're trying to make the game less

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.590 
they're trying to make the game less
fast-paced<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> SMGs<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.850> good<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
fast-paced because the SMGs are good for

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
fast-paced because the SMGs are good for
rushing<00:00:58.079> obviously<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.070> keep

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
rushing obviously but if you keep

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580 
rushing obviously but if you keep
nerfing<00:00:59.820> them<00:00:59.969> rushing<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> be

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
nerfing them rushing is not going to be

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.009 
nerfing them rushing is not going to be
as<00:01:01.800> effective<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:03.180> gonna<00:01:03.329> make<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> game

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

anything so I'm not saying it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060 
anything so I'm not saying it's
necessarily<00:01:53.970> easy<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.020> make<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.950> these

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
necessarily easy to just make all these

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.999 
necessarily easy to just make all these
changes<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.140> should<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.799> in

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
changes that we think we should see in

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.109 
changes that we think we should see in
the<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.590> don't<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.770> who<00:02:02.100> keep<00:02:02.939> their

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the game but I don't know who keep their

designing<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.409> I'm

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
designing the game for that's what I'm

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.160 
designing the game for that's what I'm
trying<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> figure<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.390> because<00:02:06.390> it's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
trying to figure out because it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.080 
trying to figure out because it's
clearly<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> general<00:02:08.729> majority

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
clearly not for the general majority
