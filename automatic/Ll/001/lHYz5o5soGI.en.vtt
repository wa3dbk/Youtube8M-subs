weight<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.820> canopy<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.509> fabric<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
weight of your canopy in fabric if you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.889 
weight of your canopy in fabric if you
are<00:01:56.009> using<00:01:56.189> something<00:01:56.579> heavier<00:01:57.149> weight<00:01:57.390> then

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
are using something heavier weight then

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.209 
are using something heavier weight then
I<00:01:57.990> would<00:01:58.140> suggest<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:59.040> bigger

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
I would suggest for you to get bigger

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.940 
I would suggest for you to get bigger
hooks<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> withhold<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.540> weight<00:02:00.689> if

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
hooks that can withhold the weight if

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.020 
hooks that can withhold the weight if
you<00:02:01.950> want<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> prevent<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.700> hooks<00:02:02.880> from

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you want to prevent your hooks from

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.730 
you want to prevent your hooks from
tearing<00:02:03.509> through<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.750> sheetrock<00:02:04.049> ceiling

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
all right so step four cut off the

all right so step four cut off the
excess<00:03:45.790> fabric<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.480> purchased<00:03:47.019> about<00:03:47.170> ten

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
excess fabric I purchased about ten

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.460 
excess fabric I purchased about ten
yards<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.159> fabric<00:03:48.610> and<00:03:48.730> end<00:03:49.540> up<00:03:49.780> only<00:03:49.989> using

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
yards in fabric and end up only using

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.130 
yards in fabric and end up only using
eight<00:03:50.650> yards<00:03:51.069> with<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:51.970> leftover<00:03:52.420> material<00:03:52.569> I

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
eight yards with the leftover material I

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.089 
eight yards with the leftover material I
think<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:53.560> will<00:03:53.709> make<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.920> curtain<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.549> it

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.029 

step<00:04:49.180> 6<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.569> decided<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.289> prime<00:04:50.710> and

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039

for<00:05:05.780> step<00:05:05.960> seven<00:05:06.320> I'm<00:05:06.470> going<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.800> cut<00:05:06.950> out<00:05:06.980> two

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
for step seven I'm going to cut out two

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.760 
for step seven I'm going to cut out two
sets<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.700> 30<00:05:07.940> inch<00:05:08.180> length<00:05:08.510> ribbons<00:05:09.050> this

sets of 30 inch length ribbons this

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.400 
sets of 30 inch length ribbons this
length<00:05:10.070> allows<00:05:10.430> me<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:10.940> suspend<00:05:11.360> my<00:05:11.510> rods<00:05:11.780> 15

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
length allows me to suspend my rods 15

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.710 
length allows me to suspend my rods 15
inches<00:05:12.680> from<00:05:12.890> my<00:05:13.070> ceiling<00:05:13.490> find<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.450> middle

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
inches from my ceiling find the middle

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.600 
inches from my ceiling find the middle
and<00:05:14.870> then<00:05:15.050> tie<00:05:15.380> them<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.710> each<00:05:15.890> ends<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
and then tie them to each ends of the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.210 
and then tie them to each ends of the
rod<00:05:16.790> in<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.270> simple<00:05:17.690> knot<00:05:17.870> then<00:05:18.560> tie<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:18.950> loose

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
ends together with a square knot like so

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.140 
ends together with a square knot like so
alright<00:05:24.230> so<00:05:24.470> now<00:05:24.650> we<00:05:24.710> are<00:05:24.860> onto<00:05:25.190> our<00:05:25.550> last<00:05:25.820> step

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
alright so now we are onto our last step

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.790 
alright so now we are onto our last step
and<00:05:26.420> that<00:05:26.720> is<00:05:26.930> step<00:05:27.200> 8

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
and that is step 8

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.180 
and that is step 8
hang<00:05:28.070> up<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.430> canopy<00:05:28.820> I'm<00:05:29.680> very<00:05:30.680> pleased<00:05:31.040> with

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
hang up the canopy I'm very pleased with

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
hang up the canopy I'm very pleased with
how<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.610> turned<00:05:31.940> out

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
how this turned out

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.180 
how this turned out
if<00:05:32.540> I<00:05:32.720> was<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:32.990> deuce<00:05:33.380> anything<00:05:33.770> differently

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
if I was to deuce anything differently

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.580 
if I was to deuce anything differently
then<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.880> would<00:05:35.090> probably<00:05:35.390> cut<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.230> dowels

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
then I would probably cut the dowels

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.860 
then I would probably cut the dowels
shorter<00:05:37.310> or<00:05:37.490> either<00:05:38.090> paint<00:05:38.420> them<00:05:38.630> silver

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
shorter or either paint them silver

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.260 
shorter or either paint them silver
other<00:05:39.620> than<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.010> I'm<00:05:40.250> still<00:05:40.550> very<00:05:40.730> happy

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
other than that I'm still very happy

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.510 
other than that I'm still very happy
with<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.600> way<00:05:41.690> this<00:05:41.870> turned<00:05:41.930> out<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.830> I<00:05:43.310> hope

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
with the way this turned out and I hope

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.860
