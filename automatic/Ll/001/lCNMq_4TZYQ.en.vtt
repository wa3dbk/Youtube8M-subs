all<00:00:35.960> right<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:36.110> think<00:00:36.470> we<00:00:36.680> learned<00:00:36.829> best<00:00:37.160> in<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
all right I think we learned best in the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.050 
all right I think we learned best in the
industry<00:00:37.460> when<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.239> asked<00:00:38.420> questions<00:00:38.899> yep<00:00:39.260> I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
industry when we asked questions yep I

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.310 
industry when we asked questions yep I
think<00:00:41.060> we've<00:00:41.360> all<00:00:41.450> had<00:00:41.480> experiences<00:00:41.690> where<00:00:42.230> we

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
think we've all had experiences where we

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.110 
think we've all had experiences where we
walk<00:00:42.530> up<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.800> people<00:00:42.830> on<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.220> floor<00:00:43.490> doing

that<00:00:49.400> way<00:00:49.520> but<00:00:49.580> if<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:49.820> show<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.960> member<00:00:51.260> and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
that way but if you show the member and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.410 
that way but if you show the member and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
will have that answer i continued by

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.460 
will have that answer i continued by
these<00:01:16.100> way<00:01:16.280> too<00:01:16.340> complex<00:01:17.890> but<00:01:19.240> but<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.270> think<00:01:20.690> as

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
these way too complex but but I think as

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.100 
these way too complex but but I think as
long<00:01:21.800> as<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.130> pursue<00:01:22.520> that<00:01:22.700> course<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.480> asking

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
long as you pursue that course of asking

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.020 
long as you pursue that course of asking
you<00:01:24.350> why<00:01:24.500> are<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.740> here<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.550> doing<00:01:25.880> good

you<00:04:13.690> can<00:04:13.840> fix<00:04:14.080> them<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.470> first<00:04:14.710> two<00:04:14.860> phases

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
you can fix them in the first two phases

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.729 
you can fix them in the first two phases
then<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.000> will<00:04:16.090> get<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.300> cascade<00:04:16.840> effect<00:04:16.870> than

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
then you will get a cascade effect than

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.130 
then you will get a cascade effect than

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
know you don't need to look at muscles

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.909 
know you don't need to look at muscles
you<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:31.759> to<00:04:31.850> look<00:04:32.000> at<00:04:32.090> muscles<00:04:32.919> hopefully

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
you need to look at muscles hopefully

anatomy<00:04:38.360> anatomy<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.410> lot<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.560> times

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
anatomy anatomy I think a lot of times

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.409 
anatomy anatomy I think a lot of times
we<00:04:39.919> get<00:04:40.070> caught<00:04:40.250> up<00:04:40.370> in<00:04:40.400> anatomy<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.210> again

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
we get caught up in anatomy and again

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.510 
we get caught up in anatomy and again
you<00:04:42.110> know<00:04:42.199> I<00:04:42.229> think<00:04:42.350> we<00:04:42.650> categorize<00:04:43.070> muscles

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
you know I think we categorize muscles

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.730 
you know I think we categorize muscles
so<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.639> we<00:04:43.820> can<00:04:44.000> quantify<00:04:44.150> results<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.650> you

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
so that we can quantify results but you

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.800 
so that we can quantify results but you
still<00:04:45.949> need<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.130> know<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.310> net<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:47.419> they

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
still need to know a net so that they

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.909 
still need to know a net so that they
said<00:04:48.520> what<00:04:49.520> muscles<00:04:49.880> are<00:04:50.000> involved<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.330> squad

are going to pinpoint one area of the

body that is often neglected and that is

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.920 
body that is often neglected and that is
the<00:05:34.430> origin<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.000> movement<00:05:35.330> when<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.510> look<00:05:35.750> at

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
the origin of movement when you look at

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.200 
the origin of movement when you look at
when<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.349> start<00:05:36.590> looking<00:05:36.620> at<00:05:36.889> movement<00:05:37.400> you

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
when you start looking at movement you

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.029 
when you start looking at movement you
stop<00:05:38.570> really<00:05:39.139> looking<00:05:39.440> at<00:05:39.500> muscles<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:39.979> you

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
stop really looking at muscles and you

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.460 
stop really looking at muscles and you
start<00:05:40.340> seeing<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:41.270> body<00:05:41.479> globally<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.199> start

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
start seeing the body globally you start

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.839 
start seeing the body globally you start
watching<00:05:42.590> my<00:05:42.860> move<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.159> then<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.550> start

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
watching my move and then you start

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.689 
watching my move and then you start
seeing<00:05:44.110> where<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.620> origin<00:05:46.099> of<00:05:46.159> movement<00:05:46.580> is

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
seeing where the origin of movement is

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.730 
seeing where the origin of movement is
and<00:05:46.880> in<00:05:46.970> most<00:05:47.120> complex<00:05:47.630> movement<00:05:48.110> it's<00:05:48.409> at<00:05:48.620> the

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
and in most complex movement it's at the

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.080 
and in most complex movement it's at the
