00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
right today I'm gonna start making a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.270 
right today I'm gonna start making a
little<00:01:03.359> uh<00:01:05.000> I<00:01:06.000> guess<00:01:06.540> crossmembers<00:01:07.350> little

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
little uh I guess crossmembers little

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.330 
little uh I guess crossmembers little
beams<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.820> across<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.340> central

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
beams to go across here for a central

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
beams to go across here for a central
support<00:01:12.439> for<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.780> big<00:01:15.780> sheet<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> wood<00:01:16.439> then

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
support for the big sheet of wood then

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
support for the big sheet of wood then
I'm<00:01:16.710> gonna<00:01:16.830> put<00:01:17.189> over<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.860> what<00:01:22.860> I'm

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I'm gonna put over this so what I'm

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
I'm gonna put over this so what I'm
gonna<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:26.240> find<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> actual

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
gonna do is find out what the actual

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.819 
gonna do is find out what the actual
like<00:01:29.030> inside<00:01:30.320> width<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:33.560> cut<00:01:34.560> those

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
like inside width is and cut those

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
like inside width is and cut those
boards<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.369> lengthen<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.780> gonna

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
boards to lengthen and I think I'm gonna

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.420 
boards to lengthen and I think I'm gonna
do<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:39.860> two<00:01:41.659> three

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
do one two three

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.600 
do one two three
so<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.700> looks<00:01:44.880> sad<00:01:45.439> looks<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:47.159> feet

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
so it looks sad looks like at two feet

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200 
so it looks sad looks like at two feet
distance<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:50.970> feet<00:01:51.299> between<00:01:52.729> each<00:01:53.729> board

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
distance of two feet between each board

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
distance of two feet between each board
so<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.930> starting<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> very

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
so it would be starting from the very

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.080 
so it would be starting from the very
end<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.719> board<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.579> got<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> two<00:01:59.850> feet

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
end of this board here got a two feet

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.480 
end of this board here got a two feet
here<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.290> board<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.250> from

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
here that's one board and then from

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.420 
here that's one board and then from
there<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:04.049> another<00:02:04.259> two<00:02:04.500> feet<00:02:04.710> that's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
there we go to another two feet that's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910 
there we go to another two feet that's
two<00:02:05.670> boards<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.409> then<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.469> go<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> our<00:02:07.799> last

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
two boards and then we go to our last

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.359 
two boards and then we go to our last
marking<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.729> has<00:02:08.849> three<00:02:09.060> boards

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
marking that has three boards

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.390 
marking that has three boards
so<00:02:10.519> now<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.729> need<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.209> make<00:02:11.739> three<00:02:12.739> boards<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.370> a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so now I need to make three boards at a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.710 
so now I need to make three boards at a
length<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:14.090> let's<00:02:14.900> see

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.630 

let's<00:02:20.260> call<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.830> about<00:02:20.980> 26<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> half<00:02:24.630> okay

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
let's call it about 26 and a half okay

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.920 
let's call it about 26 and a half okay
all<00:02:27.640> right<00:02:27.820> here<00:02:27.970> my<00:02:28.090> cuts<00:02:30.390> made<00:02:31.390> my<00:02:31.540> marking

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
all right here my cuts made my marking

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.380 
all right here my cuts made my marking
tree<00:02:32.140> aside<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.130> these<00:02:33.390> somewhat

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
tree aside so I can get these somewhat

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.580 
tree aside so I can get these somewhat
square<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.240> use<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.720> square<00:02:38.140> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
square and I use the square to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.810 
square and I use the square to
double-check<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.820> get

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
double-check that so I just have to get

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.030 
double-check that so I just have to get
them<00:02:45.910> positioned<00:02:46.380> make<00:02:47.380> sure<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> other<00:02:47.800> two

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
them positioned make sure the other two

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.690 
them positioned make sure the other two
pieces<00:02:48.400> fit<00:02:49.020> are<00:02:50.020> all<00:02:50.200> three<00:02:50.440> pieces<00:02:50.920> fit<00:02:51.340> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
pieces fit are all three pieces fit I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.100 
pieces fit are all three pieces fit I
know<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.690> them<00:02:52.810> does<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> want<00:02:56.050> to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
know one of them does and then I want to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.470 
know one of them does and then I want to
start<00:02:56.290> drilling<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.760> putting<00:02:58.360> screws<00:02:58.510> in

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
start drilling and putting screws in

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.300 
start drilling and putting screws in
this<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.660> looking<00:03:01.930> good<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.320> far<00:03:05.310> that's

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
I'm gonna do for the SATs here well we

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.150 
I'm gonna do for the SATs here well we
have<00:05:25.569> this<00:05:25.720> leftover<00:05:26.110> trim<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:29.110> they'll<00:05:29.949> give

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
have this leftover trim and they'll give

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.740 
have this leftover trim and they'll give
it<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.310> little<00:05:30.490> bit<00:05:30.669> of<00:05:30.759> a<00:05:30.819> little<00:05:31.419> bit<00:05:31.539> of<00:05:31.569> an

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
it a little bit of a little bit of an

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.260 
it a little bit of a little bit of an
overhang<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.479> think<00:05:35.970> that<00:05:36.970> would<00:05:37.090> look

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
overhang but I think that would look

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.439 
overhang but I think that would look
kind<00:05:37.449> of<00:05:37.509> corny<00:05:37.960> on<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.470> edges<00:05:41.819> yeah<00:05:42.819> I'm

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
kind of corny on the edges yeah I'm

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.110 
kind of corny on the edges yeah I'm
gonna<00:05:43.539> go<00:05:43.690> with<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:44.639> then<00:05:45.639> I<00:05:45.669> might<00:05:45.910> get<00:05:46.060> a

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
gonna go with that then I might get a
