00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 jojo youtube my name is cool and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.160
 Today I want you the premium 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.949
 features of battlefield hotline 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 there were many rumors what 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.390
 Everything is present in the premium package 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 a few days ago, information was placed 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 which now also from the official 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 website have been confirmed in my opinion 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.609
 After that there are really simply interesting 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009
 not doing things like battlefield 4 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.590
 premium where there are only the double xp events 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.870
 gave and you get all the dlcs for free 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 has in battlefield hotline there 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.520
 namely the four so-called super 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 features the first great feature is this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.190
 weapons lab there you can look that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.200
 change the weapon 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.640
 probably design your own camouflage 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.329
 or other details about the weapons 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.550
 change 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.500
 Furthermore, the kills for each 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.629
 weapon in game that is called it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.309
 maybe will give so stepic weapons 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 as with counter-strike global offensive 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 another great feature is that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.410
 match game 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 there will be ranked tournaments and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.339
 But leagues only give for themselves 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 Premium members whether it's extra 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.549
 Rankings for non-premium members 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.380
 is what I think 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.450
 feebleminded who is not yet known 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 another premium feature is the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 Legend status there will be possible 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.150
 be his entire game progress 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.520
 set to zero again and still 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.060
 to play once at maximum level 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 Weapon towers etc will reset and man 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.110
 I have to free everything from scratch again 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.930
 maybe you will receive a distinction now 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 special emblems skins or camouflage 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.009
 I think that sounds very much like that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 prestige levels in call of duty 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.310
 may be curious if battlefield that 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 similar or maybe very different 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.119
 translates the fourth and last super 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 feature are the masks maybe you have 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.299
 you already at other youtube on 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 Gameplay material seen where dinosaurs 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.170
 or wolf's masks show up like you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.119
 but this can unlock or 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.409
 whether they are selectable from the beginning 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.630
 is yet unknown 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 These masks are supposed to have gameplay preferences 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.119
 Offer the theme of each 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.590
 mask 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 how can I imagine that? 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.860
 if I have the dinosaur mask on 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.390
 I experience more when I get the wolfs 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.520
 I can run faster on my mask 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.990
 Well, we'll see, I just hope 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.680
 that the benefits you get through this 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.869
 masks 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.039
 not too big are further were 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.020
 already four digital ones 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.760
 expansion packages announced which 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.740
 new multiplayer cards new modes 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.140
 Vehicles and other content in the game 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
 involve the first dlc criminal 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.470
 Activity will be available from the summer of 2015 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 to be available 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.490
 Players need to be on high speed and 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.120
 individually destructible cards one 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.370
 make names 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.530
 the second dlc has the name robbery 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.820
 players challenge their opponents and 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.850
 fight through important scenes 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.220
 Full of cinema ralf action this dlc will 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.750
 Also available from the summer of 2015 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.250
 Of course, these details are only in the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.050
 a timeframe and no more accurate 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.780
 time I could well imagine 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.760
 that possibly casinos motels or 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 other cinematic scenes with 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.250
 be involved as third expected 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.670
 us the dlc package with the name get away 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.230
 breathtaking highspeed 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.900
 Chases of persecution deepen this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.250
 Bank raid I think yes gaming experience 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.540
 that sounds like an extension 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 for the already in the main game 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.330
 content mode means the last dlc the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.770
 was announced called bitrate traitor 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.390
 the players have to lurk everywhere 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.580
 find out who they can mourn 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.340
 well, if that becomes something like trouble and 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.959
 terrorists with better graphics 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.570
 determined very varied and 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.100
 could be funny like that and last 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.900
 Of course , there are also those 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.430
 zero eight fifteen premium benefits the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.799
