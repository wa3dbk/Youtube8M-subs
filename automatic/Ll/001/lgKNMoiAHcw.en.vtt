00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.719
 you are interested in a blood type diet 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 fine mean you understand what for 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 your body's good work is very 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 it is important to adjust 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 exactly proper nutrition because 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
 otherwise your body has the right to climb 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.630
 work inefficient well and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.179
 grow old prematurely 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 like any other system if you your 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.220
 favorite car instead of 98 petrol 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.440
 pour diz fuel or some water into 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.870
 gas tank I think that we are far from 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.840
 lucky and you can not even from the page 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.850
 if you have forged such a car is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 more your automaster will then explain to you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
 what is proper nutrition how much is it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
 worth it though at car level this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 pennies on average walls damage that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.390
 improper nutrition causes your 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.810
 own health 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.660
 I do not know the car which costs 5 6 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.070
 million dollars this is such an average 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.580
 cost of your own 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.140
 swarm truth at birth 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.330
 so I understand what is right 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 food i doctor nutritionist boris jump 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 I will help you understand this issue 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.100
 for starters, let's figure it out 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.759
 what is stupid blood type blood 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 This is a combination of 4 proteins which 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.640
 control your bloodstream 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.939
 blood vessels did not get someone else's blood 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.069
 case of mixing with and on large blood 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.229
 very likely evolis and you are exactly death 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.359
 so earlier blood transfusions are not yet 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.710
 knew blood types did not bring 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.999
 expected effect most cases 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.549
 learn to the system of proper nutrition 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:44.219
 blood type have about the same 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.909
 relation to the fifth wheel of the cart 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.429
 flying into space of course is different 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.560
 technological progress need to stage 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.240
 so many different 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.189
 you know the cart can be launched into space 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.929
 over time it is very expensive 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.880
 pleasure of meaning in this particular 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:06.029
 I see except pr so the power of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.940
 blood types 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:11.450
 carts into space he passed sew some 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 some people do it and she will leave 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.150
 why because she has no relationship 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.230
 more nutritional relationships 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.909
 other 20 squirrel 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.239
 systems which is in the circulatory 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.260
 mainstream and who are called upon to 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 control not let the cells 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.580
 pesticides and herbicides allergens other 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.549
 toxic substances that is, they protect 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.799
 your cell matter is that by these 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.060
 research systems each of them 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.400
 engaged in just a few 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.060
 researchers around the world they are known 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.019
 only a narrow circle of specialists and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.700
 tell you exactly with this 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.950
 Now this system is associated with and then 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.530
 the other is very difficult because you do this 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.480
 you don't know 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.819
 so I think it's not worth it 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 bother with your health and 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.140
 focus on blood type 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.670
 the more so if you eat in groups 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.270
 blood need to forget such a science as 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.080
 genetics 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.989
 6 married couple will be with husband and wife 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.870
 there will be first and fourth blood group 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.150
 not one child in common with them 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.459
 blood group will not be all joint 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.030
 children will have either a second or third 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.989
 blood type 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.360
 alas, but this is so if we recognize that the first 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.120
 blood type is a predator and the second is said 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.610
 the second blood type is vegan then 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.000
 by nature it turns out that a lion will give birth to a sheep 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.060
 but if you hear such a case you will learn 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.400
 let me know i will be very happy to see 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.080
 I ask this situation more 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.290
 I haven't heard that 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.940
 a blood group but it governs 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.460
 eat if you eat the genetics 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.130
 should be just forget you know 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.740
 who is the most important regulator in your 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.760
 food dictated by your body 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.160
 addictions this is your hypothalamus 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.980
 which should properly feed your 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.350
 brain brain consumes 20 percent blood 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.080
 and very dependent on blood 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.210
 there will be all the nutrients and as soon as 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.450
 something level of some component 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.340
 decreases your hypothalamus gives command and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.680
 do you remember your favorite products 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 power supply this situation is chosen here 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.610
 this food you love 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.850
 but this is not very because in love 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.140
 food product more more 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.360
 specific which is exactly your 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.100
 the brain 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.460
 so you love these foods 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.130
 the truth is partially the correction is not 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.100
 blood groups for a completely different 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.420
 digestive system because 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.480
 when favorite food 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.850
 invest in the food system 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.120
 If there is a problem in the oral cavity 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.100
 some lower astrida misery 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.419
 gall dyskinesia pancreatitis 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.470
 cholelithiasis 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.530
 that is, the digestive system that is broken 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.950
 favorite food 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.890
 digestive 7 digested 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.040
 defective some components are asking 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.370
 some are rotting and not fully in the blood 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.669
 get in and here's a very important one 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.570
 nutritional system moment 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.230
 making the digestive system work 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.560
 ok so this is not us again 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.540
 blood types are held for jurisdiction 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.910
 Gastroenterologist or doctor 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.460
 a physiotherapist who can work out 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.460
 this system improve your work 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.780
 digestive and then your favorite 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.250
 the product will also start to full 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.680
 digest there is another regulator in 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.130
 this process is censor he is very 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.800
 blood from the fact that it is not desirable 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.289
 you food products 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.620
 rotting fermentation products and trying not 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.289
 letting their brain work it's food is liver 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.539
 the main filter your body cleans 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.820
 blood from all this chemistry toxic 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.650
 substances and trying to fill and beneficial 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.810
 substances properties only you need 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.780
 not only you 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.539
 if the oven works well your brain 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.580
 works well if liver work 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.650
 breaking there some kind of phenomenon 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.860
 chronic hepatitis eat adipose 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.719
 hepatosis you and then hepatitis 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:27.150
 and the first stages are stone disease not 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.280
 will the oven work efficiently and not 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.479
 will fully supply your brain 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.689
 Muses components 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.030
 so here on this level or live something 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.300
 proper nutrition that is when you 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.139
 established the work of the digestive liver 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.599
 food roll over 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.110
 high-grade brain gets high-grade 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.030
 nutrition 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.430
 as well as all the cells get good 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.039
 You have been in the health zone for years 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.279
 if you have not provided this system 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:56.219
 full food is not digested as 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.060
 necessary cells do not get useful 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.099
 nutrients 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.400
 you find yourself in the unhealthy zone 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:05.099
 diseases if you want to get out of disease 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.620
 get into health contacts you see 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:10.139
 contact we will fix your thousand 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.759
 liver alarm system and provide your 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.680
 brain and at the same time every cell of your 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.990
 the body's theme with beneficial nutrients 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.039
 substances that are in the usual 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.039
 you food
