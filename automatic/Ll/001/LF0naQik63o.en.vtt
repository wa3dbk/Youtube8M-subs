this<00:03:04.610> also<00:03:04.819> works<00:03:05.090> when<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.420> tank<00:03:05.689> is<00:03:05.780> moving

how bowie accomplishments can be hard to

how bowie accomplishments can be hard to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
determine when smoke is deployed and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.290 
determine when smoke is deployed and
anime<00:03:39.950> fire<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.400> coming<00:03:40.730> from<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.880> opposite

example<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:45.140> quite<00:03:45.440> obvious<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.070> tank

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
example is quite obvious that the tank

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.130 
example is quite obvious that the tank
is<00:03:46.400> backing<00:03:46.580> up<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.390> we<00:03:47.480> assume<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:48.050> the
