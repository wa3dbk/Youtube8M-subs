to mess around with it and then I'll do

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.140 
to mess around with it and then I'll do
it<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.860> actually<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.340> show<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it then actually we can show what that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.679 
it then actually we can show what that
looks<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.360> anyway<00:01:15.920> family<00:01:16.920> options<00:01:17.689> the

looks like anyway family options the
same<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> same<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.070> steam<00:01:20.450> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
same that's all the same as steam it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
same that's all the same as steam it
detects<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> fact<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> steam

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

controller you've got your time zones
your<00:01:25.140> system<00:01:25.500> stuff<00:01:25.710> I've<00:01:26.189> got<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:27.030> gtx<00:01:27.869> 780<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
your system stuff I've got a gtx 780 I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.499 
your system stuff I've got a gtx 780 I
was<00:01:29.400> fortunate<00:01:29.579> enough<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> with

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
was fortunate enough to get that with

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
was fortunate enough to get that with
the<00:01:30.750> 16<00:01:31.500> gigs<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.920> ram<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> 3.2<00:01:34.400> i<00:01:35.400> 7<00:01:36.030> i'm

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
the 16 gigs of ram with the 3.2 i 7 i'm
guessing<00:01:37.729> we've<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.909> an<00:01:39.150> update<00:01:39.720> an<00:01:40.259> option

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guessing we've got an update an option

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.109 
guessing we've got an update an option
here<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> shows<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.000> your

here so that it shows you what your
steam<00:01:42.570> OS<00:01:42.720> update<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:43.979> check<00:01:44.490> for

steam OS update is and you can check for
steam<00:01:44.970> updates<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.530> also

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
steam updates I'm also you can also

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080

participate in the beta client and check

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
participate in the beta client and check
for<00:01:48.240> client<00:01:48.659> updates<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> does

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
for client updates so it does

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.039 
for client updates so it does
distinguish<00:01:50.640> between<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.149> client<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> the

steam<00:01:55.049> OS<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> let's<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:58.130> can<00:01:59.130> view<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
steam OS so let's see if we can view it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.259 
same as like an a B button on the 360
controller<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.340> while<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.790> took<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> few

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
controller and while that took a few

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.970 
controller and while that took a few
minutes<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.840> used<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.199> its<00:03:31.440> pretty<00:03:31.919> much

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
minutes to get used to its pretty much

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.550 
minutes to get used to its pretty much
become<00:03:32.940> standard<00:03:33.329> for<00:03:33.510> me<00:03:33.629> so<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.409> of<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
become standard for me so one of the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.839 
become standard for me so one of the
things<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.829> people<00:03:35.190> were<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.489> curious

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
things that people were really curious

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.670 
things that people were really curious
about<00:03:35.970> was<00:03:36.269> how<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.049> type<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> made<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
about was how do you type and I made a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.189 
about was how do you type and I made a
separate<00:03:38.159> video<00:03:38.310> about<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.569> figure<00:03:40.169> I

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
separate video about this but I figure I

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.289 
separate video about this but I figure I
should<00:03:40.319> show<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.680> guys<00:03:40.949> as<00:03:41.159> well<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.970> use

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
should show you guys as well so you use

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.800 
should show you guys as well so you use
the<00:03:42.479> left<00:03:42.840> stick<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.159> type<00:03:44.639> so<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.389> can<00:03:45.599> tie

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
the left stick to just type so I can tie

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.960

use the buttons on the back here to

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.500 
use the buttons on the back here to
change<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.800> cursor<00:04:23.070> selection<00:04:23.610> a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.900 

video<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:31.540> it's<00:04:32.540> as<00:04:32.990> fast<00:04:33.860> as<00:04:34.310> one<00:04:34.729> could

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
video and it's as fast as one could

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.060 
video and it's as fast as one could
expect<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.270> type<00:04:35.449> on<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> controller<00:04:36.070> which

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
expect to type on a controller which

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.280 
expect to type on a controller which
says<00:04:37.790> not<00:04:38.180> too<00:04:38.360> much<00:04:38.479> but<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.919> works<00:04:40.160> so

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
says not too much but it works so

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.510 
says not too much but it works so
between<00:04:42.290> all<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.680> then<00:04:42.949> you've<00:04:43.100> also<00:04:43.220> got

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
between all that then you've also got

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.610 
between all that then you've also got
the<00:04:43.729> web<00:04:44.270> browser<00:04:44.540> which<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.410> same<00:04:45.560> as

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
the web browser which is the same as

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.950 
the web browser which is the same as
usual<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.370> can<00:04:46.400> zoom<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:49.270> close<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.870> do

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
usual you can zoom in and close and do

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.870

then zoom in and out I can go through

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.580 
then zoom in and out I can go through
previous<00:05:02.180> tabs<00:05:02.539> next<00:05:02.930> tabs<00:05:03.110> with<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:03.440> right

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
previous tabs next tabs with the right

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.680 
previous tabs next tabs with the right

triggers and I can move through

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.930 
triggers and I can move through
everything<00:05:05.990> with<00:05:06.440> between<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.430> three<00:05:07.699> main

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
everything with between the three main

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.620 
everything with between the three main
sections<00:05:08.210> with<00:05:08.930> these<00:05:09.080> back<00:05:09.320> buttons<00:05:09.710> and

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
sections with these back buttons and

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.090 
sections with these back buttons and
with<00:05:11.630> all<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:13.539> am<00:05:14.539> able<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:15.139> basically

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
with all of that I am able to basically

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.430 
with all of that I am able to basically
navigate<00:05:16.699> through<00:05:16.850> everything<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:17.900> can

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
navigate through everything so I can

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.230 
navigate through everything so I can
exit<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.130> then<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.280> can<00:05:19.669> return<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.120> the

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
exit and then I can return to the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.550 
exit and then I can return to the
desktop<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.900> this<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.199> one<00:05:21.289> thing<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.440> I

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
desktop and this is the one thing that I

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.620 
desktop and this is the one thing that I
have<00:05:21.710> not<00:05:21.830> seen<00:05:22.010> yet<00:05:22.160> so<00:05:22.699> you<00:05:22.760> guys<00:05:22.970> are<00:05:23.270> in<00:05:23.510> it

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
have not seen yet so you guys are in it

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.439 
have not seen yet so you guys are in it
with<00:05:23.810> me<00:05:23.840> but<00:05:24.220> we<00:05:25.220> are<00:05:25.250> essentially<00:05:25.729> turning

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
with me but we are essentially turning

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.730 
with me but we are essentially turning
into<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.870> linux<00:05:27.560> desktop<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.720> this<00:05:29.720> is<00:05:30.050> how<00:05:30.560> it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
into a linux desktop and this is how it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:38.379 
into a linux desktop and this is how it
looks<00:05:32.260> we<00:05:33.460> don't<00:05:34.460> have<00:05:36.250> too<00:05:37.250> much<00:05:37.460> in<00:05:37.880> here<00:05:38.210> but

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
looks we don't have too much in here but

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.120 
looks we don't have too much in here but
it<00:05:38.539> seems<00:05:38.750> like<00:05:38.870> we're<00:05:38.990> using<00:05:39.139> our<00:05:39.440> right

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
it seems like we're using our right

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.250 
it seems like we're using our right
stick<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.669> move<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.419> a<00:05:41.630> cursor<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:45.080> seems

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
stick to move in a cursor and it seems

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.550 
stick to move in a cursor and it seems
like<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.470> can't<00:05:45.710> click<00:05:46.070> on<00:05:46.220> anything<00:05:46.870> um<00:05:47.870> or<00:05:48.410> at

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
like I can't click on anything um or at

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.540 
like I can't click on anything um or at
least<00:05:48.620> I<00:05:48.770> don't<00:05:48.919> know<00:05:48.979> how<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.190> oh<00:05:51.460> there<00:05:52.460> we<00:05:52.520> go

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
least I don't know how to oh there we go

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.600 
least I don't know how to oh there we go
so<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.210> can<00:05:53.270> click<00:05:53.539> on<00:05:53.570> things<00:05:54.280> with<00:05:55.280> my<00:05:55.430> right

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
so I can click on things with my right

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.890 
so I can click on things with my right
trigger<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:55.970> just<00:05:56.150> took<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.330> little<00:05:56.360> while<00:05:56.630> for
