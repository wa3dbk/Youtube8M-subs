come<00:04:15.340> back<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.730> achieve<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.449> my

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
come back and achieve it and my

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.979 
come back and achieve it and my
responsibility<00:04:18.340> is<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.549> add

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
responsibility is to add

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.640 
responsibility is to add
first<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.829> all<00:04:20.919> not<00:04:21.099> to<00:04:21.280> lose<00:04:21.459> players<00:04:21.940> and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
first of all not to lose players and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.890 
first of all not to lose players and
then<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.919> add<00:04:24.069> what<00:04:24.940> can<00:04:25.150> make<00:04:25.300> us<00:04:25.360> stronger

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
then to add what can make us stronger

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.510 
then to add what can make us stronger
because<00:04:26.259> when<00:04:26.500> you're<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:26.919> close<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.370> were

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
because when you're so close you were

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.439 
because when you're so close you were
last<00:04:27.789> year<00:04:28.590> its<00:04:29.590> first<00:04:30.099> important<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.849> keep

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
last year its first important to keep

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.570 
last year its first important to keep
your<00:04:31.479> strengths<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.199> think<00:04:32.979> we<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.250> added

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
your strengths I think we have added

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.790 
your strengths I think we have added
already<00:04:34.090> Thomas<00:04:34.539> Long<00:04:34.750> Island<00:04:35.169> whom<00:04:35.319> we<00:04:35.620> can

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
already Thomas Long Island whom we can

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.089 
already Thomas Long Island whom we can
say<00:04:36.039> has<00:04:36.220> not<00:04:36.520> played<00:04:37.169> last<00:04:38.169> season<00:04:38.560> at<00:04:38.919> all

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
say has not played last season at all

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.930 
say has not played last season at all
and<00:04:40.500> let's<00:04:41.500> hope<00:04:41.590> we<00:04:41.889> can<00:04:42.099> bring<00:04:42.370> one<00:04:42.400> or<00:04:42.759> two

and let's hope we can bring one or two

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.439 
and let's hope we can bring one or two
more<00:04:43.500> editions<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.740> top<00:04:45.250> quality<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:46.150> seems<00:04:46.389> to
