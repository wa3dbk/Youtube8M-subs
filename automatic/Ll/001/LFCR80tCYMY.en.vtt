00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.370
 and then people who follow the channel do 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.290
 yourself 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:23.570
 I 'm here with brand baby stroller 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:26.270
 had a boy model or a boy brand 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.910
 model did not know if my 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.460
 nephew and we won as a gift 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.660
 I'm going to record this video to show how it is. 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.100
 that opens and closes this cart because 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.020
 until we learn how it was 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.320
 people had enough difficulty then 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.000
 I believe that this difficulty can 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.610
 the same as other people who have a 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.269
 car like that so I'll show you the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.900
 you how it closes and then how it is 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.460
 Open the cart to close 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.949
 first it has two locks here 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.960
 a lock here in a lock here 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.680
 Then we 'll have to get this lock. 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.930
 from here I lift her to release the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.650
 first crossing of the blow here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.580
 she let go she let go and now people 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.400
 this lever handle raises here where 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.490
 there is another lock of that is enough 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.200
 push the cart forward i go 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.270
 learn the camera on the tripod to show 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.950
 For you, how is it? 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.500
 I showed without the lock I could only 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.480
 As she goes up, she'll disarm this 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.160
 lever that disarmed another task 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.140
 what's behind 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.770
 if it does not disarm noted here 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.100
 hitting here you go up here 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.880
 you will be able to drop it just that 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.550
 teaches 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.210
 now it's enough you just push the cart 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.210
 forward 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.130
 this way 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.650
 the basket is closed when opening 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 it's just an inverse move but it has 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:15.500
 a lock that said there, or show 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:18.710
 For you the detail now the lock stays 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 here the show will jump out of the light 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.100
 we could see better stay here then 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.080
 You'll pull this lock here and 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.570
 Lift the cart and I'll put the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.590
 camera here in place again and show 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.720
 for you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.850
 the reverse movement of the car opening 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 in reverse movement 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:51.200
 here the car picks up the sheet of this 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.450
 to lock up the handle forgets 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 fabric here that sometimes holds here 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.300
 down and drop the veil so far only 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.250
 You have to catch it, just pull it up. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.570
 will open 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.130
 He opened it but it is not yet all 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.770
 fully open that lock that the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.750
 People dropped out here and this has to be tight. 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.750
 It is the work and we press on the foot 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.830
 I 'm going here so I'm going to stay open here. 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.590
 so to recap this lock here 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.690
 is the lock that locks the car when it is 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.790
 Open 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.980
 This one is the one that locks the cart. 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.100
 when the cart 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.170
 in fact to this one of here is that 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.780
 lock the cart when cart closed 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.750
 and the other one that locks the cart when 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.060
 the cart is open when you say 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.880
 brave her here the particularity is you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.620
 slap and raise that lever 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.310
 here is an iron rod that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.750
 Behind it, too dark, you can not see a 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.360
 iron male behind what makes 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.400
 part of the lock there is only to fold the car 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.050
 forward 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.110
 so we're going to have to open with faith 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.540
 so that's it , the cart mounted on the 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.850
 beginning is a little difficult but after 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.010
 You learn it becomes easy if you 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.010
