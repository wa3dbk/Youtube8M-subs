00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
think this the door to the room is there

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.090 
think this the door to the room is there
and<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> bottom<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.450> close<00:02:31.720> by<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.890> makes

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and the bottom is close by so it makes

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.010 
and the bottom is close by so it makes
sense<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.580> me<00:02:33.730> for<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.300> put<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.570> compact

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
sense to me for you to put the compact

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.810 
sense to me for you to put the compact
and<00:02:35.200> close<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.680> door<00:02:35.920> when<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.490> baby's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and close the door when the baby's

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.660 
and close the door when the baby's
coming<00:02:36.970> through<00:02:37.390> our<00:02:37.870> new<00:02:38.020> bath<00:02:38.280> quickly<00:02:39.280> onto

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
coming through our new bath quickly onto

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.660 
coming through our new bath quickly onto
the<00:02:39.850> compact<00:02:40.270> interchange<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.830> then<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.520> think

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the compact interchange and then I think

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.900 
the compact interchange and then I think
this<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> wonderful<00:02:43.210> rule<00:02:43.810> for<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.320> crib<00:02:44.980> we

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
this is a wonderful rule for the crib we

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.280 
this is a wonderful rule for the crib we
wonderful<00:02:46.300> for<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.480> baby<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.840> lie<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
wonderful for the baby to lie in the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.110 
wonderful for the baby to lie in the
crib<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.800> look<00:02:48.220> up<00:02:48.310> at<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.580> Silla<00:02:48.790> stration

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
crib and look up at the Silla stration

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.990 
crib and look up at the Silla stration
so<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:49.960> think<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.830> makes<00:02:51.070> sense<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.460> me<00:02:51.610> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so I think that makes sense to me that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.190 
so I think that makes sense to me that
makes<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:54.450> whole<00:02:55.450> lotta<00:02:55.630> sense<00:02:55.660> great<00:02:55.960> stuff

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
