00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.950
 Deadly receive for left-handed side-turn service 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.129
 Players who are not good at left-handed 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:13.719
 Even if you are not left-handed, back serve or reverse rotation system 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.900
 Recommended for those who are not good at YG serve 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
 It becomes a receive method 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 When mastering this receive method 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
 The other party is puzzled 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
 I wonder why I would like to receive such a return 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.100
 It's a very hard to get 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.600
 I think I want people who are not good at serving in the reverse horizontal shape 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 The conclusion of what kind of receive this receive is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.030
 I left the rotation when I told you earlier 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 It is a stop receive and left the rotation 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 I would like to do stop reception 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.380
 Because this reception is still rotating 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 Your opponent will stop once more Double stop 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420
 Even if you try 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.750
 Because it bounces with a pin and comes out and floats from the stand 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.960
 The other party is hard to do double stop 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.990
 I can expect that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.229
 I can not double-stop after that 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.810
 Also against the other party to flick 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.659
 I'm bouncing a little because there is still rotation 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.450
 Because there is a little blur because it does not go straight up 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.420
 Even if you try to flick the position where the face hits 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.299
 You can get out of your way and make mistakes 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.310
 It is hard to do if it is a strange wonder 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.329
 It's like having a stop reception like this 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.570
 Become a receive with the image 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.400
 I would like to explain this way 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.570
 The first step is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 Just hold the racket vertically 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149
 It's a stop receive and it's like Tsutsuki 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.290
 I may want to go from below but 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.040
 Because I want to put it in the vertical, which is vertical 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.650
 Please make the racket vertical 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.180
 At this time the opposite side is bent 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.620
 It is easy to leave a turn when you get it back in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.200
 There is an image Next is the second step 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 The second step is that the ball 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.230
 One bounce in the opponent's coat In his coat 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.280
 Two-bound eyes to be bound 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.930
 It is the place where it falls. 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 It is a feeling to swing it and it is small vertically 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.069
 Please swing the racket before this time 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.250
 Because if you move it it will blow off instead of being a stop 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.590
 Be sure to drop something vertically 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.890
 Please be aware Next is the third point 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.590
 The third point is more than cutting 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.390
 It's like sliding over a rubber 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.599
 Of course I can do it on the back or front 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.400
 When I cut it off as an image 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.110
 I'll make my own rotation I'll make my lower rotation 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.480
 Or it is influenced by the rotation of the opponent and 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.940
 Because there is a possibility of jumping out 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.860
 It makes it slip and slips 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440
 It may be good if you have an image 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.099
 In the feeling that it almost touches or does not touch 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.209
 Not affected by the opponent's rotation 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.980
 It feels like touching with a weak shallow touch 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.590
 It is point to make this touch 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.140
 It comes in from the top and is the lower part of the racket 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.879
 As you hit the lower one, you will be turning by yourself 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.950
 It is a little root or above The grip side of the root racket 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.650
 To the point where the upper one gets a great turn 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.590
 It's supposed to take a bit in that area 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.780
 It's very easy for me to rotate 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.180
 To hit at such points 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.390
 Please be aware that the racket is vertical 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.750
 It is wonderfully soft when it falls down 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.700
 Soft touch Soft or weak touch 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.629
 I only touch it so I can hardly touch it 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.260
 At the root or above with a touch that does not touch 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.510
 If you have a conscious awareness 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.390
 If there is a stop that leaves such rotation 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.250
 I think please try it by all means
