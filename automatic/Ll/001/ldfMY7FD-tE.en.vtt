00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
go three from the top one two three

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.600 
go three from the top one two three
actually<00:01:24.270> make<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.570> four<00:01:25.400> four<00:01:26.400> from<00:01:26.580> the

top and push in here with a toothpick or
something<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> use

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
something like this which is what I use

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
something like this which is what I use
it's<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.790> allen<00:01:33.060> key<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's like an allen key that I'm going to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.020 
it's like an allen key that I'm going to
be<00:01:33.720> using<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.100> internals<00:01:35.579> remove<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
be using for the internals remove the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
be using for the internals remove the
screws<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> works<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:36.990> nicely<00:01:37.259> with

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
screws but it works really nicely with

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
screws but it works really nicely with
going<00:01:38.549> through<00:01:38.820> these<00:01:39.000> holes<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.930> fits

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
going through these holes it fits

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.880 
going through these holes it fits
perfectly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
perfectly

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.090 
perfectly
so<00:01:41.990> anyways<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.259> same<00:01:43.470> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> bottom

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so anyways the same with the bottom

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
so anyways the same with the bottom
which<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.520> already<00:01:44.820> moved<00:01:45.030> four<00:01:45.450> time<00:01:46.130> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
which I've already moved four time this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.660 
which I've already moved four time this
is<00:01:47.310> an<00:01:47.490> easy<00:01:47.640> part<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> operation<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.340> yes

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is an easy part of the operation so yes

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
is an easy part of the operation so yes
those<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.210> removed<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:52.049> you're<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.229> to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
your fingers you can open these clamps I

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.020 
your fingers you can open these clamps I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
definitely recommend using the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.860 
definitely recommend using the
screwdriver<00:02:33.650> but<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.750> partial<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
screwdriver but that's all partial to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.840 
screwdriver but that's all partial to
you<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:41.340> probably<00:02:41.430> easier

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
you so here we go it's probably easier

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.340 
you so here we go it's probably easier
to<00:02:41.910> lay<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.360> its<00:02:42.390> side<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.750> this

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
to lay it on its side like this

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.160 
to lay it on its side like this
so<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> little<00:02:44.310> leverage<00:02:45.170> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so you have a little leverage and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.380 
so you have a little leverage and
pushing<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:51.800> okay<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.010> side<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.370> done<00:02:53.400> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
pushing and okay this side is done the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.340 
pushing and okay this side is done the
back<00:02:54.710> there<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:56.330> clips<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:58.050> you're<00:02:58.170> going<00:02:58.320> to
