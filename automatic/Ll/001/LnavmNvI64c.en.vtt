 hello to all guys well found in the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.529
 my channel I am blasi that in 68 and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.849
 welcome to this new video then 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.009
 today I will show you how 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.380
 complete ex kyu shin training 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.359
 do kai ochine in short, whatever you want 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.309
 call it you but first of all you need to 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.129
 make an introduction 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:33.350
 guys I sincerely recommend you 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.000
 be first at level 93 before 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.500
 start training with him 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.629
 this because to have access 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.480
 at the last training that is the one 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.780
 which will have you unlock potential 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
 or potential unlocked released as 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.950
 you want to call it you 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.680
 we absolutely must be level 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.130
 93 is a mandatory thing therefore the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.329
 I advise you to find and if you find it 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.940
 already start making a few millions 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.710
 so, however, concentrate on raga above all 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.649
 to make the parallels to go up by 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.329
 level this is a fundamental thing 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.700
 so once found caio the xin 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.979
 first thing he will ask us to do and to 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.930
 find him two girls this thing is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.299
 very simple indeed you have to go to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.999
 team registration desk after that 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.789
 find girls around 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:21.799
 also on the flyin click triangle 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.999
 next to them and then click 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.859
 start option ie to recruit one 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.990
 time recruit two girls and that's it 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.520
 come back to him and then give you it is 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 the first mission succeeded 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.240
 training 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.970
 to unlock the second mission not 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.020
 all you have to do is do missions 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.760
 parallel 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 I can give you advice if you can 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.900
 try to continually do the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.360
 parallel number one for example that raga 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.000
 however being of high level the 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.370
 managed to do in less than a minute e 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.200
 however the friendship bar rises 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.780
 in fact the last missions I did 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.300
 just like that and now let it be that I have 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 had to do so many parallels of 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.800
 act level proper of the third to be said to 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.850
 part to unlock moves and then to 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.380
 to level up 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.930
 but if you want a method enough 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 fast I advise you to do the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.370
 parallel number one and see just 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.500
 you of how much the bar is raised 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.480
 of the friendship of caio ski for 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.040
 check the bar of course and that's it 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.950
 click option 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.660
 go to game data press r1 two 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.090
 times and should all appear 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.400
 masters in which you can see the bar of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.280
 kyu shin to start the third instead 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.470
 training should be mandatory 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 the level 93 of your character 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.910
 then the advice I gave you before 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.860
 and arrive first at level 93 and then vi 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.860
 try your hand at the caio sheen tests 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.210
 no 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.379
 once the third is completed 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.599
 training if you are just level 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.330
 and 93 there will be nothing left but to start 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.110
 unrewarding to get it unlocks 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.110
 potential 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.870
 no 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.449
 once terminated kyu shin ritual vi 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.069
 will ask to wait for a minute, I will 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.800
 I really recommend waiting for it 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.610
 if you move he will tell you that he will have to 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.610
 do it all over again 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.710
 as for it unlocks it 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.099
 potential and tell you what it does in practice 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.810
 from a sharp increase in statistics 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.539
 but this will mean that we cannot 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.370
 however use the supreme as many times 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.439
 we want because in passisti we will use one 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.379
 supreme our classroom will be lowered 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.750
 normally then unlocks it 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.949
 does not function on this yango 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.169
 super vegeta 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.469
 therefore it is up to you then to choose which one 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.330
 use this jan with super vegetables 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.430
 unlocks potential so guys me 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.330
 I hope this tutorial has been there 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.069
