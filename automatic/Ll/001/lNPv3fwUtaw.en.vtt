00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.240 
never really had that before and I'm
excited<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.470> around<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.890> they

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
excited for it this time around so they

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.789 
excited for it this time around so they
said<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.000> co-op<00:01:24.360> they've<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
said because it's co-op they've had to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
said because it's co-op they've had to
change<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.700> works<00:01:26.909> obviously<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
change the way it works obviously so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
change the way it works obviously so
there<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.290> much<00:01:28.470> larger<00:01:28.740> environments<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
there are much larger environments it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.010 
there are much larger environments it's
going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.119> fighting<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.720> well<00:01:30.960> as

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to be fighting in as well as

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.300 
going to be fighting in as well as
there's<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> new<00:01:31.290> animation<00:01:31.680> system<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
there's a new animation system and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
there's a new animation system and
they've<00:01:32.430> completely<00:01:32.880> redesigned<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> way

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
they've completely redesigned the way

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
they've completely redesigned the way
that<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> AI<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> react<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that the AI are going to react to you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.679 
that the AI are going to react to you
because<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:35.970> obviously<00:01:36.450> sometimes

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
because you know obviously sometimes

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.149 
because you know obviously sometimes
need<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.110> by<00:01:37.229> yourself<00:01:37.320> sometimes<00:01:37.950> may

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
need to be by yourself sometimes may

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.620 
need to be by yourself sometimes may
have<00:01:38.250> multiple<00:01:38.610> people<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.479> they've

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have multiple people with you so they've

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.880 
have multiple people with you so they've
got<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.960> smarter<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.500> they've<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.770> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
got to be smarter so they've kind of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.649 
got to be smarter so they've kind of
like<00:01:41.430> improved<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> AI<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> function

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
like improved the AI in that function

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
like improved the AI in that function
and<00:01:43.470> they've<00:01:43.799> also<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.100> twenty<00:01:44.640> different

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and they've also got twenty different

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
and they've also got twenty different
types<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> enemies<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.380> everything

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
types of enemies so there's everything

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
types of enemies so there's everything
from<00:01:46.890> fighting<00:01:47.250> against<00:01:47.579> humans<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.360> fighting

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
from fighting against humans to fighting

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539 
from fighting against humans to fighting
against<00:01:48.930> bipedal<00:01:49.380> robots<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.100> robots<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
against bipedal robots or robots that

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
against bipedal robots or robots that
have<00:01:50.610> two<00:01:50.880> legs<00:01:51.119> -<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.899> drones<00:01:52.229> flying

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
have two legs - you know drones flying

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
have two legs - you know drones flying
around<00:01:52.799> drones<00:01:53.280> rolling<00:01:53.640> around<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
around drones rolling around on the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
around drones rolling around on the
ground<00:01:54.060> there's<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.600> kinds<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> crazy<00:01:55.290> stuff

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
ground there's all kinds of crazy stuff

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
ground there's all kinds of crazy stuff
and<00:01:56.250> we've<00:01:56.460> only<00:01:56.549> seen<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.570> tip<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and we've only seen the very tip of the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
and we've only seen the very tip of the
iceberg<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.159> also<00:01:59.369> said<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
iceberg there and they also said that

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.219 
iceberg there and they also said that
rather<00:02:00.060> than<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> normal<00:02:00.840> call<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
rather than a normal call to the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
rather than a normal call to the
campaign<00:02:01.710> where<00:02:02.189> everything's<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.759> bit<00:02:02.939> more

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
campaign where everything's a bit more

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.999 
campaign where everything's a bit more
structured<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.799> where

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
structured and like they know where

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.050 
structured and like they know where
you're<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.670> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> bring

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you're gonna be so they kind of bring

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.700 
you're gonna be so they kind of bring
the<00:02:06.240> action<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.079> stuff<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the action to you and stuff like that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.559 
the action to you and stuff like that
it's<00:02:08.459> more<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> explore

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
it's more of like you get to explore

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.089 
it's more of like you get to explore
around<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.050> bit<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.410> again<00:02:10.800> with

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
around a little bit because again with

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.000 
around a little bit because again with
that<00:02:11.340> co-op<00:02:11.550> feature<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.599> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
that co-op feature you're going to have

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.679 
that co-op feature you're going to have
people<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.580> multiple<00:02:13.730> different<00:02:14.030> spaces<00:02:14.569> so

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:14.689 
people in multiple different spaces so

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.240 
people in multiple different spaces so
it's<00:02:14.810> not<00:02:14.959> like<00:02:15.170> they<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.349> really<00:02:15.680> bring<00:02:16.069> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
it's not like they can really bring the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
it's not like they can really bring the
action<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.780> more<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.470> got

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
action to you it's more of like you got

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.140 
action to you it's more of like you got
to<00:02:18.709> find<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.069> action<00:02:19.430> yourself<00:02:19.849> which<00:02:20.120> is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
to find the action yourself which is

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.110 
to find the action yourself which is
kind<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.540> cool<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.989> they<00:02:21.860> also<00:02:22.040> said<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.700> you

systems which is Direct Energy air
defense<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.500> significantly

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
defense and that significantly

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.909 
defense and that significantly
restricted<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.510> air<00:03:56.690> superiority<00:03:57.199> factor

restricted the air superiority factor

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.500 
restricted the air superiority factor
and<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.220> made<00:03:58.370> countries<00:03:58.790> take<00:03:58.970> on<00:03:59.090> more<00:03:59.209> boots

on the ground approach so it's gonna be

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.770 
on the ground approach so it's gonna be
more<00:04:01.159> ground<00:04:01.430> fighting<00:04:01.849> than<00:04:02.239> it<00:04:02.329> is<00:04:02.449> up<00:04:02.659> in
