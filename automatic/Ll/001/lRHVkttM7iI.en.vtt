eventually result in cardiac and
respiratory<00:00:37.350> arrest<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> very

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
respiratory arrest so this is a very

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
respiratory arrest so this is a very

very interested in we have taken the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
function of desmond and to see if the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
what is seen physiologically in

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.520 
what is seen physiologically in
specifically<00:00:57.300> mice<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.140> had<00:00:58.350> been

specifically mice that had been
engineered<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.070> quack<00:00:59.879> doesn't<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> our

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
engineered to quack doesn't it so our

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
engineered to quack doesn't it so our
putative<00:01:02.969> function<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.019> desmond<00:01:04.920> acts

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.559 
laterally by a desmond element which is
modeled<00:02:48.379> as<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> linear<00:02:48.919> spring<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.419> spring

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
modeled as a linear spring the spring

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.599 
modeled as a linear spring the spring
constant<00:02:51.049> for<00:02:51.349> this<00:02:51.439> element<00:02:51.829> we<00:02:52.040> took<00:02:52.400> from

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
constant for this element we took from

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.379 
constant for this element we took from
the<00:02:53.000> literature<00:02:54.159> as<00:02:55.159> well<00:02:55.489> as<00:02:55.700> 17<00:02:56.209> other

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
the literature as well as 17 other

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.179 
the literature as well as 17 other
parameters<00:02:56.719> from<00:02:57.169> the<00:02:57.319> model<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.919> we<00:02:58.040> really

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
parameters from the model so we really

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.929 
parameters from the model so we really
tried<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.489> focus<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:59.209> model<00:02:59.540> on<00:03:00.219> what<00:03:01.219> is

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
tried to focus the model on what is

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.140 
tried to focus the model on what is
physiologically<00:03:04.939> true<00:03:05.239> about<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.659> real<00:03:06.230> fiber

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
physiologically true about a real fiber

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.409 
physiologically true about a real fiber
so<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.750> we<00:03:09.620> did<00:03:09.859> two<00:03:10.400> different<00:03:10.639> kinds<00:03:11.329> of

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
so we we did two different kinds of

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.890 
so we we did two different kinds of
simulations<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:13.359> investigate<00:03:14.359> this<00:03:14.510> model

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
simulations to investigate this model

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.649 
simulations to investigate this model
the<00:03:15.079> first<00:03:15.650> was<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.280> simulate<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.389> fiber

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
the first was to simulate the fiber

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.439 
the first was to simulate the fiber
stretching<00:03:18.169> passively<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.400> essentially<00:03:20.060> we

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
stretching passively so essentially we

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.580 
stretching passively so essentially we
just<00:03:20.599> grabbed<00:03:20.870> onto<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.319> ends<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.010> home<00:03:22.489> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
just grabbed onto the ends and home and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.030 
just grabbed onto the ends and home and
we<00:03:24.590> found<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.159> the<00:03:26.150> alignment<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.169> Z<00:03:27.620> disks

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
we found that the alignment of Z disks

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.699 
we found that the alignment of Z disks
as<00:03:28.220> measured<00:03:28.879> as<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.319> difference<00:03:30.319> between

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
as measured as the difference between

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.939 
as measured as the difference between
the<00:03:30.799> position<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.430> two<00:03:31.879> adjacent<00:03:32.329> Z<00:03:32.750> discs<00:03:33.109> was

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
the position of two adjacent Z discs was

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.330 
the position of two adjacent Z discs was
increased<00:03:34.699> if<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.299> fiber<00:03:35.569> mat<00:03:35.959> dozen<00:03:36.500> so

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
increased if the fiber mat dozen so

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.170 
increased if the fiber mat dozen so
let's<00:03:37.549> show<00:03:37.760> here<00:03:38.299> in<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:39.040> where<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.549> y-axis

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
let's show here in a where the y-axis

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.189 
let's show here in a where the y-axis
shows<00:03:41.349> misalignment<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:44.169> x-axis<00:03:45.169> shows

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
shows misalignment and the x-axis shows

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.640 
shows misalignment and the x-axis shows
increasing<00:03:46.040> stretch<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.449> what<00:03:47.629> we<00:03:47.720> see<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.259> in

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
increasing stretch so what we see is in

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.210 
increasing stretch so what we see is in

with<00:03:56.540> increasing<00:03:56.870> stretch<00:03:57.759> the<00:03:58.989> picture<00:03:59.989> next

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:00.259 
with increasing stretch the picture next

with increasing stretch the picture next
to<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.919> actually<00:04:01.159> a<00:04:01.400> quantification<00:04:01.879> of

to it is actually a quantification of

to it is actually a quantification of
the<00:04:03.790> experimental<00:04:04.790> data<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.479> I've<00:04:05.900> got<00:04:06.500> over

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
the experimental data that I've got over

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.699 
the experimental data that I've got over
here<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.239> see<00:04:08.449> that<00:04:08.479> it<00:04:09.109> shows<00:04:09.680> a

here and you can see that it shows a

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.330 
here and you can see that it shows a
similar<00:04:10.250> trend<00:04:10.549> where<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.769> fiber<00:04:12.769> lacking

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
similar trend where the fiber lacking

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.360 
similar trend where the fiber lacking
Desmond<00:04:13.819> has<00:04:14.150> an<00:04:14.540> increased<00:04:15.370> misalignment

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
Desmond has an increased misalignment

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.500 
Desmond has an increased misalignment
and<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.840> misalignment<00:04:18.470> increases

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
and that misalignment increases

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.440 
and that misalignment increases
increase<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.020> stretch<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.400> that's<00:04:22.000> good<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
increase of stretch so that's good it

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.210 
increase of stretch so that's good it
seems<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:23.920> reasonable

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
seems like that this is a reasonable

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.070 
seems like that this is a reasonable

between G discs Oh secondly we also

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.330 
between G discs Oh secondly we also
simulated<00:04:34.270> isometric<00:04:34.900> stress<00:04:35.440> which<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.070> the

simulated isometric stress which is the

wild-type<00:04:49.630> fibers<00:04:50.260> shown<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.560> blue<00:04:50.800> which<00:04:51.430> has

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
wild-type fibers shown in blue which has

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.140 
wild-type fibers shown in blue which has
also<00:04:51.880> been<00:04:52.480> documented<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> literature

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
also been documented in the literature

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.090 
also been documented in the literature
interestingly<00:04:55.150> though<00:04:55.780> we<00:04:56.410> varied<00:04:57.100> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
interestingly though we varied the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.570 
interestingly though we varied the
Desmond<00:04:57.670> concentration<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.500> fiber<00:04:59.950> as

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
Desmond concentration in the fiber as

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.330 
Desmond concentration in the fiber as
well<00:05:00.790> as<00:05:00.940> its<00:05:01.090> location<00:05:01.660> within<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.140> fiber<00:05:02.350> so

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
well as its location within the fiber so

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.630 
well as its location within the fiber so
we<00:05:03.910> found<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.600> as<00:05:05.050> you<00:05:05.560> increase<00:05:05.640> devlin

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
we found that as you increase devlin

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.330 
we found that as you increase devlin
concentration<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:08.560> got<00:05:08.860> this<00:05:09.010> sort<00:05:09.250> of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
concentration you got this sort of

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.860 
concentration you got this sort of
nonlinear<00:05:10.210> logarithmic<00:05:10.960> type<00:05:11.470> curve<00:05:12.400> and

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
nonlinear logarithmic type curve and

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.360 
nonlinear logarithmic type curve and
this<00:05:13.870> was<00:05:14.050> especially<00:05:14.290> interesting<00:05:15.160> because

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
this was especially interesting because

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.180 
this was especially interesting because
there<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.390> a<00:05:16.420> study<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:17.350> was<00:05:17.410> done<00:05:17.590> by

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
there is a study that was done by

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.030 
there is a study that was done by
another<00:05:18.520> girl<00:05:18.910> in<00:05:19.060> my<00:05:19.180> lab<00:05:19.440> where<00:05:20.440> she<00:05:20.740> showed

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
another girl in my lab where she showed

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.840 
another girl in my lab where she showed
that<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:22.260> injury<00:05:23.260> resulting<00:05:23.950> from<00:05:24.220> eccentric

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
that the injury resulting from eccentric

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.960 
that the injury resulting from eccentric
contraction<00:05:25.390> which<00:05:26.170> can<00:05:27.010> be<00:05:27.280> correlated<00:05:27.610> to

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
contraction which can be correlated to

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.060 
contraction which can be correlated to
initial<00:05:28.840> stress<00:05:29.410> production<00:05:29.980> by<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.940> Muslim

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
initial stress production by a Muslim

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.050 
initial stress production by a Muslim
actually<00:05:33.070> has<00:05:33.280> that<00:05:33.520> same<00:05:33.790> type<00:05:34.030> of

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
actually has that same type of

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.570 
actually has that same type of
logarithmic<00:05:34.630> curve<00:05:35.670> and<00:05:36.990> also<00:05:37.990> interestingly

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
logarithmic curve and also interestingly

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.360 
logarithmic curve and also interestingly
we<00:05:39.580> found<00:05:39.880> that<00:05:40.210> if<00:05:40.630> we<00:05:40.990> localize<00:05:41.500> desmond<00:05:42.070> to

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
we found that if we localize desmond to

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.610 
we found that if we localize desmond to
the<00:05:42.730> exterior<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.720> fiber<00:05:43.960> where<00:05:44.440> the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
the exterior of the fiber where the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.950 
the exterior of the fiber where the
membrane<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.370> extracellular<00:05:46.360> matrix

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
membrane and the extracellular matrix

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.400 
membrane and the extracellular matrix
are<00:05:47.200> we<00:05:48.160> actually<00:05:48.640> found<00:05:48.910> a<00:05:49.450> much<00:05:50.110> greater

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
are we actually found a much greater

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.980 
are we actually found a much greater
increase<00:05:50.980> in<00:05:51.250> stress<00:05:51.610> production<00:05:52.150> for<00:05:52.960> a

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
increase in stress production for a

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.040 
increase in stress production for a
given<00:05:53.410> concentration<00:05:54.030> relative<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.300> if<00:05:55.750> it

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
given concentration relative to if it

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.220 
given concentration relative to if it
had<00:05:56.350> been<00:05:56.640> distributed<00:05:57.640> randomly<00:05:58.030> or<00:05:58.390> focused

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
had been distributed randomly or focused

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.070 
had been distributed randomly or focused
in<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.470> center<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.890> fiber<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:01.270> this<00:06:01.870> is

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
in the center of the fiber so this is

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.380 
in the center of the fiber so this is
this<00:06:02.740> is<00:06:02.860> where<00:06:03.040> we<00:06:03.160> plan<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.670> concentrate<00:06:04.360> our

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
this is where we plan to concentrate our

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.380 
this is where we plan to concentrate our
future<00:06:04.990> work<00:06:05.200> in<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:06.100> model<00:06:06.760> maybe<00:06:07.030> trying

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
future work in this model maybe trying

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.040 
future work in this model maybe trying
to<00:06:07.630> design<00:06:07.930> some<00:06:08.230> experiments<00:06:08.920> to<00:06:09.040> see<00:06:09.280> if

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
to design some experiments to see if

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.810 
to design some experiments to see if
there<00:06:11.050> is<00:06:11.080> actually<00:06:11.770> increased<00:06:12.160> localization

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
there is actually increased localization

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.860 
there is actually increased localization
of<00:06:12.910> desmond<00:06:13.300> at<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.780> fiber<00:06:14.440> memory
