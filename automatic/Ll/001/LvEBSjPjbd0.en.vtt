artists<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.780> think<00:01:32.929> those<00:01:33.080> are<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.380> should

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:38.020 
take place I think that their statements
should<00:01:36.830> be<00:01:36.979> released<00:01:37.280> they<00:01:37.520> should<00:01:37.700> come<00:01:37.819> from

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
should be released they should come from

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.969 
should be released they should come from
independent<00:01:38.479> party<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:38.840> I'm<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:39.619> favor<00:01:39.860> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979

official<00:02:41.290> statements<00:02:41.769> that<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.090> don't

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
official statements that we just don't

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
guess coming back to the main point is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.250 
guess coming back to the main point is
that<00:02:47.769> even<00:02:47.950> talking<00:02:48.670> about<00:02:48.760> gold<00:02:49.239> are<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
that even talking about gold are you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
that even talking about gold are you
seeing<00:02:50.560> some<00:02:50.739> kind<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:50.980> gyro<00:02:51.220> gold<00:02:51.609> link<00:02:51.909> at

navigated<00:05:21.479> a<00:05:21.539> strong<00:05:21.840> dollar<00:05:22.050> I<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.710> would<00:05:23.190> say

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
navigated a strong dollar I I would say

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.309 
navigated a strong dollar I I would say
that<00:05:23.430> if<00:05:23.819> we<00:05:23.940> had<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> strong<00:05:24.509> dollar<00:05:24.720> policy

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
that if we had a strong dollar policy

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.080 
that if we had a strong dollar policy
and<00:05:25.530> better<00:05:25.710> economic<00:05:26.340> policies<00:05:26.819> and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
and better economic policies and

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.659 
and better economic policies and
stronger<00:05:27.870> growth<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.860> probably<00:05:29.159> wouldn't

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
stronger growth we probably wouldn't

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.580 
stronger growth we probably wouldn't
would<00:05:30.180> not<00:05:30.360> have<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.870> go<00:05:30.990> back<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.319> the<00:05:31.349> gold

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
would not have to go back to the gold

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.290 
would not have to go back to the gold
standard<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:32.460> because<00:05:32.789> we're<00:05:33.000> trying<00:05:33.210> to

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
standard but because we're trying to

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.640 
standard but because we're trying to
trash<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.720> current<00:05:34.050> scene<00:05:34.199> because<00:05:34.470> we're

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
trash the current scene because we're

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.770 
trash the current scene because we're
hurting<00:05:34.919> growth<00:05:34.949> at<00:05:35.400> some<00:05:36.060> point<00:05:36.300> people<00:05:36.419> lose

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
hurting growth at some point people lose

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.529 
hurting growth at some point people lose
confidence<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.440> you'll<00:05:37.530> be<00:05:37.650> forced<00:05:38.009> to<00:05:38.159> do<00:05:38.280> it

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
confidence and you'll be forced to do it

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.969 
confidence and you'll be forced to do it
one<00:05:39.539> way<00:05:39.690> or<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:39.810> other<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.320> it's<00:05:40.530> at<00:05:40.650> least<00:05:40.770> as

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
one way or the other so it's at least as

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.030 
one way or the other so it's at least as
good<00:05:41.130> thing<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.550> have<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.820> gold
