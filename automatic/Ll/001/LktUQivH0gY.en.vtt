confused by a high fructose corn syrup
so<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> little

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
so I think it's time for a little

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.819 
so I think it's time for a little
reminder<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> stuff<00:00:40.469> really
