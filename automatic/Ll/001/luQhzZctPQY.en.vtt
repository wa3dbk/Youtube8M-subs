00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello i 'm roberto alert of the project 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.680
 finds in his own voice 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.910
 and this is the third video and we are 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.520
 making a kind of map of the first 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.750
 elements connected to the program 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.930
 I mean we speak we have one in the first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 video said we have an entire area 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.920
 which is the same physical body structure 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 of the voice and a little about it we go 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.170
 speak today 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 but first I'll comment quickly 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.060
 this exercise that I ask of you 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.880
 make these two previous videos of 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:57.090
 listening and this distinction in the voices and 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:00.600
 in speech and the perception of the qualities 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.329
 distinct entourage of voice quality 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.829
 rhythm and intensity of the color of 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.700
 emotions 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:14.490
 all this game that translates into sound and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 which is also reflected in the speech that the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 sometimes even says something else in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 what is the quality of the bet 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.220
 is zero and then I asked for you 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.130
 also see in animals 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 the voices of animals and something that I 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 I would like to point out that using 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:44.100
 animals and small children to voice 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.369
 it's all in the voice of the Union urged all 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.960
 he who today is not only today does not come from 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.220
 throat 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.720
 so the cat condemns the dog 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.540
 when latina 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.330
 it is in young children also when 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.270
 Child cries she cries all the time she 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.700
 Smile, she's all here. 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.800
 we'll grow up later, we'll start to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.910
 distance promotion and sometimes people 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:18.500
 Hides even happening behind 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.820
 a laugh a voice 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.780
 sometimes it starts to complicate the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.440
 word of the man exactly because you 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.530
 begins not only to reveal itself 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.790
 through the voice but hide through it 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.530
 the left hiding something and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.260
 reveals 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 then it is observed and also as behind 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.140
 of the speeches you are listening to and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.290
 there is a universe of meanings and 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.760
 where they happen they are like 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.840
 queen daddy given that circumstance of 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.739
 it arises then continue to make a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.830
 bit of the day 5 minutes that is 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:12.770
 hear the sounds hear the voices hear the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:16.459
 You talk to hear the noises of things too. 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.140
 these three sound levels 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.920
 sounds of things 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.459
 the voices of the animals and the speeches of the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.459
 men 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.769
 today I'll talk to you quickly 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.129
 about a muscular problem that prevents 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.780
 much that our voice prayed and we're going 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.080
 so properly that this musculature 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.379
 jaw 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.410
 this great musician who is a serious man 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:52.310
 to chew is a winning rod 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.540
 all this musculature is actually the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.170
 muscles in the animal attacking right and 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:05.739
 anger control you get angry with 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.739
 someone plays 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:19.100
 often a continuous anger but 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:22.250
 there are those who are bad you can keep 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.770
 This is going to be a bit hard and that's going to 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.600
 to hinder what relieves joint 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:33.230
 of the words of the consgoers 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.900
 so I would like you to try 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.060
 always the voltage level you have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.850
 and squeeze my victory heroes a little 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:48.770
 in all of us more in others - and you 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:54.320
 goes 23 minutes per day but at 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:57.470
 circles a little smiling and releasing 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.690
 a little and everything stays because 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.150
 eg anger happen sometimes want 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.010
 say something to someone but 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.700
 second does not allow for one or the other 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:14.090
 reason and you keep that and you 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.180
 physically lock the words in their 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.730
 planes and jaw 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.530
 then it is not an exercise in 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:28.300
 relaxation is not an exercise in 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.490
 awareness of how much you are 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.020
 working muscle without the need for 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.390
 No one is doing a job here that 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.450
 blocks the muscles but many 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.660
 times introjected this attention is not 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.850
 something that happens to you there is no tension is 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.840
 something you're doing 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.420
 it's like betraying 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.650
 so I wanted you to notice yourself 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:00.650
 movement of the lower jaw which is the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.130
 only this way you know it right 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:07.570
 sometimes we talk like that both 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.570
 standards is not only lives under 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.949
 slowly without wanting to make moves 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.569
 because it's not about doing 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:22.079
 exercise more than taking possession of 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:26.279
 a muscle that is forgotten 

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:27.989
 the small difference and will remember I did not 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:30.569
 I can forget the fear of my 

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:33.809
 musculature and often Argentine 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:38.209
 very abstract 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:41.219
 then the exercise of this video east 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:43.439
 observe massaging a people especially 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.699
 the muscles here but this one too 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:50.159
 It does not hurt to remember that it exists and 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.539
 that she is usually more tense than 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.599
 that should 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:59.780
 I assure you, this has a 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:07:02.720
 fundamental importance to speak 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.500
 so for today this is it if you are 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.270
 watching from youtube and interested by 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:15.470
