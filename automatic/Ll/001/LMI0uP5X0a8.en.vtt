00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.540
 so ladies and gentlemen while I'm here today as Hirschelmann 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.290
 These sandstone rocks smashed and I wanted to tell you something to the 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.910
 from the most hated equipment in mine 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.910
 deprived photographic equipment namely give tripod 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.039
 I personally try on the tripod approach as much as possible too 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.099
 refuse a suitcase conversation Thomes what you through the area 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.359
 I just do not have to drag and logs about it because I hear it 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.280
 Exposure times from half a second to two seconds mountainous eleven 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 I have no one else to hold or fear to do that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.320
 and that 's why I wanted you today a memorial tripod that' s a my photo 190 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.700
 introduce xb 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.980
 an Arno tripod reduced "very very nice weather firmly and stably built 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.770
 Nevertheless, it is still light and reasonably handy 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.950
 like tripod, there are now as a successor son as 190 x per b also 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.489
 for still professional photographer probably 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.210
 and then has just so further developed details such as an imponderable 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.840
 Middle should 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.700
 So the tripod is a classic three-legged tripod with a three-piece tripod 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.100
 NPA an excerpt 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.420
 These Weiners trains can be operated with one hand that means I have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.940
 Here's a place 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.219
 I can solve Clemen with one hand 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.530
 the city is deep in length 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.049
 adjust and then determine accordingly again in one hand 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.100
 Furthermore, two of these tripod legs are covered with moss green to touch 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.040
 when I'm out in the cold, Aluh will 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.719
 Metal objects, of course, become cold very quickly and so often 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.980
 in a certain isolation against the cold 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.920
 Mitchell should be next to intelligent and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.410
 then call three different spreitz and lock 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.140
 that gives me the opportunity in situations like now here where i have little 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 Have space where I can show the legs in different directions accordingly 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.400
 would like to work and with a lower or higher food of the web 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.040
 would like to set up the tripod safely 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.710
 On the native drivers tripod sits a tripod head this tripod is head 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.480
 to order separately that means you can choose the one you prefer 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.760
 Combination of tripod and tripod KOF 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.539
 assemble, so to speak 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.019
 and in my case, the tripod head is a 322 rc2 that is 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.110
 a Kohnke often also from man photo 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 I have put the tripod head on left-handed operation one 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.510
 but can also be left by default in the resourceful designs 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.270
 At the beginning of the kick you see a viable and I press 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.089
 through these development goals I can give those to Cogenco 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.999
 Immediately all imaginable directions are moving 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.499
 and as soon as I let go of this development aid, the cut head is immediately 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.459
 in the appropriate position and IT so very good for fast laxey 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.990
 pale and work 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.469
 and how is the camera going on tour tripod head now 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.539
 I'm also an expert on the camera for screwing this 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.560
 square metallic plate and private normal in the piece if connection 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.500
 West turned 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.610
 and then you have to give the tripod head to solve little boys love 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.229
 Team Development 7 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:05.259
 zurücklagen and a schnapps which the deep view the Plate the 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.469
 Quick release plate fell against the stance on the tripod 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.909
 Development Assistance 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.099
 Lock again lock pin ski and ready 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.260
 either way, the camera would have the camera from the tripod at any time 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.210
 take or put back on the tripod and the whole 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.069
 in a few seconds 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.089
 The general problem with a three-legged tripod remains natural 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:28.819
 It's hard to do something similar here. "You have to do it with them 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.449
 Grinding is always called when 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.939
 pa course EAD or 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.320
 Percent weight play a role I have an attractive one here 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.970
 We had this little Cham tripod that is an anniversaries Gorillapod 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:44.429
 consists essentially of a connection for a tripod head 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:48.039
 or you can also directly turn Isis thread into your camera 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:53.229
 and three flexible legs which one around each object a Licher umemmende 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.099
 Zingster can attach any object and so on 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.099
 Stöcklin Kammerer can realize points of view 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.939
 This system is of course much more flexible and essentially official 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.729
 much easier to transport 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.759
 but that was still the problem that you could not do anywhere 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.849
 you would like to be able to use his life in the location as well 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.019
 whether a classic driver tripod in Cham tripod or maybe just 30 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.639
 10 with increasingly that each of you must decide for yourself whichever 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.650
 Recording situation you wanted to photograph which environment here and 

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:26.319
 which has to be expected for closing times here 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.580
 the links to the we put pages I'll give you in the info box and then 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.650
 I would say 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.159
 up soon
