swirling and diving he never flies a
straight<00:01:18.630> line<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> would<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
straight line because then you would be

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
straight line because then you would be
able<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> nab<00:01:20.520> him<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.140> swirling
