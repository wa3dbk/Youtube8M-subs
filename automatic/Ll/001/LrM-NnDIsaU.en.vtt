00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
around here just so I wouldn't suck it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.170 
around here just so I wouldn't suck it
up<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> intake<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:41.610> don't<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

up through the intake and I don't have
the<00:00:42.300> fuel<00:00:42.510> lines<00:00:42.750> hooked<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.350> now<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the fuel lines hooked up right now I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
the fuel lines hooked up right now I
don't<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.550> what's<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> tank<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.329> there's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
don't know what's in the tank if there's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.430 
don't know what's in the tank if there's
even<00:00:45.750> anything<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> tank<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:48.629> may<00:00:48.930> start

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
even anything in the tank it may start

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
even anything in the tank it may start
pumping<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> fuel<00:00:50.309> pump<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> gets

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
pumping out the fuel pump when it gets

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.900 
pumping out the fuel pump when it gets
running<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.020> gets<00:00:52.199> running<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.850> making<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
running if it gets running and making a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360 
running if it gets running and making a
mess<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> contaminate<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
mess but I don't want to contaminate the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150 
mess but I don't want to contaminate the
carburetors<00:00:56.879> again<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> fuel<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.829> we

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
carburetors again with that fuel so we

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
carburetors again with that fuel so we
have<00:00:59.370> two-stroke<00:01:00.300> fuel<00:01:00.600> filled<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have two-stroke fuel filled up in the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
have two-stroke fuel filled up in the
float<00:01:01.649> bowls<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.190> filled<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> through

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
float bowls I just filled it through

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.810 
float bowls I just filled it through
both<00:01:02.910> lines<00:01:03.920> with<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.220> squirt<00:01:05.430> bottle

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
both lines with a little squirt bottle

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.990 
both lines with a little squirt bottle
and<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> after<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> filled<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.729> squirt

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and then after that I filled up squirt

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.740 
and then after that I filled up squirt
bottle<00:01:09.270> again<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.799> primed<00:01:10.799> both<00:01:11.189> cylinders

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
bottle again and primed both cylinders

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
bottle again and primed both cylinders
so<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.560> should<00:01:13.830> kick<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:14.400> without<00:01:14.580> any

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so that it should kick off without any

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
so that it should kick off without any
yank<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.240> arm<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> socket<00:01:15.900> trying<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
yank my arm out of the socket trying to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
yank my arm out of the socket trying to
get<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.810> are

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
see if this motor is good I really don't

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.660 
see if this motor is good I really don't
care<00:02:08.289> about<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.560> snowmobile<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.399> just

care about the snowmobile I'm just

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.309 
care about the snowmobile I'm just
trying<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:11.069> assess<00:02:12.069> what<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.670> have<00:02:12.970> for<00:02:13.319> good

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
trying to assess what I have for good

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.890 
trying to assess what I have for good
parts<00:02:15.150> let's<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.239> if<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:16.390> got<00:02:16.540> some<00:02:16.750> good

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
parts let's see if we got some good

00:02:16.900 --> 00:03:05.440 
parts let's see if we got some good
parts<00:02:17.170> as<00:02:17.500> far<00:02:17.709> as<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.860> motor<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.160> concerned

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.760 

well<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.890> would<00:03:07.890> definitely<00:03:08.010> call<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:09.770> smoky

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
well I would definitely call that smoky

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:20.930 
well I would definitely call that smoky
cold<00:03:11.010> start<00:03:16.010> there<00:03:19.340> see<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> mouse<00:03:20.610> come<00:03:20.820> out

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
cold start there see the mouse come out

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.160 
cold start there see the mouse come out
of<00:03:21.060> there<00:03:21.150> now

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.750 

that<00:03:26.740> looks<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:30.010> scene<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.400> Animal

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that looks like the scene in Animal

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.560 
that looks like the scene in Animal
House<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:33.880> seems<00:03:34.060> like<00:03:34.120> we<00:03:34.270> got<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.450> good

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
House so it seems like we got a good

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.350 
House so it seems like we got a good
motor<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.370> again<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.400> wish<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.730> was<00:03:36.880> air-cooled

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
motor and again I wish it was air-cooled

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.120 
motor and again I wish it was air-cooled
be<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> lot<00:03:37.600> simpler<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.140> install<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.710> believe

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
be a lot simpler to install I believe

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.360 
be a lot simpler to install I believe
there<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.910> radiator<00:03:40.480> up<00:03:40.980> under<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.100> track

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
there is a radiator up under the track

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.550 
there is a radiator up under the track
and<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.660> have<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.870> get<00:03:49.990> put<00:03:50.440> in

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
and so that would have to get put in

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.970 
and so that would have to get put in
this<00:03:50.680> some<00:03:51.460> location<00:03:51.910> also<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.350> think<00:03:53.920> we

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
this some location also but I think we

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.949 
this some location also but I think we
make<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.340> good<00:03:54.580> drive<00:03:55.180> trains<00:03:55.450> get<00:03:55.750> out

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
make a really good drive trains get out

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.370 
make a really good drive trains get out
below<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.260> smoke<00:03:56.590> here<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.180> have<00:03:58.180> an<00:03:58.300> icy<00:03:58.630> CVT

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
below the smoke here I have an icy CVT

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.560 
below the smoke here I have an icy CVT
