into<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.750> warehouse<00:01:01.109> here's<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
into this this warehouse here's how it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
into this this warehouse here's how it
works<00:01:02.309> first<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.210> need<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> spot<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
works first you need a spot for a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.100 
works first you need a spot for a
vegetable<00:01:04.589> oil<00:01:04.830> tape<00:01:05.220> well<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.930> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
vegetable oil tape well what we do is we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950 
vegetable oil tape well what we do is we
actually<00:01:07.229> replace<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.490> spare<00:01:08.850> tire<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
actually replace the spare tire with a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500 
actually replace the spare tire with a
tank<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:11.250> under<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> hood<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> converter

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
tank then under the hood the converter

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
tank then under the hood the converter
is<00:01:12.720> installed<00:01:13.229> since<00:01:13.950> cars<00:01:14.310> can't<00:01:14.670> run

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

strictly<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.630> vegetable<00:01:16.170> oil<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.040> diesel

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
strictly on vegetable oil you use diesel

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.850 
strictly on vegetable oil you use diesel
or<00:01:18.030> biodiesel<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> car<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
or biodiesel to get the car going and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
or biodiesel to get the car going and
then<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> converter<00:01:20.939> uses<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.570> heat<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
then the converter uses the heat the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.560 
then the converter uses the heat the
engine<00:01:22.500> produces<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.460> turn<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> oil<00:01:23.880> into

engine produces to turn the oil into
fuel<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.860> once<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.369> car<00:01:26.580> comes<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.030> to
