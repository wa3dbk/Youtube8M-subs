00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
inside of the field what that's gonna do

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.379 
inside of the field what that's gonna do
is<00:04:16.539> it's<00:04:16.570> gonna<00:04:16.870> draw<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.820> safety<00:04:18.820> out<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.209> cover

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.420 
this happens and that's it that's all I
got<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.479> do<00:04:43.599> it's<00:04:44.349> just<00:04:44.710> all<00:04:44.919> about<00:04:45.010> getting

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
got to do it's just all about getting

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.839 
got to do it's just all about getting
that<00:04:45.520> outside<00:04:45.940> kick<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.520> would<00:04:51.700> have<00:04:51.789> made

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
that outside kick if I would have made

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:00.689 
that outside kick if I would have made
the<00:04:54.849> completion<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.750> would<00:04:56.320> stop<00:04:56.650> there<00:04:59.699> even

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
the completion I would stop there even

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.100 
the completion I would stop there even
considering<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.840> make<00:05:02.020> one<00:05:02.860> more<00:05:03.099> pass<00:05:03.780> with<00:05:04.780> a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
considering to make one more pass with a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.900 
considering to make one more pass with a
measly<00:05:05.800> three<00:05:06.690> seconds<00:05:07.690> left<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.550> mean<00:05:09.550> if<00:05:09.729> you

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
measly three seconds left I mean if you

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.500 
measly three seconds left I mean if you
have<00:05:11.280> brain<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.669> your<00:05:12.820> skull

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
have brain in your skull

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.450 
have brain in your skull
I<00:05:13.539> don't<00:05:13.870> think<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:14.800> would<00:05:15.250> do<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:17.460> if

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
I don't think that you would do it if

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.150 
I don't think that you would do it if
you<00:05:18.610> would<00:05:18.760> have<00:05:18.849> made<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.630> completion<00:05:20.169> ran

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
you would have made the completion ran

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.219 
you would have made the completion ran
out<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.340> bounds<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:24.610> would<00:05:24.729> think<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.229> a

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
out of bounds you would think that a

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.339 
out of bounds you would think that a
field<00:05:27.070> goal<00:05:27.599> would<00:05:28.599> easily<00:05:29.410> be<00:05:30.099> done<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.960> you

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
field goal would easily be done that you

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.890 
field goal would easily be done that you
know<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.919> doesn't<00:05:33.220> happen<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:33.820> do<00:05:34.720> what<00:05:34.840> I

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
know that doesn't happen just do what I

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.520 
know that doesn't happen just do what I
said<00:05:35.199> and<00:05:35.580> just<00:05:36.580> keep<00:05:37.270> on<00:05:37.479> trying<00:05:38.260> it<00:05:38.440> on

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
said and just keep on trying it on

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.510 
said and just keep on trying it on
sidekicking<00:05:39.310> at<00:05:39.460> that

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
sidekicking at that

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.999 
sidekicking at that
I<00:05:40.550> mean<00:05:40.699> if<00:05:40.879> you've<00:05:41.030> come<00:05:41.240> this<00:05:41.270> far<00:05:42.009> you

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
I mean if you've come this far you

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.230 
I mean if you've come this far you
should<00:05:43.039> be<00:05:43.280> able<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.460> march<00:05:43.669> right<00:05:43.729> down<00:05:43.940> that
