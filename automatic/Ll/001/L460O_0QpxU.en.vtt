00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
think it's a good for the sport you know

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
think it's a good for the sport you know
bringing<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> girls<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.820> making<00:01:51.119> them

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
bringing the girls in and making them

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.370 
bringing the girls in and making them
you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.939> it's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.090> male<00:01:54.479> dominant<00:01:54.990> sport<00:01:55.229> but

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you know it's a male dominant sport but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.630 
you know it's a male dominant sport but
I<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.460> both

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I don't think it is I think it's both

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760 
I don't think it is I think it's both
female<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.570> male<00:01:57.869> sport<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.469> makes<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
female and male sport and it makes a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
female and male sport and it makes a
sport<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> lot<00:01:59.520> better<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
sport you know a lot better and and it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
sport you know a lot better and and it
can<00:02:00.659> bring<00:02:00.810> girls<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> sport<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> even<00:02:02.369> if

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
can bring girls to the sport and even if

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.859 
can bring girls to the sport and even if
they<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> race<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> boys<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.540> stuff<00:02:03.630> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
they want to race the boys and stuff I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.780 
they want to race the boys and stuff I
think<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.140> makes<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.409> sport<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:05.460> good<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
think it makes a sport really good and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.880 
think it makes a sport really good and
the<00:02:05.909> public<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> view<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.320> both<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.740> us

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the public and view know both of us

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
the public and view know both of us
racing<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.000> definitely<00:02:09.420> good

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
racing so I think it's definitely good

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.809 
racing so I think it's definitely good
cam<00:02:10.379> Dawson<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> shave<00:02:11.670> your<00:02:11.910> legs

cam Dawson do you shave your legs
yes<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:16.269> elf<00:02:17.269> HR<00:02:17.749> 665<00:02:18.639> does<00:02:19.639> he<00:02:19.819> think<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
yes I do elf HR 665 does he think the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.910 
yes I do elf HR 665 does he think the
250<00:02:20.659> two-stroke<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.319> advantage<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.859> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
250 two-stroke is an advantage in the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800 
250 two-stroke is an advantage in the
Lites<00:02:22.129> class<00:02:22.249> if<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:22.999> why<00:02:23.239> doesn't<00:02:23.480> he<00:02:23.629> ride

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
Lites class if so why doesn't he ride

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.929 
Lites class if so why doesn't he ride
one<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.260> definitely<00:02:25.069> think<00:02:25.400> there's<00:02:25.609> some<00:02:25.760> ups

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
one I definitely think there's some ups

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.729 
one I definitely think there's some ups
and<00:02:26.030> downs<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> two-stroke<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.650> know

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
and downs to the two-stroke you know

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.349 
and downs to the two-stroke you know
everyone<00:02:28.159> obviously<00:02:28.459> knows<00:02:28.939> they're<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> bit

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
everyone obviously knows they're a bit

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.740 
everyone obviously knows they're a bit
quicker<00:02:30.819> but<00:02:31.819> then<00:02:32.000> saying<00:02:32.269> that<00:02:32.510> they're<00:02:32.719> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
quicker but then saying that they're a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.199 
quicker but then saying that they're a
lot<00:02:32.959> harder<00:02:33.139> to<00:02:33.439> ride<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.519> need<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> be<00:02:34.849> you

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
lot harder to ride you need to be you

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.449 
lot harder to ride you need to be you
know<00:02:35.329> physically<00:02:35.989> morph<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.439> takes<00:02:37.219> a<00:02:37.310> lot

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
know physically morph it takes a lot

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.640 
know physically morph it takes a lot
more<00:02:37.489> energy<00:02:37.730> out<00:02:37.969> of<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> whether<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.049> 250f

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
more energy out of you whether the 250f

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.399 
more energy out of you whether the 250f
is<00:02:39.859> a<00:02:39.889> lot<00:02:40.099> more<00:02:40.250> smoother<00:02:40.609> power<00:02:41.139> and<00:02:42.139> it<00:02:42.290> yeah

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
is a lot more smoother power and it yeah

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.009 
is a lot more smoother power and it yeah
it<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.709> be<00:02:42.739> easy<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.129> ride<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.639> I<00:02:43.849> rather<00:02:44.389> 250f

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
it can be easy to ride so I rather 250f

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.920 
it can be easy to ride so I rather 250f
because<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.349> prefer<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.709> 250f<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.450> obviously

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
because I prefer the 250f and obviously

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.690 
because I prefer the 250f and obviously
i<00:02:47.989> forsook<00:02:48.469> a<00:02:48.650> yamaha<00:02:49.010> r<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.430> know<00:02:49.549> there

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
two-stroke has proven to be a really top

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.770 
two-stroke has proven to be a really top
bike<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.469> know<00:03:00.590> arm<00:03:01.030> got<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.120> power<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:02.480> win

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
bike you know arm got the power to win
