ourselves but not just for ourselves but
for<00:02:35.130> our<00:02:35.340> kids<00:02:35.609> because<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.090> not

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
for our kids because I will not

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.920

homeschool because the education system

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.920 
homeschool because the education system
just<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.380> not<00:02:47.560> what<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.310> was<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:49.600> never

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
just it's not what it was it never

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.510 
just it's not what it was it never
really<00:02:50.500> has<00:02:50.980> been<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.880> should<00:02:52.360> be

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
really has been what it should be

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.890 
really has been what it should be
homeschooling<00:02:54.520> is<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:56.430> great<00:02:57.430> place<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.540> teach

your<00:02:59.080> kids<00:02:59.350> but<00:02:59.620> it's<00:02:59.800> not<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.160> everyone<00:03:00.510> it's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
your kids but it's not for everyone it's

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.840 
your kids but it's not for everyone it's
not<00:03:01.690> always<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.140> right<00:03:02.440> fit<00:03:02.800> sometimes<00:03:03.430> because

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
not always a right fit sometimes because

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.500 
not always a right fit sometimes because
of<00:03:03.880> finances<00:03:04.450> sometimes<00:03:05.230> because<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:06.760> just
