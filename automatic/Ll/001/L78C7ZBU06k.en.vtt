the players that are confident on the

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.900 
the players that are confident on the
ball<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.620> think<00:00:47.860> from<00:00:48.160> a<00:00:48.250> young<00:00:48.399> age<00:00:48.430> I

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
ball and I think from a young age I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.300 
ball and I think from a young age I
tried<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.360> duplicate<00:00:49.810> that<00:00:49.870> I'll<00:00:50.560> watch<00:00:50.980> her

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
tried to duplicate that I'll watch her

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.479 
tried to duplicate that I'll watch her
do<00:00:51.810> unpredictable<00:00:52.810> things<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.280> way<00:00:54.460> she

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
do unpredictable things the way she

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.970 
do unpredictable things the way she
touches<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.030> ball<00:00:55.270> she<00:00:56.170> sees<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.770> game<00:00:56.950> a

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
touches the ball she sees the game a

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.190 
touches the ball she sees the game a
little<00:00:57.280> bit<00:00:57.520> differently<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.149> she's<00:00:58.870> able<00:00:59.079> to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
little bit differently and she's able to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900 
little bit differently and she's able to
do<00:00:59.380> that<00:00:59.410> because<00:00:59.800> she's<00:01:00.130> just<00:01:00.430> comfortable

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
do that because she's just comfortable

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.440 
do that because she's just comfortable
with<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.030> ball

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
with a ball

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.020 
with a ball
so<00:01:01.870> she's<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.290> future<00:01:02.469> I<00:01:02.680> think<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.219> just<00:01:03.880> go

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
so she's the future I think I just go

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.969 
so she's the future I think I just go
out<00:01:04.180> there<00:01:04.449> on<00:01:04.689> days<00:01:05.379> when<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.619> want<00:01:05.829> to<00:01:05.890> get
