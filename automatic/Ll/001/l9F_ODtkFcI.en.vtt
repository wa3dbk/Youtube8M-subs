00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.950
 before 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.350
 this week was held in Bogota 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.570
 fourth version of expodefensa the fair 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.309
 international defense and security 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.740
 exhibited the novelties in armament 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.170
 manning system artillery between 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.420
 other technological advances one of the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.949
 sections that generated more curiosity was 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.960
 the one concerning the development of garments 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.029
 that the soldiers use to comply with 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.330
 his difficult labors in the middle of the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.330
 war 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.640
 outside and increase the sound of the radio 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.450
 as life keyboard 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.340
 dt 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.540
 indispensable for the radio but you 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.210
 I say that the operation 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.309
 such 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.450
 so as it presented which appears 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.450
 be the soldier of the future 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.940
 system bag for him 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.329
 of the tickets 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.150
 the well-integrated first aid system 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.800
 the hospitable man so 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.560
 adequate and we know that in these 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 conditions of our country are not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.649
 easy 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.939
 and if there are those who know about those 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.979
 difficulties are the commands 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.840
 Colombians accustomed to facing the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.460
 more difficult situations in your work 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.870
 diary in which personal protection 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.510
 it is vital 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.720
 ballistic protection more than anything else 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.460
 what is lighter and the level that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.060
 we need for the part 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 urban 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.400
 although he speaks 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:04.700
 to 64 is complementing the 5.8 and from 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.590
 long ago you have 44 % more than 65 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.569
 a power with which today the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 military forces of colombia always the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.379
 vanguard to provide them with the best 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.490
 elements to his men pleased to 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.490
 that technological development 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.590
 yes very good very good 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.050
 the technology that you are implementing 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.500
 sweep is very good we have 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.660
 barret rifles and we have done very well with 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.460
 this technology this is the last thing that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.120
 there are in technology are rifle three 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.910
 calibers in one has the caliber 300 308 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.850
 in quality 338 is a very modification 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.110
 quick sincerely released the bolts 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.300
 lift the part the rifle change the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 cannon change the bolt system 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.050
 and to the change of the development system you 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.890
 can have any of the three types of 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.890
 calibres in a single rifle 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.970
 a technological revolution that was taken 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 the night vision goggles that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.750
 they replaced the traditional green of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.880
 implement three technologies in one 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.190
 high definition device in white and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.470
 black a long distance camera and the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.720
 thermal function this is one of the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.600
 main novelties that are commented 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.640
 here in expodefensa 2014 a viewer 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.290
 night that will serve much to the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.630
 Colombian soldiers in all their 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.370
 functions let's see the change the viewer 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.680
 night that has been improved 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.840
 intensively put in it a center of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 command and control or a point where I 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.400
 I was observing what example the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.630
 group is watching live and I can 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:37.300
 send an objective care instruction 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 770 degrees to the right 300 meters and that 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.010
 Exit inside the viewfinder screen 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.849
 and with that vision of providing more life 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.590
 of the soldier 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.629
 These boxers are special for 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.080
 protect it from major wounds in 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.080
 of an explosion 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.819
 the yellow part is the one that has all 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.430
 the zones 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.769
 let's say armored if you realize this 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.409
 part is for comfort and breathing not 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.720
 this part is shielded if it is 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.900
 armored 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.430
 where 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.229
 the organism suffers more the shielding and 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.180
 can not wash with water is the great 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.310
 problem is the big breakthrough of this is 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.280
 an english technology this product is 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.270
 you can wash and then you do not lose your 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.620
 ballistic properties 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.660
 this is the soldier just washed it 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 like the rest of his clothes and he wears it 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.949
 and current become the first country 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.460
 from Latin America to experience these 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.560
 advances 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.240
 Colombia wants to go further with these 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.880
 long-sleeved interiors that by 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.979
 supposedly provide greater protection 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.289
 there is the novelty because because one has 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.150
 the sale the veins go here when 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.310
 the mine explodes is also decays in 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.410
 some vein and the person is bleeding 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 that's why we did it especially for the 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.700
 special forces we did this for you 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.650
 that's an innovation that we made 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.020
 a protection that extended to the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.970
 feet with anti-mine boots with a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.100
 super resistant sole and a lining 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.120
 interior of the same impenetrable material 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.270
 of the boxers 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 this boot is so criminal resists a 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.860
 discharge of 90 grams of pentolite 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.610
 what do you do to what happens is that 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:23.060
 the pentolite when it explodes generates a 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.479
 energy or a temperature of 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.970
 approximately 3,500 4,000 degrees 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.990
 centigrade so that cauterizes any 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.900
 body part 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.550
 with a weight of 900 grams a little less 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.830
 of one kilo and a value close to one million 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.480
 200 thousand pesos these boots are a 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.820
 true guarantee for soldiers 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.889
 Colombians so exposed to that kind of 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.289
 accidents by antipersonnel mines 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.449
 but he carries his armored back he 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.699
 used in different operations 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:54.430
 let's say infiltration whatever and 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.639
 he also has the back is in politics 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.770
 in ballistic polyethylene this backpack 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.629
 armored and this one used by the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.490
 special forces that have several 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.469
 compartments and a zipper that 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.689
 it allows to open it below without need 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.849
 to take out all things are only two 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.520
 more elements that today dress the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.169
 called soldier of the future a future of 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.370
 that every day they are closer 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.370
 courageous Colombian troops 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.750
 before
