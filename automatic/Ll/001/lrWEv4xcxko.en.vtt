00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
can pin this particular one and then

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.500 
can pin this particular one and then
we've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.210> zooming<00:00:36.380> 3d<00:00:37.670> rotating<00:00:38.670> room

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.050 
they're calling this a deep zoom feature
and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.540> zoom<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.490> quite<00:01:17.490> far<00:01:17.820> on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and I can actually zoom in quite far on

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.400 
and I can actually zoom in quite far on
the<00:01:18.150> photo<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.690> see<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.320> of

the photo and you can see it kind of

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.250 
the photo and you can see it kind of
retains<00:01:19.740> its<00:01:19.950> detail<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.550> clarity<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.260> of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
retains its detail and clarity and of

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.630 
retains its detail and clarity and of
course<00:01:22.470> since<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:22.950> full<00:01:23.160> multi-touch

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
course since it's full multi-touch
