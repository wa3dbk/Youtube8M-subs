that the door is open a little bit just
too<00:00:40.540> low<00:00:40.780> but<00:00:41.380> when<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.740> lift<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.130> pulls<00:00:42.370> up

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
too low but when you do lift it pulls up

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
putting the poles together themselves

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.290

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
so from here what to do is just take the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.560 
so from here what to do is just take the
two<00:01:18.330> ends<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.870> pop<00:01:19.560> them<00:01:19.740> into<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:21.180> eyelets

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
two ends and pop them into the eyelets

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830 
two ends and pop them into the eyelets
at<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.410> end<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.980> pool<00:01:23.130> sleeves<00:01:23.630> here<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
do is if you take the top pull and push

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.100 
do is if you take the top pull and push
that<00:01:32.400> into<00:01:32.640> position<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:33.960> easier

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that into position will be a lot easier

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.870 
that into position will be a lot easier
rather<00:01:34.710> than<00:01:34.920> trying<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> push<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.550> bottom

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.089 
that all we need to do is peg the tent
out<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.870> good<00:02:31.870> tip<00:02:32.049> here<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.650> before<00:02:32.950> we

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
out a good tip here is just before we

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.949 
out a good tip here is just before we
pegged<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.579> 10<00:02:33.760> oh<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.690> make<00:02:34.840> sure

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
pegged at the 10 oh it's just make sure

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
pegged at the 10 oh it's just make sure
the<00:02:35.110> door<00:02:35.349> at<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> front<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.549> zipped<00:02:36.880> close

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.240 

next<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.690> simply<00:02:43.989> untie<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.470> guylines<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
next we simply untie the guylines and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:56.630 
next we simply untie the guylines and
pull<00:02:45.430> them<00:02:45.640> out<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.810> peg<00:02:47.019> them<00:02:47.260> into<00:02:47.650> place

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.100 

when<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> comes<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.060> packing<00:02:58.240> down<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.690> tent<00:02:58.930> a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
when it comes to packing down the tent a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.960 
when it comes to packing down the tent a
good<00:02:59.620> idea<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.010> just<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.280> make<00:03:00.430> sure<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.790> it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
good idea is just to make sure that it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.300 
good idea is just to make sure that it's
dry<00:03:01.270> before<00:03:01.600> putting<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.560> its<00:03:02.650> bag<00:03:02.950> for

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
dry before putting it in its bag for

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.010 
dry before putting it in its bag for
storage<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.600> you're<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.930> to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
storage just so that you're not going to

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.720 
storage just so that you're not going to
get<00:03:05.200> any<00:03:05.320> mold<00:03:05.590> or<00:03:05.740> mildew<00:03:05.890> building<00:03:06.400> up<00:03:06.520> and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
get any mold or mildew building up and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.450 
get any mold or mildew building up and
the<00:03:07.060> tent<00:03:07.300> itself<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.860> take<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.160> tent<00:03:09.370> down

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
the tent itself to take the tent down

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.090 
the tent itself to take the tent down
it's<00:03:10.360> literally<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.170> reverse<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.830> what<00:03:11.890> we

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
it's literally just a reverse of what we

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.710 
it's literally just a reverse of what we
did<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.640> what<00:03:12.790> we'll<00:03:12.940> start<00:03:13.120> by<00:03:13.360> doing<00:03:13.420> is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
did so what we'll start by doing is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.360 
did so what we'll start by doing is
taking<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.110> gay<00:03:14.230> lanes<00:03:14.470> oh<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.860> willin<00:03:15.100> em<00:03:15.220> up

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
taking the gay lanes oh and willin em up

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.470 
taking the gay lanes oh and willin em up
and<00:03:15.520> tighten<00:03:15.730> them<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.210> don't<00:03:16.360> have

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
and tighten them so that you don't have

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.900 
and tighten them so that you don't have
a<00:03:16.540> big<00:03:16.780> mangled<00:03:17.200> mess<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.710> gay<00:03:17.890> lanes<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.550> then

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
a big mangled mess of gay lanes and then

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.910 
a big mangled mess of gay lanes and then
we'll<00:03:19.060> take<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.330> rain<00:03:19.510> coil<00:03:19.840> off<00:03:19.990> untie<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
fly sheet from the poles take the poles

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.660 
fly sheet from the poles take the poles
out<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.230> just<00:03:23.380> fold<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.740> back<00:03:23.860> up<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.490> go<00:03:24.640> back

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
out and just fold it back up to go back

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.850
