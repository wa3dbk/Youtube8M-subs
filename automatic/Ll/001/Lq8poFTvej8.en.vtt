00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Good day to all with you crow 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 and this is the 6th podcast in this podcast again 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 let's talk about freerunning story online 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.980
 Well, some of my personal plans for 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 the next couple of months somehow recently I 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.389
 thought about what we have in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 the result is a game in which players can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.480
 practice parkour compete 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 create clans 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.970
 but it seemed to me that something was not here 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 enough up a game of this type can 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 get interesting for connoisseurs 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.300
 parkour but we are unlikely to be able to attract 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.500
 people who have no idea about 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
 tom what it is 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.719
 Take for example the frank game, say 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.600
 right she obviously was not popular and not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.300
 it will be such that it plays true 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 connoisseurs of parkour and freen they know about 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.250
 than this game they understand the elements 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 and so on and now take for example 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 assassin's creed this game has become possible 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 say cult 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 she knows almost all of this game 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 absorbed a lot of genres 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.789
 This is a historical game this game battles 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.730
 and spies and it also has considerable 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.989
 Parkour share I understood one thing by one 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.240
 Parkour will not be full 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.310
 and if we make a game about parkour and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.159
 nothing more we spend time 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.670
 wasted on discussed this issue with 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.380
 daimon 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.259
 and came to the conclusion that we need 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.659
 rework into the core concept 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 add a few new genres but 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.360
 do this so that they are intertwined 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
 between themselves 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 were closely related we remembered 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.070
 that many of you love to shoot 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.939
 thought about some technical 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 support difficulties 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 game world namely control 1000 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.080
 MHz 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.450
 that is, garage cars and so on 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.210
 the main solution we now see 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.880
 make a zombie apocalypse on the island 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.320
 This of course is trite enough but if 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 approach this idea with a share 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.700
 originality you can get great 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.650
 product is also planned introduction 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 cold and firearms 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.000
 although the latter will be very difficult 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 get parkour will play here 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.080
 The important role of zombies will be over 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.580
 abilities that allow them 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.270
 chase you over the rooftops 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.560
 so easy you won't leave but not only 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 zombies will cause use 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.830
 parkour 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.410
 players that is a resident of this city 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.050
 it will be necessary to get food that will 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.270
 not easy for that they will 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.580
 use the park will get settled 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.290
 no hunger games where our 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.750
 players will need parkour skills 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.910
 to beat rivals get 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 Grand Prize 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.500
 most likely one of the game trailers and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.360
 will be her backstory from where 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.970
 took this zombie apocalypse why 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.700
 people resorted to parkour on now about 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.900
 technical part a bit before 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.330
 time we planned to use 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.430
 render engine is the same on which 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.380
 based gta san andreas but he 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.810
 old enough to forget about him and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.910
 create a game on a new engine rather 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.019
 in total we will use a bunch 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.050
 free engines 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.150
 ogre 3d and bullet physics and of course 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.940
 can not be said about the dates associated with 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.070
 the release of the trailer of the game for either 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.780
 it's no secret that we have many times 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.230
 mistakenly assumed the release date 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.110
 game trailer this time we won't 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.330
 make no assumptions because 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.760
 it turns out so first you ask 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.880
 release date we are trying you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.900
 satisfy we make assumptions on 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.320
 basis of some abstract data but then 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.610
 something goes wrong as we conceived and 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.890
 deadline nothing comes out a 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.280
 then you take offense at us so I 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.470
 I repeat no more assumptions 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.019
 think what you want to guess and how you want 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.720
 but no dates coming 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.580
 half a year before according to my preliminary 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.600
 calculations the game will not work earlier than after 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.000
 half a year 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.040
 does not mean that the game will be released in six months 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.590
 from means that she will come out more than 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 in half a year but nothing concrete we 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.270
 while we can not say the development of the game 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.820
 conducted essentially from scratch and the team we have 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.640
 small and everyone works for the interests of not 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.320
 for money 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.320
 Now I would like to talk a little about 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.360
 our personal plans while we are with all 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.340
 teams think over the concept of the game I decided 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.680
 do other things not related to 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.000
 I have enough project person 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 versatile 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.470
 I canâ€™t do it all the time 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.020
 I plan to update soon 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.830
 their mods such as first person view 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:26.740
 and m hunt also i would like to release a number 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.010
 hunting related mods can be made 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.400
 bow crossbow animals in the forest and on the meadows and 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.800
 so on will also need to do 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.290
 studying the work of the engines on which we 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.080
 we would like to create a game 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.620
 remove machinima in memory of the dead field 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.430
 walker 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.010
 but that's how it goes well, and I think 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 that this time enough information 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:55.350
 Thank you for your attention with you. 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.350
 was a thief of good luck and see you on yu tuba
