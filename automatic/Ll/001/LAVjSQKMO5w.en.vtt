 I hope all is well today I will present a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.650
 other hallucinating weapon of the arsenal of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.649
 black ops 2 the weapon in question is yours 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.180
 monk the tuma ong and leaves from battle 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.030
 of Native Americans 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.309
 Indians were masters at launching 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.710
 this weapon that has become over time 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.250
 also the symbol of the Vikings in the days 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.800
 our 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.170
 instead it is used to cut the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.630
 little pea to all the known bimbiminkia 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.360
 losi asking videos on mina crafen 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.579
 if he putt this in the nutella 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.579
 terrible ax becomes the equivalent 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.149
 of grenades santex ie sticky 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.980
 contact making it a deadly weapon 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 using toma ong is not easy at all 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.439
 must anticipate the movements of the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 enemy and throw at the right time is 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.640
 a weapon to put on a show 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.020
 but nothing advice did if you want 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.780
 play seriously 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.149
 myself after having launched a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.639
 thousands managed to do only 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.740
 a dozen killings, one of which 

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:25.189
 spectacular that I will show you between 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.469
 very little then recapping is 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.969
 a weapon that kills with one shot is 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.399
 fast to launch 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.100
 but unfortunately not in range and much 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.950
 often bounces off the walls to fuck 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.319
 of dog in fact all the shots 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.859
 spectacular that you see on the internet 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.380
 they are the result of the pure and simple ass ok 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:48.020
 now that we have explained how it works 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.079
 we can move to more total action 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.539
 this time I made a change for you 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.959
 scary music video 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.959

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.490
 a technical opinion with the ongoing sion 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.790

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.919

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.370

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.650

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.590
 atomic fart touches me flees for 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.300
 luck with big money I managed to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.669
 buy me a bunker 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.800
 but let's move on to another topic first 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.580
 to close as many of you already 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.820
 will know Sunday, April 7, 2013 it is 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.960
 the final of the black ops 2 took place 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.150
 championship and 2013 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.490
 in a nutshell the best teams of the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.880
 world challenged each other for victory 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.250
 more total Sunday in the final are 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.060
 arrived two teams that is the lighthouses coeli 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.400
 andrews 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.890
 then I said to myself what better 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.140
 opportunity to learn to play if not 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.789
 witnessing a match between the two teams 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.160
 best in the world 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.800
 I went to the kitchen I made myself one 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.289
 pop corn bowl I returned to 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.169
 room I lay on the bed and I have 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.210
 shouted I want to become a pro not 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.810
 had I ever made love with her 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.539
 mutu was the festival of campers other than i 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.370
 two best teams in the world but to make you 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.640
 to better understand I have prepared one 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.710
 reconstruction of what happened 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.789
 the first thing that catches your eye is that 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.100
 all and I repeat, everyone said in fear 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.900
 in a nutshell they went from the weapon 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.870
 primary to secondary school 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.750
 so without reason of the series we have 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.090
 brain problems help us 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.449
 then the compulsive aim was passed 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.759
 they aimed at one point then another 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.340
 then another one is always more and more 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:07.370
 so even if you make yourself a strip of 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.860
 coca can get to these levels are 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.479
 been two hours admiring emptiness like this 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.180
 uninterruptedly 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.460
 but it's not over here occasionally the 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.819
 devil agent pitted in absurd places 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.069
 that not even I camper stick I have 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.279
 never imagined this is the example 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.800
 of the fake sapling hidden behind the 

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:30.830
 plant and blossoming as if it were not there 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.379
 one tomorrow camp was cheerfully but 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.319
 it's not over here because another round 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:38.779
 another map other camper I have them 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.979
 seen camping in places I didn't know 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.830
 not even exist 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.199
 all we needed was to lay down the rosini board 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.839
 to big money and then it was really the pinnacle 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.449
 of the world camping not to mention the 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:53.629
 the jumps they did seemed to play at 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:56.330
 unreal tournament jumped like rabbits 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.550
 shit then another thing that is me 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.039
 remained etched in the brain is the 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.349
 automatic turret whenever 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.779
 arrived at the series of points for 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.360
 they could always position it 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.110
 in this fucking corner of the field from 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.839
 basketball 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.979
 if you think he is telling you a 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.229
 pile of crap 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.629
 go and see the video of the 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.060
 final and you will see that everything I have there 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:22.759
 told it really happened 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.370
 I must, however, compliment everyone and 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:28.249
 two teams because they came up 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.620
 in the end in perfect equality anyway 

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:33.379
 to conclude the next child of 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.259
 trout that will call me camper the lawsuit 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:38.120
 since the best teams in the world camp 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.819
 were I am a pro player of the 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.699
 madonna and that is all 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:47.649
 now I greet you because life is short 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.649
 hello to all merdone soon
