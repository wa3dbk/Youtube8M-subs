00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
bubble ball actually special bow that I

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.069 
bubble ball actually special bow that I
have<00:00:31.630> that<00:00:32.200> um<00:00:32.410> creates<00:00:33.250> bubbles<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:34.079> most

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
have that um creates bubbles and most

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.709 
have that um creates bubbles and most
lizards<00:00:35.469> don't<00:00:36.309> know<00:00:36.519> where<00:00:37.059> the<00:00:37.180> water<00:00:37.390> is

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
lizards don't know where the water is

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.840 
lizards don't know where the water is
because<00:00:38.289> they<00:00:38.440> can't<00:00:38.649> really<00:00:39.039> see<00:00:39.309> him<00:00:39.430> see

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
because they can't really see him see

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.619 
because they can't really see him see
any<00:00:39.969> movement<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.710> bubbles<00:00:42.039> help<00:00:42.629> show

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
any movement so the bubbles help show

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.500 
any movement so the bubbles help show
