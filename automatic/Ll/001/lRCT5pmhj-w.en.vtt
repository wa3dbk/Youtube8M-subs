00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.569
 we are going to prepare onion soup 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.719
 gratin the ingredients that 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.790
 we need are 4 or 5 sweet onions 2 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.389
 garlic cloves 30 grams of butter 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.430
 a heaping tablespoon of wheat flour 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.280
 150 milliliters of brandy or wine cognac 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.530
 white a liter of chicken broth cheese 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.430
 grated slices of toasted bread 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.400
 lightly pepper oil and salt and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.480
 let's start first of all 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 cutting in our julienne onion 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.790
 the finest we can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 when we have them all cut we go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.220
 to take a deep pot and we're going to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.130
 place our butter cube with 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.080
 the onions we are going to add a 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.150
 little olive oil in 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.100
 replacement of the amount of 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.400
 butter that carries the original recipe 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 which for me is excessive and we are going to put 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 the 2 garlic cloves well minced 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 we put a little salt so that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 start to poach and sweat faster and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 we are going to support very very very 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 Little thing is about not getting brown but 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.550
 it is as tender as possible 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.130
 onion 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 if we want we can help ourselves from the top 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.200
 that will make her sweat a lot more we will have 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.320
 to be watching from time to time and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 moving it very well we will take around 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 about 20-25 minutes in doing this and not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.560
 we have to be in a hurry because it's the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 most important point of the recipe a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.870
 once it is completely soft and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.870
 pochada let's add the flour 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 we move it well so that it is distributed and not 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.080
 stick 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 and as you can see the onion is almost 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.640
 it looks like a paste we add the cognac let's go 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.659
 to raise the fire a little so that it 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.659
 evaporate alcohol 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.110
 and once it does not smell like alcohol anymore, 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.110
 add the chicken broth 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.819
 let's raise the fire to start 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.640
 to boil and simmer another 20 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.950
 minutes as we are not interested in being 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.630
 reduce to too much the broth the best is 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 that we put the lid back on 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.210
 our pan and we will move it from 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.190
 once in a while 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.090
 so you do not own the flour in the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 background and stick 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.549
 about 20 minutes as I told you to fire 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.730
 slow we'll finish it to try and so 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.569
 so much of seasoning we add a little 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 pepper 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.189
 and a little bit more salt because it 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.730
 it was needed since the onion when posing 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:57.280
 so slowly sweetens a lot 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.370
 and now with the oven on in the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.010
 top part or the grill put going 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.129
 to throw in the bowls to serve a couple 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.250
 of slices of toast and we're going to 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.650
 cover with what generous grated cheese in 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.440
 our emmental cheese case because the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.099
 Gruyere is harder to get and 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.049
 we are going to gratinate them just until 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.470
 that the cheese melts and without the bread 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.010
 burn us 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.650
 just heat up in the oven 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.140
 and ready and have our soup 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.230
 gratinated onion that although you see that it is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.870
 a slightly elaborate dish does not have 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.599
 no difficulty and the final result 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.329
 it is spectacular because the soup remains 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.420
 almost like a very soft mellow cream 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.420
 sweet and of course delicious
