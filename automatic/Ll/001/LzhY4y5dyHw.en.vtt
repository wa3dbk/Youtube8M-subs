he's<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.210> he's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.479> mid-pack<00:01:37.110> closer

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
he's really not he's a mid-pack closer

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.140 
he's really not he's a mid-pack closer
and<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.100> ideal<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> derby<00:01:39.030> that's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and that's ideal in a derby that's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.880

setting<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> pace<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> should<00:01:40.740> be

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
setting up with a pace that should be

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
setting up with a pace that should be
fairly<00:01:41.040> moderate<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:42.000> gets<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.509> run

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
fairly moderate so he gets to first run

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.999 
fairly moderate so he gets to first run
