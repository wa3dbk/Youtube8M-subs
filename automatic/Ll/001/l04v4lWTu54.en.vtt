00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
the components very familiar to me I

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.360 
the components very familiar to me I
didn't<00:06:42.660> see<00:06:42.840> any<00:06:43.220> striking<00:06:44.220> new<00:06:44.820> thing<00:06:45.950> but<00:06:46.950> it

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
didn't see any striking new thing but it

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.030 
didn't see any striking new thing but it
is<00:06:47.430> an<00:06:48.030> addition<00:06:48.540> that<00:06:48.570> you<00:06:48.840> may<00:06:49.290> consider<00:06:49.770> in

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
is an addition that you may consider in

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.580 
is an addition that you may consider in
case<00:06:50.340> you<00:06:50.610> want<00:06:50.880> to<00:06:51.000> play<00:06:51.420> very<00:06:51.810> large<00:06:52.050> battles

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
that you find here but this is probably

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.600

napoleonic incurred

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.650 
napoleonic incurred
nation<00:07:16.380> more<00:07:16.680> than<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:17.220> ancient<00:07:17.850> one<00:07:18.060> which

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
nation more than the ancient one which

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.710 
nation more than the ancient one which
is<00:07:18.780> great<00:07:19.050> but<00:07:19.410> this<00:07:19.650> one<00:07:19.950> just<00:07:20.370> as<00:07:20.730> abandoned

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
is great but this one just as abandoned

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.740 
is great but this one just as abandoned
has<00:07:21.930> a<00:07:21.960> little<00:07:22.500> something<00:07:23.010> more<00:07:23.250> than<00:07:23.520> the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 
has a little something more than the

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.350 
has a little something more than the
ancient<00:07:24.750> version<00:07:25.730> I'm<00:07:26.730> not<00:07:27.000> going<00:07:27.180> to<00:07:27.270> talk

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
ancient version I'm not going to talk

about<00:07:27.510> gameplay<00:07:27.840> in<00:07:28.020> this<00:07:28.169> video<00:07:28.440> there<00:07:28.650> is<00:07:28.680> a

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
about gameplay in this video there is a

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.129 
about gameplay in this video there is a
video<00:07:29.160> that<00:07:29.400> I<00:07:29.550> feel<00:07:30.150> for<00:07:30.360> that<00:07:30.389> you<00:07:30.720> can<00:07:30.900> watch

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 
video that I feel for that you can watch

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.280 
video that I feel for that you can watch
that<00:07:31.470> video<00:07:31.830> but<00:07:32.550> if<00:07:33.000> you<00:07:33.300> think<00:07:33.570> the<00:07:33.690> game<00:07:33.930> may

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
that video but if you think the game may

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.500 
that video but if you think the game may
be<00:07:34.320> one<00:07:34.680> for<00:07:34.950> you<00:07:35.130> I<00:07:35.160> think<00:07:35.669> now<00:07:35.910> here<00:07:36.389> you<00:07:36.480> have

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510 
be one for you I think now here you have

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.420 
be one for you I think now here you have
a<00:07:36.660> great<00:07:37.020> opportunity<00:07:37.169> to<00:07:37.889> grab<00:07:38.160> your<00:07:38.280> own

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
a great opportunity to grab your own

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.030 
a great opportunity to grab your own
copy<00:07:38.760> the<00:07:39.540> components<00:07:40.169> still<00:07:40.380> look<00:07:40.650> great

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
copy the components still look great

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.270 
copy the components still look great
like<00:07:41.310> it<00:07:41.490> did<00:07:41.639> before<00:07:41.900> gameplay<00:07:42.900> is<00:07:43.169> solid<00:07:43.800> I

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
like it did before gameplay is solid I

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.730 
like it did before gameplay is solid I
need<00:07:44.760> to<00:07:45.000> look<00:07:45.240> have<00:07:45.810> a<00:07:45.840> look<00:07:46.020> at<00:07:46.200> the<00:07:46.320> errata

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 
need to look have a look at the errata

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.370 
need to look have a look at the errata
and<00:07:47.160> I<00:07:48.000> think<00:07:48.210> that<00:07:48.360> that<00:07:48.570> of<00:07:48.750> course<00:07:49.020> can<00:07:49.290> only

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 
and I think that that of course can only

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.680 
and I think that that of course can only
improve<00:07:50.340> the<00:07:50.610> experience<00:07:51.120> with<00:07:51.330> the<00:07:51.479> game

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
improve the experience with the game

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.830 
improve the experience with the game
great<00:07:52.440> game<00:07:52.550> great<00:07:53.550> components<00:07:54.330> I'm<00:07:54.450> glad

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 
great game great components I'm glad

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.300 
great game great components I'm glad
