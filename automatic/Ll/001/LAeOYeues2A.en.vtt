00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
are two chord patterns that is it and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.050

it's lovely
okay<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.570> um<00:02:28.110> yes<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.310> what<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.760> do<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
okay so um yes so what you do so the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.960 
okay so um yes so what you do so the
first<00:02:30.600> chord<00:02:30.930> pattern<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.190> verse<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
first chord pattern is for the verse and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.910 
first chord pattern is for the verse and
the<00:02:33.090> chorus<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:34.350> say<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> intro

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the chorus and I would say for the intro

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
the chorus and I would say for the intro
but<00:02:35.070> there's<00:02:35.220> no<00:02:35.280> intro<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:35.850> if<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.060> wanted

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
but there's no intro but if you wanted

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.880 
but there's no intro but if you wanted
to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.600> an<00:02:36.690> intro<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> core

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
to do an intro this will be the core

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.030 
to do an intro this will be the core
pattern<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.030> you've<00:02:39.150> got<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.830> an<00:02:40.830> E

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
pattern for it so you've got to see an E

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.540 
pattern for it so you've got to see an E
minor<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.810> minor<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:44.010> an<00:02:44.550> F<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.680> C<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.370> minor

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
minor and a minor and an F so C a minor

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.450 
minor and a minor and an F so C a minor
a<00:02:48.060> minor<00:02:48.330> F<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.100> hold<00:02:50.220> each

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
a minor F what you do is you hold each

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.670 
a minor F what you do is you hold each
of<00:02:50.640> those<00:02:50.730> chords<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.390> eight<00:02:51.630> beats<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.470> eight

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
of those chords for eight beats so eight

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.710 
of those chords for eight beats so eight
beats<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.070> two<00:02:53.220> bars<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.300> means<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
beats is two bars so what that means you

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.990 
beats is two bars so what that means you
have<00:02:54.930> 1<00:02:55.800> 2<00:02:56.340> 3<00:02:56.370> 4<00:02:57.210> 2<00:02:57.840> 2<00:02:57.870> 3<00:02:58.410> 4<00:02:58.920> 3<00:02:59.600> 3<00:03:00.600> 4<00:03:00.750> 4<00:03:01.110> 2<00:03:01.560> 3<00:03:02.520> 4<00:03:02.850> we

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
have 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 3 4 4 2 3 4 we

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.980 
have 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 3 4 4 2 3 4 we
get<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.330> general<00:03:03.660> idea

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
get the general idea

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.510 
get the general idea
hopefully<00:03:05.210> let's<00:03:06.210> go<00:03:06.420> down<00:03:07.100> 3<00:03:08.100> 4<00:03:08.310> 3<00:03:08.880> 3<00:03:09.660> 4<00:03:09.950> ok<00:03:10.950> so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
hopefully let's go down 3 4 3 3 4 ok so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.080 
hopefully let's go down 3 4 3 3 4 ok so
um

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
um

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.930 
um
strumming<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.510> unless<00:03:13.250> well<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.700> first

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
strumming that unless well in the first

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.600 
strumming that unless well in the first
verse<00:03:15.780> um<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.770> don't<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.460> got

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
verse um I don't know it's kind of got

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
three times I think and then the last

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.610 
three times I think and then the last
one<00:05:40.710> all<00:05:41.069> it<00:05:41.280> is<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:42.180> you<00:05:42.240> just<00:05:42.389> hold<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.840> G<00:05:42.990> so
