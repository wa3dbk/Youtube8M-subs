remember in 13 years here so for

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
remember in 13 years here so for
starters<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.619> thought<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.369> didn't<00:00:29.760> tackle

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
starters I thought they didn't tackle

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540 
starters I thought they didn't tackle
badly<00:00:30.750> Sark<00:00:31.019> said<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.949> could<00:00:32.130> tell<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.430> their

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
badly Sark said he could tell was their

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.819 
badly Sark said he could tell was their
first<00:00:32.759> day<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.120> maybe<00:00:33.329> little<00:00:34.320> sloppier<00:00:34.770> than

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
first day and maybe little sloppier than

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.340 
first day and maybe little sloppier than
he<00:00:35.040> wanted<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.899> thought<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> was

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
he wanted to be I just I thought it was

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
he wanted to be I just I thought it was
pretty<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> first<00:00:37.920> day<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.489> there

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
pretty good for the first day out there

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
pretty good for the first day out there
tackling<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> thought<00:00:40.110> thought<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.649> did<00:00:40.800> free

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
tackling I thought thought they did free

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.490 
tackling I thought thought they did free
good<00:00:41.129> job<00:00:41.450> not<00:00:42.450> completely<00:00:42.930> realistic

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
good job not completely realistic

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
good job not completely realistic
because<00:00:43.860> neither<00:00:44.700> buck<00:00:44.969> Allen<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.510> ty<00:00:45.690> Isaac

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
because neither buck Allen or ty Isaac

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
because neither buck Allen or ty Isaac
was<00:00:46.410> able<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.340> essentially<00:00:48.000> Trey<00:00:48.210> man

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
was able to go so essentially Trey man

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
was able to go so essentially Trey man

capable yet we didn't see so much either
so<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:09.090> without<00:01:09.210> soma<00:01:09.600> ty

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so you basically going without soma ty

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
so you basically going without soma ty

really improved his his just feeling of

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.559 
really improved his his just feeling of
certainty<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.519> his<00:03:06.700> ability<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.239> do<00:03:07.390> what

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569

perspective today I got to sit up in the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.039 
perspective today I got to sit up in the
stands<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.310> kind<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.519> watch<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:16.120> new<00:03:16.360> new

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
look defense anything stand out to you I

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.080 
look defense anything stand out to you I
do<00:03:20.470> think<00:03:20.799> they<00:03:20.920> know<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.280> better<00:03:21.459> already<00:03:21.760> i

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
do think they know it better already i

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.670 
do think they know it better already i
mean<00:03:22.329> i<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.720> are<00:03:22.810> way<00:03:22.989> ahead<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.290> way

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
mean i think there are way ahead of way

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.590 
mean i think there are way ahead of way
ahead<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.980> where<00:03:24.100> they<00:03:24.340> were<00:03:24.400> last<00:03:24.790> year<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.480> i

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
ahead of where they were last year and i

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.560 
ahead of where they were last year and i
think<00:03:25.810> that's<00:03:25.989> because<00:03:26.140> they<00:03:26.530> tailored<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
think that's because they tailored it to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.330 
think that's because they tailored it to
not<00:03:28.570> be<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:29.170> know<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> tremendous<00:03:29.769> change<00:03:30.070> from

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
not be you know a tremendous change from

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.289 
not be you know a tremendous change from
last<00:03:30.370> year<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:30.790> think<00:03:30.820> they've<00:03:31.120> taken

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
last year i think they've taken

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.300 
last year i think they've taken
advantage<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.709> know<00:03:32.799> what<00:03:32.980> they<00:03:33.130> all

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
advantage of you know what they all

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.180 
advantage of you know what they all
could<00:03:33.579> do<00:03:33.730> i<00:03:33.940> think<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.720> flip<00:03:35.560> side<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.980> thing

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
could do i think the flip side the thing

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.620 
could do i think the flip side the thing
