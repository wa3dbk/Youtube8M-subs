00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hello dear subscribers 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.540
 they asked me to sort it out 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.340
 such a song is a rose rose yard or 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.119
 some kind there 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.119
 Khans and performed means principle 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.990
 what I want 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 well let's start with chords perhaps yes 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.290
 from the original ones he plays on it 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.440
 video or this song can credit for songs 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.020
 attached to the video now i will only 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 show you specific chords 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 which I picked myself will play 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 sets 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 or rather not play and show 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 I will show slowly to be 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.340
 sure what would be clear mean 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 the intro starts with a chord in a minor 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.260
 we will continue to put it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.180
 and put here is not particularly convenient though 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.930
 game and home on let's do our 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.310
 the friend will simply be the first of us 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.790
 level to be clear to her later 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 chord g and again some names 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.759
 you can play here you can talk 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.509
 about how convenient it is, look it up 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.509
 will be something like this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.380
 and the example further caught in the world 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.689
 turn it around 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.470
 and the early rose she was i run out 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.520
 he is there I do not remember how that is how 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.409
 the verse is played first I lose then 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.830
 He said overhead, respectively, too 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830
 look 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.959
 I apologize for the mistakes a little 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.890
 I forgot I do not remember what it means 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.770
 being played means does it start with a minor 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.780
 i don't know i just play like that 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.280
 fundamentally begins all the goals of the minor 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.980
 i.e., mr. 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:49.569
 my house to like 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.569
 a lot of interpretation ashim 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.000
 many emu-land in my 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:16.890
 david hands begin whether he is lifting 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.890
 interesting things to take here again 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.630
 Well, in principle, all if that loss is top 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.870
 Well, in principle, all if there are any 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.820
 questions please just this video 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.410
 it was a quick fix if anyone 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:03.820
 write something incomprehensible comment 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.900
 I will tell you more and more in detail 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.900
 good luck
