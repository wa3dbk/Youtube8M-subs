hands today reinforce the easy part of
the<00:00:15.360> wing<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:17.460> high<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.730> their<00:00:17.910> back<00:00:18.060> today

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the wing the high of their back today

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.230 
the wing the high of their back today
we're<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.410> wing<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.520> 3d<00:00:20.970> plane

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
we're here with a wing from a 3d plane

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.960 
we're here with a wing from a 3d plane
and<00:00:21.510> these<00:00:22.320> things<00:00:22.650> typically<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.490> huge

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and these things typically all have huge

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.300 
and these things typically all have huge
ailerons<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:25.109> which<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.650> kind<00:00:26.160> of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
ailerons in the back which are kind of

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.120 
ailerons in the back which are kind of
floppy<00:00:26.670> they're<00:00:27.119> made<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> foam<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.109> here's<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
floppy they're made of foam so here's a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
floppy they're made of foam so here's a
way<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.760> protect<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.390> aileron<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
way that you can protect the aileron and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
way that you can protect the aileron and
the<00:00:31.529> back<00:00:31.710> corner<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.369> should<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> have

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the back corner of it should you have

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
the back corner of it should you have
some<00:00:33.360> kind<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> impact<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
some kind of impact like this at the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.479 
some kind of impact like this at the
same<00:00:35.760> time<00:00:36.059> almost<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.290> these<00:00:37.440> planes<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
same time almost all these planes have a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
same time almost all these planes have a
rear<00:00:38.790> edge<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.600> least<00:00:39.660> three

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
rear edge that's at least three

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590 
rear edge that's at least three
millimeters<00:00:40.829> wide<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:41.879> take<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> one

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
millimeters wide so you can take a one

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.160 
millimeters wide so you can take a one
by<00:00:42.809> three<00:00:42.840> easily<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.570> glue<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
by three easily and glue it on to the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.130 
by three easily and glue it on to the
back<00:00:46.320> edge<00:00:46.649> thusly<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:48.329> contact<00:00:48.870> cement

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
back edge thusly with contact cement

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.240 
back edge thusly with contact cement
real<00:00:49.950> easy<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.520> makes<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> thing<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.750> Oh

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
real easy to do makes this thing off Oh

your<00:00:57.270> carbon<00:00:57.629> fiber<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.190> do<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> with

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
your carbon fiber so we do that with

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.599 
your carbon fiber so we do that with
piece<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> sandpaper<00:01:00.829> heavy<00:01:01.829> sandpaper<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
good and you can just hold it down with

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.140 
good and you can just hold it down with
a<00:01:05.220> couple<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.640> fingers<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.979> sand<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.729> so

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
control and then I can just flip it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.380 
control and then I can just flip it
around<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> set<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.360> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
around and do this set and there we are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
around and do this set and there we are
you<00:01:21.869> wonder<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.350> fingers<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.770> black<00:01:23.009> huh

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you wonder how my fingers get black huh

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
you wonder how my fingers get black huh
so<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.759> clean<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.240> strip<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> we're

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so we clean off our strip and we're

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
so we clean off our strip and we're
ready<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> sanded<00:01:27.479> side

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
ready to go so this is the sanded side

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
ready to go so this is the sanded side
this<00:01:28.229> one's<00:01:28.470> shinier<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> glue<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this one's shinier so you can glue the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.569 
this one's shinier so you can glue the
rod<00:01:30.000> or<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.900> edge<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> wing<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:32.369> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
rod or the edge of the wing take your

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.080 
rod or the edge of the wing take your
pick

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
pick

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240 
pick
one<00:01:33.299> thing<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:34.560> guides<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
one thing we use is little guides to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
one thing we use is little guides to
help<00:01:35.400> us<00:01:35.610> keep<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> thing<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
help us keep this thing right on the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.469 
help us keep this thing right on the
edge<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.799> took<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.130> angle<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
edge so I just took an angle off the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
edge so I just took an angle off the
very<00:01:39.780> edge<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:41.009> little<00:01:41.340> pieces<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> wood

very edge of these little pieces of wood

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
very edge of these little pieces of wood
and<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.869> clamp<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> have

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and you can clamp them on if you have

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.740 
and you can clamp them on if you have
little<00:01:44.490> clamps<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> won't<00:01:45.270> squish<00:01:45.600> your

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
little clamps that won't squish your

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.410 
little clamps that won't squish your
foam<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.320> tape<00:01:46.649> them<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.909> something<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760 
off while you're working on it right put
one<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.700> each<00:01:53.820> end<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.350> ready<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
one on each end and now we're ready to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.490 
one on each end and now we're ready to
go<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.969> need<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> glue<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.990> then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
go so we need to glue this and then

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
go so we need to glue this and then
transfer<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> glue<00:01:59.369> from<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.719> one

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
transfer the glue from this to this one

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.499 
transfer the glue from this to this one
side<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> other<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.189> make<00:02:02.700> handles<00:02:03.270> for

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
side to the other to make handles for

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
side to the other to make handles for
this<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.869> baby<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> piece

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this little baby you just take a piece

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.190 
this little baby you just take a piece
of<00:02:05.100> tape<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:06.149> fold<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> over<00:02:06.810> leaving

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of tape and then fold it over leaving

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.830 
of tape and then fold it over leaving
three<00:02:08.069> millimeters<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> exposed<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
three millimeters of it exposed at the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.710 
three millimeters of it exposed at the
end<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.700> gets<00:02:12.030> stuck

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
end and then that gets stuck

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.830 
end and then that gets stuck
on<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> rod<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.850> handle<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:15.690> my

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
on to the rod so now I have handle on my

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.590 
on to the rod so now I have handle on my
shiny<00:02:16.080> side<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.670> glue<00:02:17.880> side<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
shiny side and this is my glue side to

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.150 
shiny side and this is my glue side to
get<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> glue<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> tape<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.530> down<00:02:19.590> next<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
get the glue on I tape this down next to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580 
get the glue on I tape this down next to
a<00:02:20.220> straight<00:02:20.550> edge<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.270> use<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.810> run

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
a straight edge so I can use it to run

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.650 
a straight edge so I can use it to run
my<00:02:22.950> finger<00:02:23.430> down<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.450> guide<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.660> apply

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
my finger down as a guide and then apply

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.240 
my finger down as a guide and then apply
a<00:02:28.110> bead<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:29.130> glue<00:02:29.190> evenly<00:02:31.820> down<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.600> rod<00:02:34.250> I'm

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
a bead of glue evenly down the rod I'm

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.580 
a bead of glue evenly down the rod I'm
checking<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.450> much<00:02:36.720> glue<00:02:36.990> is<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.170> there

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
checking out how much glue is on there

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860 
checking out how much glue is on there
in<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.040> reflection<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.330> sure<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
in the reflection to make sure that I

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.270 
in the reflection to make sure that I
have<00:02:40.140> an<00:02:40.320> even<00:02:40.800> bead<00:02:41.720> going<00:02:42.720> down<00:02:43.280> probably

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
have an even bead going down probably

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.010 
have an even bead going down probably
better<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.580> go<00:02:44.820> away<00:02:44.970> from<00:02:45.360> yourself<00:02:45.540> like

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
better to go away from yourself like

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080 
better to go away from yourself like
this<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.770> see<00:02:46.800> how<00:02:47.190> much<00:02:47.400> glue<00:02:47.730> you're

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
this so you can see how much glue you're

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.850 
this so you can see how much glue you're
leaving<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> rod<00:02:50.900> alright<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.709> have

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
leaving on the rod alright now we have

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.880 
leaving on the rod alright now we have
our<00:02:53.070> glue<00:02:53.310> all<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> way<00:02:53.880> down<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.240> rod<00:02:54.890> we

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
our glue all the way down the rod we

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.110 
our glue all the way down the rod we
pick<00:02:56.130> our<00:02:56.340> rod<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:59.060> we<00:03:00.060> transfer<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.470> glue

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
pick our rod up and we transfer the glue

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.699 
pick our rod up and we transfer the glue
so<00:03:03.120> just<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.690> sure<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.959> get<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> between<00:03:04.410> our

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so just make sure we get it between our

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.890 
so just make sure we get it between our
holders<00:03:05.250> there<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.900> down<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:09.030> guides

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
holders there and down here the guides

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.060 
holders there and down here the guides
it's<00:03:10.350> our<00:03:10.770> spiritual<00:03:11.550> guide<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.180> then<00:03:13.070> it's

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
it's our spiritual guide and then it's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.000 
it's our spiritual guide and then it's
good<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.430> use<00:03:14.610> something<00:03:15.270> like<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.230> cloth<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
good to use something like a cloth to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.449 
good to use something like a cloth to
pick<00:03:17.730> up<00:03:17.880> some<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.540> excess<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
pick up some of that there excess and

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.290 
pick up some of that there excess and
then<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.640> rub<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:23.489> transfer<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> glue

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
then we rub it down to transfer the glue

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.860 
then we rub it down to transfer the glue
from<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.260> onto<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> lane<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:26.970> pick

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
from here onto the lane and then pick

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.680 
from here onto the lane and then pick
your<00:03:27.900> piece<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.739> let<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.790> get<00:03:30.030> tacky

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
your piece up and let the to get tacky

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.100 
your piece up and let the to get tacky
take<00:03:31.200> off<00:03:31.440> any<00:03:31.709> big<00:03:32.670> excess<00:03:33.269> blobs<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.959> are

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.740 
take off any big excess blobs that are
right<00:03:34.380> at<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.530> corners<00:03:35.070> here<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.750> if

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
right at your corners here and if

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.020 
right at your corners here and if
necessary<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.800> can<00:03:37.980> smooth<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.610> out<00:03:38.730> with<00:03:38.790> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
necessary you can smooth it out with a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.070 
necessary you can smooth it out with a
piece<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.300> robbed

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
piece of robbed

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.390 
piece of robbed
the<00:03:40.830> legatus<00:03:42.440> all<00:03:43.440> right<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.860> now<00:03:44.070> we<00:03:44.100> just

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the legatus all right and now we just

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.180 
the legatus all right and now we just
let<00:03:44.519> these<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.880> tacky<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.720> tape<00:03:46.080> okay<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.070> we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
let these get tacky like tape okay so we

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.220 
let these get tacky like tape okay so we
let<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.430> dry<00:03:47.459> my<00:03:47.880> elapsed<00:03:48.180> time<00:03:48.450> was<00:03:48.690> about<00:03:48.930> two

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
let it dry my elapsed time was about two

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.759 
let it dry my elapsed time was about two
minutes<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.940> then<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.720> apply<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.080> now<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.620> have

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
minutes and then we apply it now I have

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.330 
minutes and then we apply it now I have
to<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:52.980> careful<00:03:53.190> because<00:03:53.549> it's<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.450> stay

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
to be careful because it's going to stay

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.420 
to be careful because it's going to stay
where<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.670> first<00:03:56.970> makes<00:03:57.390> contact<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.739> you're

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
where it first makes contact so you're

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.680 
where it first makes contact so you're
not<00:03:59.640> going<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.970> be<00:04:00.030> able<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.239> move<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.570> around

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
not going to be able to move it around

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.100 
not going to be able to move it around
you<00:04:01.260> want<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.519> place

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
you want to get it in the right place

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.290 
you glue that baby on you want to do
this<00:04:46.180> because<00:04:47.170> if<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.920> let<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.280> glue<00:04:48.670> cure

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
this because if you let the glue cure

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.780 
this because if you let the glue cure
it's<00:04:50.050> going<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.620> more<00:04:50.860> difficult<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.670> get

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.820 
it's going to be more difficult to get
off<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.300> this<00:04:52.960> will<00:04:53.110> take<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.380> about<00:04:53.500> five
