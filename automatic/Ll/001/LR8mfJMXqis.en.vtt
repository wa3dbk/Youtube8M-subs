00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 well it's all cgt games 45 I hope 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.160
 that you're fine 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.120
 me it's great so we get 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.440
 find for a little bonus video 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.719
 so as you could see in the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.529
 description so that's how drummer 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.880
 so breaking less hungry I think 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029
 that's the question everyone is getting 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 pose but it's how to beat it in htv 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.240
 seven or eight coffins after + hd vnf 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.690
 tell you you can bot very 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.989
 easily so language before 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 start the subject so I do not have 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.870
 changed my name but in the first 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.100
 video I told you it's g games 45 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.030
 and when I created my account is not it 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.969
 that we succeed to already existed 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.000
 so ben I added a tea so there I 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.649
 do not know why I have tilkens 45 himself 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 are maybe a little more put a little 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 better so here we go we'll go 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.100
 inundating so this video has 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.010
 not lasted three hours either so I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.310
 created 40 archer to smash the tesla 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.580
 camouflage at the back who village and him 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.650
 dragon to do the job 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:25.049
 I write also it was one of them sort of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.729
 rage you'll see why this is so that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.579
 the public defense dragons the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.960
 anti - aircraft defenses so here I have 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.800
 a dota tell you I'm still in 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 elite commander and since after that so 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.090
 this is different terror I come from the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.670
 just to make the video I 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.650
 just had the time to create the troops 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.800
 so ben attacked I wanted to remake in 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.040
 live so then had to from the beginning you 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.660
 ask then do your little zoom if you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:06.780
 want two archers then you 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.710
 strafed darche and so here are the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:16.670
 things get on we're happy once 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:23.210
 that this is a spell there a meaning there 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.210
 and dragons madness attack dragon 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.270
 so that's normally the dragons are 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 nickel jobs have blood for blood 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.300
 I do not know if he is insured 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.160
 in any case I hope it's going to make a 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.160
 pretty much the same thing 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.320
 this is going pretty well and then 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.870
 it's won the 100% and alleo so bravo 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.430
 lodge just needed eight dragon so 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 I said that it was more for the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.110
 televie level 7 or 8 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.990
 because I think that level hotels 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.450
 certainly at 7 we can have a very good 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.140
 level 2 or so it is that the hotel of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.330
 vines or eight 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.650
 but well so I showed you how 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.420
 have breaking terror so I 'll do 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.190
 surely after another video for mega 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.040
 house but I do not know yet how 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.970
 that's what I just did 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.550
 in fact so well here it was a little 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.670
 all so that was my second video already 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.090
 so put a green thumb on the video 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.530
 or subscribe if you want for for 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.710

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.870
 special videos on a topic on a 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.610
 other game even if you had to but good to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.870
 each throw still a lot more 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.110
 serious so here's the next bah and to
