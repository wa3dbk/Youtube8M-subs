00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.620
 but of hernán claro and juan manuel 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.900
 lazaneo took they went with a 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.720
 feeling that because from the go 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.240
 it's a more than complicated match 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.860
 feeling of the last 20 minutes I think 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.359
 that if we played him like that 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.640
 we would have complicated a little more 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.820
 how we started playing but good and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.880
 is 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.159
 the technician planned that out there could 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.339
 leave or transform the party and not 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.439
 we're losing everything the same I think 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.090
 deserved triumph of them nothing to 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.560
 we left we say more 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.110
 to go to each player who left everything 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.990
 today could not but good nothing else 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.620
 Hernán respected San too much today 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.900
 lorenzo if it can be I think we had 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.810
 to hold a little longer for 20 minutes 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.910
 the principle that connect with 0 but 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.430
 well we knew that they were a rival 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 complicated and that they were not going to get 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
 and well in the second I do not do a little 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.640
 more as he said with two points that 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.410
 We were what we wanted today 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 and nothing else as he said also that 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.090
 thank each player and all 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 people that came to support the goal 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 early perhaps moved the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 bookshelf inside what they had 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 planned yes of course I do believe that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.080
 if they did not score so early 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 get more complicated as you 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
 he made the 20 minutes first in 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.630
 I think later that we did not know 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.979
 locate on the court but hey the san 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 lorenzo de almagro the last champion of 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 america and we knew that they would have the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.440
 ball they were going to play and play and they were going to 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.009
 insisted so much that there came the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.320
 gol hernán how much it affected the five months 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.630
 without official games of the end of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 federal I saw last year yes the truth 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.530
 that it looked more or less pretty that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.180
 there 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.090
 when coming in competition I think that 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:55.050
 we would have given a little better but good 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.990
 We could do what we knew and good 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.980
 we thank all the people who 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 supports me guys many thanks 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.900
 good trip back and good a dream 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.340
 fulfilled having faced a team 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.560
 of the stature of san lorenzo and more 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 that if the dream in each of those that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 we entered today no one was traveling against a 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.720
 first and good team is already the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720
 soccer thank you very much
