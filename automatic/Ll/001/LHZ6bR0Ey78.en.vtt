00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
is the easiest way to take those old

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.240 
is the easiest way to take those old
clips<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.260> once<00:00:55.260> again<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> pointy

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
clips off once again just got a pointy

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
clips off once again just got a pointy
implement<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> Center<00:00:57.989> tab<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
implement and you see that Center tab in

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
implement and you see that Center tab in
the<00:00:58.530> middle<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> clip<00:00:59.160> punch<00:00:59.850> that

the middle of the clip punch that

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.080 
the middle of the clip punch that
through<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.219> now<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> clip<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:02.699> come<00:01:02.850> right

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
through and now the clip will come right

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
through and now the clip will come right
off

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
off

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.789 
off
that's<00:01:03.510> basically<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.019> holds<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> clip<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that's basically what holds the clip on

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's basically what holds the clip on
is<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.309> center<00:01:05.610> tab<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> spreads<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is that little center tab it spreads the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.250 
is that little center tab it spreads the
teeth<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.909> here's<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.210> old<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:10.020> black

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
teeth and here's some old some black

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.600 
teeth and here's some old some black
some<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.920> black<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.189> white<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
some of these are black or white but

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
some of these are black or white but
again<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> cannot<00:01:12.689> reuse<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.290> old<00:01:13.320> clips

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
again you cannot reuse the old clips

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
again you cannot reuse the old clips
because<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> end<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.760> clip<00:01:15.180> there's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
because on the end of that clip there's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.420 
because on the end of that clip there's
these<00:01:15.869> teeth<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.409> hold<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> chrome<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
these teeth that hold the chrome on and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
these teeth that hold the chrome on and
once<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> pull<00:01:18.150> off<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> old<00:01:18.570> chrome<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
once you pull off the old chrome you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
once you pull off the old chrome you
break<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> teeth<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> buy<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> bag

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
break off the teeth so you can buy a bag

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
break off the teeth so you can buy a bag
of<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.509> clips<00:01:21.900> there's<00:01:22.170> usually<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.710> 100

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
of these clips there's usually about 100

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
of these clips there's usually about 100
in<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.340> bag<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
in a bag or so and you see there's that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.380 
in a bag or so and you see there's that
tab<00:01:25.290> again<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.100> punched<00:01:26.400> flat

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
tab again it's got to get punched flat

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170 
tab again it's got to get punched flat
in<00:01:28.020> order<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> clip<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> stay<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> many

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
in order for the clip to stay on many

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
in order for the clip to stay on many
people<00:01:30.420> cut<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.409> not

the door so what you have to do is get
yourself<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.820> reamer<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
yourself like a little reamer like this

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
yourself like a little reamer like this
and<00:02:03.869> ream<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.590> slightly<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.549> take<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and ream it's slightly just to take a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
and ream it's slightly just to take a
little<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> paint<00:02:06.600> off<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.500> don't

little bit of the paint off you don't
want<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.860> too<00:02:07.920> much<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.550> don't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
want to go too much because you don't

without much effort the clip will go in

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.589 
without much effort the clip will go in
with<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.180> couple<00:02:48.269> taps<00:02:50.359> hammering<00:02:51.359> it<00:02:51.480> in
