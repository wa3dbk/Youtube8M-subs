00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.540
 and 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.830
 so 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.100
 or the table in aggravated integra 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.830
 Welcome to tutorial number 12 for the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.260
 Mayan 2012 program brought to you from 3d 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 I facilitate dotcom on this occasion 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 to learn how to wear masks 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 selection in this tutorial we were 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.400
 working on the outside of a car and 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.900
 you have to call them bioma 45.9 car and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 a base to download from the link in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.850
 the tutorial and before entering what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.630
 is the part of the selection masks 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 I want you to see this look like here 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.270
 I have multiple layers that help me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.699
 to keep all my project organized 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.489
 well for example if I want right now 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.309
 only work on my tires 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.500
 I simply make invisible all 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.500
 the other objects all more layers 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.839
 and I start working with my teeth ok 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 this explains me in a previous tutorial 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.990
 I hope you've seen me but see it 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.930
 because it is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 let's explain what happens tomorrow 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.460
 it really is very easy 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.110
 there are some cases where this 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.600
 and if it's not going to be full of 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 objects or is not full of objects 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.640
 but then they are going to see objects in the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.730
 that I will be able to access or be able to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.380
 select them very hard here by 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.160
 example this car is built of 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.890
 three things that are subdivisions 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.720
 polygons and knots that are mostly 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.400
 polygons 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.070
 but good here in this example I'm going to 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.160
 try to select this roof this 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.680
 We're not like this little arrow 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.170
 let's see that there are three options the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.940
 first is let's teach we 're going to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.500
 select guandique shop 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.660
 and that means you can not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.660
 select or any kind of committing 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.440
 on stage 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.050
 if here to the gic are all types of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.400
 allowed they are going to be selectable there 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.440
 a third option that allows us 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.470
 save it to denzel we had already seen 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.230
 previous previous that was the chef and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.780
 that we could then insert our 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.080
 own tools and sections here 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 same 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.610
 in this case, well, I was going to tell them 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.370
 try to select the right that are 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.370
 we just leave here 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.319
 and see how they show me the types 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.900
 of I committed that there are new polygons 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.170
 subdivisions we are going to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.390
 there are two ways of doing it we are giving a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.269
 one click 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.390
 doing this here I collapsed to 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.280
 everything and then I had already selected in this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.750
 case the loops do my picture of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.019
 selection 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.239
 look like always here they are only 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.180
 selecting what is the ceiling the 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.510
 roof is made of clouds 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.079
 if I try to select now the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.079
 polygons 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.800
 are many the truth are mostly 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.090
 facts did not tell you the car of 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.590
 polygons 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.590
 some are subdivisions 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.069
 about visions 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.230
 Y 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.460
 arise the subdivisions that have my 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.170
 car 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.280
 yes 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.420
 and will even arise in this case 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.420
 because they also have curves 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.390
 be all or only we are going to put 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.390
 curves 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.030
 the curves 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.940
 tell me how it moves 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.840
 and surfaces in cloud type 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.840
 all whole 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.580
 and this curve that was created when I 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.620
 this 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.980
 yes, look how it is interacting 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.980
 here 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.470
 this curve was created when I made a 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.080
 bridge bridge is a union between two 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.370
 polygonal parts is good here in this 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.370
 case they are from their divisions 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:34.470
 as I say they are very useful for truth 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.050
 a selection 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.340
 then in this case for example I 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.370
 want to select the curves 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.150
 I do not know from here 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.900
 just do me with extraction 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.920
 if the selection and even without seeing this 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.920
 part was selected 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.880
 but they are very useful 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.220
 if you're working on projects very 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.770
 complexes I recommend for you 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.470
 you can select an object that you want 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.880
 see or what you want to avoid with which the 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.870
 selection we're practically going to be able 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.000
 select 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.000
 any kind of will allow us 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.770
 we want are for example curved jones 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.810
 type of surfaces that are knots 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.810
 polygons flat subdivisions 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.220
 particles and so on 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.840
 to finish with what are the 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.840
 preselections had told you that 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.960
 we can add this kind of vision to 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.590
 be 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.389
 and for example we're going to put everything on 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.080
 and if I am going to want only 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.360
 select the loops 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.590
 let's check this option 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.409
 we are not going to oils ok here is already what 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.259
 what is this type of selection now 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:55.289
 we will have everything in homs 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:58.020
 and if you tighten this look how all 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.129
 these types of geometries disappear 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.949
 to only leave me with loops 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.490
 God, I will be able to select the 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.960
 not in s 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.729
 I hope you have fun 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.410
 learning the following are waiting for you 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.449
 tutorials for the program May 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.289
 2012 among them to you alone since 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.289
 facilitated dotcom
