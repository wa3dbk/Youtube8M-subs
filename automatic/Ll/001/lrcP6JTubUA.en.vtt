00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.869
 Good day, the workshop welcomes you 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.570
 Jed today we get to know the tape 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.220
 sawing machine for wood and metal 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 g 8201 to he also has a performance for 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.750
 three phases called g80 203 to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.000
 extremely interesting machine analogues 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.280
 which is probably not our market it 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.559
 designed for sawing like wood so 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 and metal for doing so 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.659
 conflicting tasks machine is equipped 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 gearbox that allows you to change 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:59.760
 speeds of 920 and thousands of meters per second 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.760
 for wood and for metal 1217 2433 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.240
 4360 and 85 meters per minute which 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.580
 allows you to cut material and start 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 slate and finishing high carbon 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.299
 become 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.610
 maximum cutting height 152 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.530
 millimeter when using insert 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.600
 cutting height becomes 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.600
 unrivaled 305 millimeters width 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.220
 kerf 340 millimeters power 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.330
 engine machine 1 point two 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.670
 kilowatt 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.980
 which is enough to do 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 most types of work on this machine 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.550
 length of saw blades two thousand three hundred 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.040
 fifty millimeters wide web in 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.200
 depending on the type of work can be changed 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.480
 from 3 to 20 millimeters and now let's 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.370
 run the machine and look at it in 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.890
 work like when sawing wood so 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.890
 rebuilding it when cutting metal 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.259
 Well, let's not figure skated in this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 load sas 60 millimeters thickness 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.759
 at any width of the belt 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.310
 here sit less ruler 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.239
 nicknames of people and for the sake of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:22.480
 should already be a multiple of moderate 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.670
 drank a clean bar 60 millimeters 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.519
 now we have prepared our machine 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.110
 for sawing metal changed saw 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:37.030
 canvas linen on metal and switched 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.739
 metal gearbox 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.010
 the speed we have is now 80 meters in 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.760
 second set let's try or 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.299
 duralumin 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.650
 billet and when choosing a saw 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.500
 metal canvases 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:55.970
 from need to proceed from the rule more often 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.100
 the tooth is easier to cut and for sheet 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.829
 metal thickness up to two millimeters 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.209
 it is better to choose a cloth teeth 14 as we 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.180
 we see you profile in the Urals 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.180
 surrendered without a fight in front of our machine 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 let us tell you about the little 1 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.560
 tricks and settings of the machine and 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.849
 preparation of the machine to work need special 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.700
 attention given 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.010
 sliding guides top and 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 lower saw units main machine 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.829
 rule to sliding guide 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.470
 carbide were from saw 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.629
 canvas with a gap of 0 1 millimeter 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.260
 field is elementary possible 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:44.859
 check with a sheet of food paper 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.129
 Here we have set up the correct gaps 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.870
 01 millimeters let's deal with 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.000
 scary and first look beast 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.670
 gearbox which stands on this machine 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.220
 he is responsible for changing turns as 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.280
 when sawing wood and when sawing 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.500
 metal now the machine we stand on 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.180
 speed for the front tree 1000 meters 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.659
 per second it means that we have a clutch 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.579
 pressed all the way and introduced into the slots and 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.340
 upper and lower pulleys are located in 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.539
 in order to translate 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.380
 us sawing a tree into 920 meters mode 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:27.400
 second we need to rotate 180 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.039
 degrees these pulleys for cutting metal 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.460
 we need to put in gear 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.720
 which translates into working position 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.530
 by pulling and turning counterclockwise 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.210
 arrows 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.610
 here in this position we have now 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.729
 speeds range from 12 to 80 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.410
 meters second 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.940
 gear gear work in oil and 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.289
 so you need to periodically 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.500
 control level 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.720
 lookout speak no ears for you 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.630
 fast speeds 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.150
 marked high not spears 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.240
 insert to increase the height of the cut 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.250
 pilgrims 8201 includes a whole 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.990
 a set of parts necessary for 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.060
 adjustment machine and small 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.680
 there is even a pleasantness in this kit 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.160
 saw blade for wood for 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.950
 increased cutting height some 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.770
 parts we have under replacement that is 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.600
 there is a rear fencing for replacement saw 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:33.150
 front saw blade and rod 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.710
 adjusting the depth of cut also new 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.330
 bolt 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.070
 increased length in order to 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.970
 fasten the top and bottom of the machine 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.820
 g 8201 machine can take a decent 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.630
 place in your workshop and help in 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.080
 implementation of your ideas and plans 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:59.090
 successful work you creative success 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.090
 good customers and see you soon
