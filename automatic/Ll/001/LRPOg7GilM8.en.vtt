00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 little boy that passes companion but I 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.370
 I think we're all going for a little trick 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.410
 let's flip with the circuit that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 we have here both on the circuit as 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.050
 with the subscribers here subscribers 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:26.010
 these products more than subscribers 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 I want to win do not tell me that I win it 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.920
 that's what I spend the first is those five 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.920
 high I do not tell you that care mate 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.309
 if we do not go crazy 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.410
 and this is crazy 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.800
 I do not think that people more or less 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.680
 I like it 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.790
 beautiful to concentrate on butt 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:19.140
 I'm behind you William and the seventh 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 and coming down from sales like again 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.690
 a whole career of skill and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.740
 speed basically so here 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:33.960
 I'm going to concentrate on the subject and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.910
 they came back I do not know how many doors will be 5 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.400
 55 laps, so I'm going to do it here 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.940
 is doing perfect to come back and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 forward there is enough slipstream every time 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.290
 correct dance type does not look at others 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.680
 of the car said that is his life improves the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.810
 pasta 22 half 2 launched mate 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.660
 many that advanced some points to 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.509
 overtake it forward I've given it a little 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.580
 hand is that I came across avoid the curvita 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.740
 of death here I will want this 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.380
 for me it's worth perfect cut here 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.570
 more than the advancement of speed 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 always a few times high aunt I shit on 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:18.440
 all 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.670
 Maria Gual, the good ones, let it go like this 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.040
 perfect now I understand the race 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.960
 birdies greeting me too and now what 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.230
 I understand host 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.230
 my mother 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:51.560
 to total bullets and to the race thus we 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.190
 lack violence a little transporting 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.190
 for the racc and there 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.990
 but not in time to overtake it at 20 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.390
 advancing positions and also as 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.570
 some invested and the first two the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.760
 I have front damn 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.310
 if I did not have time just arrived 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 even look at the first seconds 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.460
 possible and won two laps plus me 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.380
 I think I got the look from 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.210
 trick and right now fifth I'll leave 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.850
 that all fillings pass I'm going to 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.010
 play that says if you look at you look left 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.370
 there is still room for people to enter with him and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.370
 I want to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.770
 the latter but huh 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.790
 you think that if I stop here in the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.790
 second came the second 3 and the 2 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.959
 has arrived 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:02.379
 the risk we should have given 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.610
 tell before if we had been because 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.780
 Of course, I've discovered how the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.610
 race when we were going round 4 but 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.690
 Of course I jumped, I say, I do not know how 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.730
 people take it well me because I'm 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.049
 hitting some rebounds here but because 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 we carry straight and we have to 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.769
 throw the most by the side in everything is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.769
 let's do the twisting 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.509
 but in the end 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.690
 with the black eye have already started has 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.690
 what to get 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.099
 this said tommy mÃ³ttola once that I've already 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.099
 mounted there is another 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.200
 what the hell this is the maximum of now 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.290
 same I will die of insecure love 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.010
 to see do not show he said he knew not 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.580
 I knew eye eye, I did not come too 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.360
 no strong guy who comes is that 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.360
 will play nothing uncle 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.750
 but as he dies he has not understand why 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.030
 how good Uncle dies me all end there 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:27.300
 again uncle there is another who also 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.300
 in June and if this gave like the time 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.880
 ojito ojito right little left 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.930
 little bit of the middle 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:44.050
 the data does not pick up the deadlock but 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.400
 as it is done instead of tail 30 and with 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.430
 the bike straight so it does not jump so much 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.110
 so that it does not bounce so much will dance me 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.160
 I die that flips active and jumping for 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.160
 down number believe 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.919
 I very much the motorbike 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:08.890
 It's worth it to fuck what a fall 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:15.640
 efe me too 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:15.640
 goodbye 1817 our goal 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.800
 10 seconds 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.960
 you see that if I get to the madness of 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.960
 trunks 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.250
