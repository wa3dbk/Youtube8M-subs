00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.389
 mode it's eliminating algeria and for 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.920
 to do this it will have to win 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.219

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.900
 see aristide bancé 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.880
 balloon and shifted to dance the keystroke 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.410
 is powerful it goes over 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.180
 she covers have extremely 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.590
 interesting there are the capabilities of the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.970
 head in this Algerian team not 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.980
 badly very good players in this area 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.599
 as for the second post daouda diakité 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.489
 can ward off the danger it will come back 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.870
 surface their two balloons extremely 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.870
 dangerous since they hit this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.589
 deviated that will offer a new corner to 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.449
 algeria also know resisted three by 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:47.090
 pitroipa in lax but support 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.930
 suitable for offense brokers 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 perso keeping jonathan pitroipa 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.120
 speed cities and arbitrariness 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.160
 pilati makers 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 touched just before the opponent the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.860
 lamprey he lost not the big bridge 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.129
 the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.770
 he still succeeds 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.770
 succeed the big good ok 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 1 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 it takes 2 2 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.370
 Belkalem 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.050
 ok it 's still thinking that will go 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.450
 to other frager of this training 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.370
 to the part accor and saint pauli who 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.800
 goes the action is not over with the 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.160
 center and the ball cleared by Algeria 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.510
 new luck with the deflected hit 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.810
 incredible compared to his madness that 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.340
 save Algeria and defense 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.500
 Algerian who ends up putting the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.960
 balloon farther he saved his team 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.850
 it's pitroipa that's the most threatening 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840
 the serious support which is the asset the asset 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.770
 offensive number 1 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.570
 a last opportunity maybe his 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 last tens of seconds 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.800
 the center of equality in the fight the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.170
 jonathan goal 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.090
 apa he's good in the cities but he 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.359
 can also score a head 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359
 square 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.270
 to mark this was not the moment of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.000
 penalty it was often inside 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.630
 are often buyers such as 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 stallions of burkina leads 1 0 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.510
 pitroipa just before 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.490
 it was the most serious threat was 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.800
 trump number 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.060
 it is the number 1 asset of Burkina Faso 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.060
 are they very good in the Netherlands trapped 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.239
 Algerians in their backs 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.069
 the attentive ones because first of all it's 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.849
 him who covers and not only she's going 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.560
 see pitroipa 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.990
 he's not watching what's going on in his 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.740
 back 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.740
 already too far 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.180
 3 bat that passes him in front of whoever 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.490
 still surprises must we succeed in the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.020
 put and it is not necessarily obvious 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.470
 even if you are careful when you return from 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.380
 cloakroom 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.790
 a shoah panel surface and balloon captured 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.810
 in two stages by daouda diakité 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.520
 always good balls to solder 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 mines are they are never neutral to these 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120
 centers 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.909
 on this pass with slimani the hook 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.359
 of slimani he a little bit missed the 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.999
 center recessed feghouli of king la 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.499
 strikes sofiane feghouli in this effort 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.920
 that he had who were in the process of 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.930
 float 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.629
 we felt that Algeria had a blow to 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.260
 play and it's done the equalization of 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:28.340
 feghouli a violent departure 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 this pro 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.160
 who at this shock between diakity his player to 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.420
 a heavy consequence because they are 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.430
 in full reorganization is not 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.690
 income on the ground yet to help 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.290
 beautiful and it did not work well 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.390
 watch with 7 passes in the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.930
 important depth than the second bone 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.940
 slimani who mutes mute to leave his 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.160
 memories and drummer full window 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.170
 to spill in a minute that did not 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.430
 quick to clear the ball it makes a 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.800
 another opportunity for Algeria the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.730
 center of the taught darty of diakité 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.530
 who escapes the ball 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.510
 the goal is lively and little heels 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.040
 second chance at this recovery 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.300
 it'll miss the center forever 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.290
 to look for thinking but it's about the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.870
 belkalem's head cum with the little 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 102 to stay in series of place and that 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.109
 misses 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.789
 watch that smile and hit her 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.729
 fly so beautiful that it has wind 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.430
 it was difficult this time the typing 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.949
 of jack 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.830
 hadja knows the early autumn timer 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.229
 winter that succeeds in more formidable is 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.240
 quite unexpected the adjarie is done on 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.370
 me 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.530
 to note 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.240
 goals at the end of the first period on 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.449
 is 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.819
 his football swinging long socks 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.629
 very much appreciated by his good attackers 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.629
 it did not happen 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.230
 it was enough of this breakthrough this 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.449
 perforation 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.969
 the agent gives 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.270
 this will there two djakaridja knows 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.750
 the prince is good others 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.250
 he saw the cab r1 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.020
 it will take on the side of the corner 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.730
 pulled by taylor ready in the head to the 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.410
 mound 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.660
 the equalization of the Algerian team 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.210
 is now at two goals everywhere 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.780
 they are trapped completely on the 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.050
 corner the burkinabè 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.569
 once again the advantage is difficult 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.860
 acquired 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:25.330
 note second goal outside good 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.880
 there was a change 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.920
 but they had the benefit of the camp 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.330
 yesterday so was almost intercepted the 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.330
 knock on the left that's fine 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.830
 this content 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.830
 That's what we did 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.830
 Vailati 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.800
 if this long time 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.400
 explaining that he was turning 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.009
 the surface 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.180
 seems to me to be the case 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.620
 you have to have guts 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.169
