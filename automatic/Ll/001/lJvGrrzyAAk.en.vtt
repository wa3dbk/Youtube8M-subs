00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.770
 third game third you foxes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.050
 fight against fresh up 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.650
 göppingen the next two points of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.720
 season 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 So we gave up the we had 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 ups and downs, of course, after the game 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.059
 the front was clearly back 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.739
 located but we never plugged 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.640
 We have always fought and always struggled 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.320
 believed that we have the two points 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.900
 finally get back home 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.989
 It was expected from the beginning 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.809
 intense duel at eye level with the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.720
 better start for the foxes 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.180
 konstantin igropulo with the 3 1 in the 5 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.829
 minute 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.149
 the Berliners then missed it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.700
 to move further away 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.520
 instead, the guests were getting better and better 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.480
 in just under 15 minutes , it was said 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.220
 3 5 for göppingen 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.460
 but the berliners got this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.290
 momentum immediately back on her side 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.490
 konstantin igropulo ends the 14th 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 0-run to 7 to 5 so up to 15 minutes 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.550
 Everything was fine so we led 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.050
 But then it did not break 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.860
 continuously run the ball 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.540
 when the musicians flew and and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.479
 then came time penalties and also 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.150
 that we do not have 100% chance 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.860
 used and the göppinger used 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 the mistakes or the gaps in 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.830
 the berlin defended and laid 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 turn their back on a 14 0 run 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.159
 with the half-time whistle hit maximilian 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.689
 then even pushes to the first 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.090
 The three-goal lead 9 to 12 was the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.799
 break was 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.479
 Although the guests increased at the beginning of the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.460
 second half on four goals 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.770
 but the foxes did not let themselves 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.280
 Shake off thanks to one 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 towering silvio heinevetter and the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.970
 homeowners found now always front 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.890
 more often the gaps in the aggressive 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.619
 defense of the guests 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.880
 Ivan Nincevic with the 18 to 17 of the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.959
 first tour since the 18 minute 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.610
 but göppingen held against and 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.020
 again, one was played 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 three-goal lead 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.410
 momir ilic 19 22 the episode timeout 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 foxes and trainer dago situation seemed 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.640
 to have said the right thing 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.540
 within seven minutes, they turned 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.090
 foxes the game 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 sven sören christophersen 26 24 now 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.340
 The air seemed to be out at the guests 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.470
 his 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.640
 the berliners took over the lead 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 the time and won at the end of 29 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.500
 26 a hard-won victory of course 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 that there are two different handball 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 culture for ping the image of very trade 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 handball and also very one against one 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.420
 did not emphasize such a collective game as 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.780
 we like to be so because of that is an opponent 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.160
 against us that's how it is always but you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.960
 Of course she gets tired too and if she does 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.100
 you will feel tired because of mistakes 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.080
 then they do not have the collective 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.970
 Players then make the single mistakes 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.590
 we'll get the light balls and the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.130
 same to and therefore we have on 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.610
 won 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 Overall, I'm pretty happy 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.310
 Of course, there are always things we do 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.770
 but can still do better 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 Every year say that we have against 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.950
 played very good team and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.460
 won at home and must be so very 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.690
 be satisfied 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.400
 the other trouble 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.680
 the HSV gets in with a victory 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.090

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.690
