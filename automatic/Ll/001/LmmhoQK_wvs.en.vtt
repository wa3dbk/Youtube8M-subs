00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680
 ah 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.189
 hi all my friends youtube I am 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.200
 alexander aka alex in 77 welcome to 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.810
 this new video tutorial where are we going 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.900
 to learn how to solve the problem 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.030
 of the slow internet in windows 10 if you 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.440
 You are a user who has updated or who 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.629
 has installed windows 10 in your 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.730
 computer and feel that your internet 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.110
 is slower than normal this is the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.449
 video that will help you solve that 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.670
 problem this happens because microsoft has 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.530
 incorporated a new function to what 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.150
 it's windows 10 that we're going to be 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.210
 disabling then stay in this 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.129
 video and we're going to learn how to put 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 normality our internet that's 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.699
 something I want to mention we are not going to 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.650
 speed up the internet in windows 10 but 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.479
 that we are going to normalize the then 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.650
 stay in this video and we will learn 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.030
 a little bit of what is in a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.680
 tool and we're also going to learn to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 how to disable this option so that 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 our internet in windows 10 go back to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.960
 its normal 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.070
 ok friends is the official page in 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.230
 where are we going to find the information 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.150
 detailed what this option is or 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.370
 this new feature that microsoft 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.510
 incorporates windows 10 good in this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.820
 I am going to talk to you 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 own words I will not read them 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.320
 you guys if you want to know much more 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.840
 in detail about what this is 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.610
 new windows 10 function you are going 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.960
 to stop and they will be reading the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.880
 questions here we will find the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.380
 most common questions and also 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.750
 giving electric let's find the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.760
 answers here are the questions 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.050
 most common about this new function and 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.119
 good as I told you guys are going to 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.550
 stop and they will be reading so 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.260
 be much much more aware in this 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.300
 so, as I say, I'm going to 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.770
 explain in my own words what 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.750
 this works good 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.400
 Microsoft has incorporated this new 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.320
 Delivery of updates function 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.750
 this works as follows 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.080
 suppose that within our network of 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.950
 internet there are teams that have 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.810
 updates that our team does not 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 have suppose that my team has 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.650
 some updates that another team 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.500
 near our rule has what it's going to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.890
 be my team or my system is to try 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.690
 search within our internet network 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 The closest they have updates 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.370
 that my system needs it then my 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.050
 system will be dealing with 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.300
 enter other equipment and extract 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.069
 those updates so that's not 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.569
 can install them on our computer and 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.520
 equally other teams are also going to 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.280
 try to enter our system 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.470
 to be able to get updates that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.510
 other equipment does not have this 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 it works as if it were a server 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.290
 in our team as other teams go 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.459
 to try to be our servers 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.560
 team is going to be the server 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.600
 updates that we have and likewise 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.790
 other teams are going to be extracting 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.220
 those updates this is the function 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.110
 or the tool that Microsoft incorporates 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.660
 windows 10 now this what it does is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.850
 limit our band of broad saturate 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.440
 our broadband imagine many 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.480
 systems trying to enter by 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.670
 internet to our team and you're 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.680
 updates as this really 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.440
 saturates our wide band and what 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.510
 does our internet get 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.489
 very slow now what we are going to do is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.080
 deactivate the delivery option of 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.850
 updates for that because we're not going to 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.830
 make our team we go to the 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.530
 start option then we go to the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.490
 configuration option here opens 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.590
 this window 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.240
 we will lead option 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.980
 security updates we are going to 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.410
 click on there then we 're going to 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.090
 the advanced options and here we go 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.050
 to the part of choose the way in which 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.490
 you want the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.710
 updates we are going to give you a click 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.410
 here and as we can see we have 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.630
 this function is active and now we have two 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
 options that we can do the first 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.100
 Well, it would be simply to share 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.350
 these updates within our 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.060
 local network for that we're going to give you a click 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.030
 here where it says computers on the network 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.950
 local good this part works well 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.530
 imagine that we in our house 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.210
 we have three or four teams all 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.220
 equipment that you have greater than one 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.690
 obviously this would be our network of 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.570
 local area we have the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.010
 possibility to share updates 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.050
 within our own local network this 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.390
 would be the function that allows us to do 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.910
 that or if we could not turn it off 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.190
 I totally know the option where 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.739
 completely deactivates that function and so 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.750
 because our broadband would be a bit 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.490
 more free for our internet 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.020
 work much faster I recommend them 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.730
 do this but if you want 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.129
 they can also do the equipment in the 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.749
 local network ok when doing this as a team 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.189
 in the cal arrangement, they are also going 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.899
 to decongest what your band 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.560
 wide in this case I'm going to deactivate 

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:40.780
 totally and we close 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.120
 and so our internet would be to 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.970
 normality as we had it maybe in 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.530
 our previous operating system here 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.480
 ends this video I hope you have them 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.960
 served and they have been a lot 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.340
 utility 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.450
 remember that as always in the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.250
 description of the video I leave the link 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.690
 of the to my social networks especially 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.100
 I recommend you visit my channel 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.930
 funk pension can give you a click on 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.130
 I like you are going to be followers of me 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.720
 fan page and with that they will have the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.639
 advantage of having the notification of 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.470
 All my videos in your profile 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.270
 facebook also remember that this video 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.550
 you liked give it a little hand click 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.990
 and if the video served you subscribe to the 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.729
 channel would also be very important 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.990
 that you could share this video in your 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.580
 social networks so that your friends can 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.160
 also find out what these are 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.360
 new windows 10 functions also 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.280
 remember that at the end of this video 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.870
 they make contracts links a link a 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.540
 insane and I told me earlier video and a 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.760
 link where it leads you to my next 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.740
 video thank you for your attention is 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.180
 socializing the family I send you a very 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.190
 cordial greeting from Cali Colombia and we

 caused
