00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello friends today we will teach you 0 of 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.309
 plastic bags the materials that 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.309
 we need is a plastic bottle 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.970
 let's start cutting it 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.100
 from below the good bottle we started 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 with getting ahead step a little 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.930
 we are going to cut little by little 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:38.719
 until you reach movement 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.719
 it's a bit difficult to work 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.739
 since we saw that we were going to finish 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.879
 we take our scissors and 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.879
 we cut 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.190
 well we have ready and we separated the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.190
 bottom part 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.509
 let's grab her with all the enthusiasm 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.509
 to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.600
 in order to accommodate the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 bags so that when it's done it's the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 first I can take the second one if 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 you need a detector 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.760
 here we make a nice and extreme 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.120
 circulitos 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.910
 that's how we put everything that are 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.340
 sachets the bottom part below we 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.640
 can serve to cover our same 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.610
 bags you can put two punch the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.050
 to have it hanging on a wall 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.050
 and good on the right 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.439
 and you already have the stars you liked 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.229
 the project basically we put the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.759
 plastic bottle with two claritas or 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.820
 two screws in the part of what is 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.330
 the wood you screw and since with 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.940
 our to use it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.410
 part the bag and we throw our 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.470
 bag and we grabbed it from the corner the 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.410
 we go down completely to put it 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 let's grab the tip to the center of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.520
 the other bags that are already 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.240
 we rolled it up in a way that 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.110
 do not stay tight so you have to 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.420
 you can use some bags we cover 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.340
 with the lid or the base under the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 bottle so you do not get any 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.030
 dust and now 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.030
 you need a little bag you take it out 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.740
 the next mouth is left and so 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.740
 successively
