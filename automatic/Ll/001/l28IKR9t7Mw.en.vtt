00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.440 
so this whole thing is yes it is kind of
like<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.020> Wii<00:02:11.290> yes<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.280> does<00:02:12.460> maybe<00:02:12.850> have<00:02:13.210> some

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
like a Wii yes it does maybe have some

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.110 
like a Wii yes it does maybe have some
sort<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:14.020> don't<00:02:14.620> has<00:02:14.860> motion<00:02:15.400> sensors<00:02:15.909> or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
sort of I don't has motion sensors or

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600 
sort of I don't has motion sensors or
whatever<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.659> is<00:02:17.459> over

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
whatever it is over

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
whatever it is over
has<00:02:18.880> 12<00:02:19.210> interactive<00:02:19.750> sports<00:02:20.050> games<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.440> 40

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
has 12 interactive sports games and 40

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 
has 12 interactive sports games and 40
arcade<00:02:21.280> games<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.450> 12<00:02:22.900> games<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
arcade games so you have 12 games that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.670 
arcade games so you have 12 games that
kind<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.740> utilize<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.810> remote<00:02:26.200> kind<00:02:26.590> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
kind of utilize the the remote kind of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.100 
kind of utilize the the remote kind of
like<00:02:26.770> Wii<00:02:27.010> Remote<00:02:27.370> style<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.150> guess<00:02:28.630> maybe<00:02:28.810> does

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
like Wii Remote style I guess maybe does

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.660 
like Wii Remote style I guess maybe does
have<00:02:29.260> some<00:02:29.470> sort<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.770> motion<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.340> we'll<00:02:30.520> have

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
have some sort of motion but we'll have

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.940 
have some sort of motion but we'll have
to<00:02:30.820> take<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> look<00:02:31.240> now<00:02:31.420> has<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:32.050> 48<00:02:32.440> our<00:02:32.740> K

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
to take a look now has just 48 our K

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.890 
to take a look now has just 48 our K
games<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.520> probably<00:02:33.790> hold<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> thing

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
games that you probably hold the thing

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.090 
games that you probably hold the thing
just<00:02:35.020> like<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> regular<00:02:35.500> controller<00:02:36.870> anymore

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
just like a regular controller anymore

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.370 
just like a regular controller anymore
on<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> back<00:02:39.460> there<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.210> got<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.140> whole

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
looks like it's in stereo 2 - that's a

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.920 
looks like it's in stereo 2 - that's a
nice<00:03:11.410> sound<00:03:11.620> for<00:03:12.070> one<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.280> these<00:03:12.340> units

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
nice sound for one of these units

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.720

surprisingly<00:03:13.930> enough<00:03:14.230> does<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.950> say<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.430> part

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730

surprisingly enough does it say the part
it's<00:03:16.330> weird<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.989> says<00:03:17.260> on<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> box

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
