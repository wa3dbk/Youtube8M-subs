right now there are nine of them in
there<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.220> bounce

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.370 
there I think you know they bounce
around<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
