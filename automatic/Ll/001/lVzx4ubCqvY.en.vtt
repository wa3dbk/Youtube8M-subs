00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
you look up the top here you will see a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.870 
you look up the top here you will see a
dial<00:01:02.899> pointing<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.229> whatever<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:05.189> may<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.489> on

dial pointing to whatever it may be on

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
dial pointing to whatever it may be on
your<00:01:06.270> system<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:07.680> now<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.400> style<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
your system right now the style here is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
your system right now the style here is
that<00:01:09.600> my<00:01:09.780> default<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.479> this<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.869> our<00:01:12.990> mains

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
that my default so this is we our mains

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.359 
that my default so this is we our mains
was<00:01:14.100> originally<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.500> block<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> program

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
was originally now to block this program

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
was originally now to block this program
what<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:19.049> nudge<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.619> up

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what you want to do is just nudge it up

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.090 
what you want to do is just nudge it up
a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.369> every<00:01:20.580> single<00:01:21.240> time<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
a little bit every single time and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
a little bit every single time and
you'll<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> dial<00:01:23.670> moving<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.500> keep

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you'll see the dial moving so if we keep

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
you'll see the dial moving so if we keep
going<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:28.549> as<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.540> can

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
going up a little bit more as you can

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.679 
going up a little bit more as you can
see<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.840> jumped<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
see it jumped a little bit up there and

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
see it jumped a little bit up there and
what<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.740> do

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what we want to do is basically just do

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.920 
what we want to do is basically just do
this<00:01:35.340> until<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.329> reach<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.979> dial

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
this until you reach the top of the dial

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.889 
this until you reach the top of the dial
because<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.170> says<00:01:40.880> setting<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:42.479> settings

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
because that says setting some settings

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.830 
because that says setting some settings
on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> motherboard<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> CPU<00:01:46.710> walk

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
on the motherboard to make this CPU walk

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
on the motherboard to make this CPU walk
faster<00:01:48.840> without<00:01:49.380> actually<00:01:49.770> changing<00:01:49.950> any<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
faster without actually changing any of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
faster without actually changing any of
the<00:01:51.020> voltages<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> actual<00:01:52.770> motherboard

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the voltages on the actual motherboard

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.539 
the voltages on the actual motherboard
so<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.430> completely<00:01:53.700> safe<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:55.549> now

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so it's completely safe to do now

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.639 
so it's completely safe to do now
because<00:01:56.670> I've<00:01:56.969> done<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.329> before<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.350> my

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
because I've done this before this is my

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.429 
because I've done this before this is my
maximum<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.090> I've<00:02:00.689> got<00:02:00.719> three<00:02:01.140> thousand

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
maximum here and I've got three thousand

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.760 
maximum here and I've got three thousand
four<00:02:01.619> hundred<00:02:01.680> Omega<00:02:02.640> hilts<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.899> that's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
four hundred Omega hilts so that's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.609 
four hundred Omega hilts so that's
pretty<00:02:04.979> nice<00:02:05.189> aim<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.200> on

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
pretty nice aim and as you can see on

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
pretty nice aim and as you can see on
the<00:02:07.950> CPU<00:02:08.369> temperature<00:02:09.890> stationary<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.239> 35<00:02:12.239> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the CPU temperature stationary at 35 it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
the CPU temperature stationary at 35 it
never<00:02:13.319> occurs

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
never occurs

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.910 
never occurs
40<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:16.190> yeah<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:17.050> basically<00:02:18.050> this<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.560> if

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
40 and so yeah and basically this is if

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.910 
40 and so yeah and basically this is if
you're<00:02:19.100> actually<00:02:19.820> curious<00:02:20.180> about<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.230> heat

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you're actually curious about the heat

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.010 
you're actually curious about the heat
of<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.040> CPU<00:02:22.630> don't<00:02:23.630> worry

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
of your CPU don't worry

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.440 
of your CPU don't worry
and<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.920> I've<00:02:25.040> had<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:25.430> overcoat<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.270> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
and because I've had this overcoat for a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.630 
and because I've had this overcoat for a
long<00:02:26.930> time<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:30.470> has<00:02:30.650> been<00:02:30.800> safe<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.490> me

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
long time and this has been safe for me

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.090 
long time and this has been safe for me
to<00:02:31.790> use<00:02:31.940> anyway<00:02:32.380> now<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:33.830> into<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
to use anyway now if we go into the

to use anyway now if we go into the
overclocking<00:02:34.550> table<00:02:34.850> again<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.330> we<00:02:35.480> go<00:02:35.630> to

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
overclocking table again and we go to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.490 
overclocking table again and we go to
the<00:02:35.840> PCIe<00:02:36.380> frequency<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.310> at<00:02:37.580> 100<00:02:38.000> now<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:39.350> do

the PCIe frequency it's at 100 now to do

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.080 
the PCIe frequency it's at 100 now to do

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
this the very first time I ever done

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.190 
this the very first time I ever done
this<00:02:41.360> wise

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
this wise

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.220 
this wise
I<00:02:42.580> kept<00:02:43.580> crashing<00:02:44.030> my<00:02:44.120> PC<00:02:44.480> because<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.840> had<00:02:45.080> no

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
I kept crashing my PC because I had no

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.330 
I kept crashing my PC because I had no
idea<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.770> was<00:02:45.920> about

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
idea what it was about

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.290 
idea what it was about
now<00:02:47.030> I've<00:02:47.209> only<00:02:47.330> got<00:02:47.540> 512<00:02:48.850> megabyte<00:02:49.850> graphics

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
now I've only got 512 megabyte graphics

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.170 
now I've only got 512 megabyte graphics
card<00:02:50.540> right<00:02:50.720> now<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> my<00:02:51.080> PCI<00:02:51.500> Express<00:02:52.430> slot<00:02:52.820> so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
card right now in my PCI Express slot so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.320 
card right now in my PCI Express slot so
I<00:02:53.480> couldn't<00:02:54.050> put<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.530> high<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.120> was

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
I couldn't put it that high what I was

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.180 
I couldn't put it that high what I was
doing<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.600> was<00:02:56.630> putting<00:02:56.989> our<00:02:57.170> way<00:02:57.320> up<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.620> 10<00:02:57.890> and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
doing I was putting our way up to 10 and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.810 
doing I was putting our way up to 10 and
clocking<00:02:58.550> go<00:02:59.290> and<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.440> clash<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:00.860> system<00:03:01.190> but

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
clocking go and it clash my system but

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.460 
clocking go and it clash my system but
what<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.060> figured<00:03:02.420> out<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> best<00:03:02.810> way<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.020> do<00:03:03.290> is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
what I figured out the best way to do is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.449 
what I figured out the best way to do is
is<00:03:03.910> auto<00:03:04.910> run<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.420> program<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:06.140> or<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.160> apply

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
is auto run this program and or to apply

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.500 
is auto run this program and or to apply
the<00:03:07.520> program<00:03:08.330> at<00:03:09.110> stop<00:03:09.580> now<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.150> nudge<00:03:11.360> it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
the program at stop now if you nudge it

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.460 
the program at stop now if you nudge it
up<00:03:11.630> everyone<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.290> preschool<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:15.110> will<00:03:15.260> go<00:03:15.350> up

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
up everyone in preschool it will go up

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.130 
up everyone in preschool it will go up
and<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.520> keep<00:03:16.730> doing<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.660> only<00:03:17.959> way

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and just keep doing it now the only way

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.110 
and just keep doing it now the only way
to<00:03:18.200> find<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.620> your<00:03:18.769> maximum<00:03:19.250> PCI<00:03:19.670> Express

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
to find out your maximum PCI Express

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.729 
to find out your maximum PCI Express
slot<00:03:20.570> as<00:03:20.750> em<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:23.209> have<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.900> basically<00:03:24.110> crash

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
slot as em you have to basically crash

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.310 
slot as em you have to basically crash
your<00:03:24.950> system<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:26.360> find<00:03:26.750> out<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.080> maximum<00:03:27.260> so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
your system to find out the maximum so

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.590 
your system to find out the maximum so
104<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.769> highest<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.610> actually<00:03:31.760> go<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.390> I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
104 is a highest I can actually go if I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.050 
104 is a highest I can actually go if I

go to what if I go to up 105 and click

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.690 
go to what if I go to up 105 and click
go<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:35.540> will<00:03:36.019> crash<00:03:36.230> my<00:03:36.410> system<00:03:36.769> so<00:03:37.040> I'm<00:03:37.250> staying

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
go I will crash my system so I'm staying

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.210 
go I will crash my system so I'm staying
at<00:03:38.030> 104<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.780> set<00:03:42.080> guys<00:03:42.350> that's<00:03:42.920> how<00:03:43.160> to

at 104 and that set guys that's how to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.080 
at 104 and that set guys that's how to

limits guys and if you'll die Oh she'll

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.380 
limits guys and if you'll die Oh she'll
don't<00:03:54.950> think<00:03:55.280> about<00:03:55.400> putting<00:03:55.820> our<00:03:56.030> way<00:03:56.239> up

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
don't think about putting our way up

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.270 
don't think about putting our way up
when<00:03:56.630> we<00:03:56.840> open<00:03:57.049> our<00:03:57.110> way<00:03:57.230> up<00:03:57.350> because<00:03:57.920> it's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
when we open our way up because it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.440 
when we open our way up because it's
probably<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:58.670> off<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:59.000> you're<00:03:59.090> just<00:03:59.180> going<00:03:59.390> to

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
probably not off it you're just going to

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390 
probably not off it you're just going to
bust<00:03:59.630> your<00:03:59.780> cpu<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.620> leave<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.220> as

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
bust your cpu so just leave it with as

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.130 
bust your cpu so just leave it with as
at<00:04:01.910> its<00:04:02.230> top<00:04:03.230> maximum<00:04:03.860> level<00:04:04.430> here<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:05.110> as<00:04:06.110> I

at its top maximum level here and as I

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.860 
at its top maximum level here and as I

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
doing the PCI Express frequency here so

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.770 
doing the PCI Express frequency here so
104<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.470> my<00:04:12.650> highest<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:14.000> may<00:04:14.209> be<00:04:14.420> able<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.630> go

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
104 is my highest you may be able to go

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.620 
104 is my highest you may be able to go
