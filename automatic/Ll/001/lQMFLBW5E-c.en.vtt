00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
personally because I'm a 3d animation

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.820 
personally because I'm a 3d animation
major<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:08.000> graphics<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.810> if<00:02:08.990> graphics<00:02:09.500> suck

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
mouth side to side you can make your

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.430 
mouth side to side you can make your
eyes<00:02:40.370> bigger<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.940> smaller<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.020> meet<00:02:42.230> you
