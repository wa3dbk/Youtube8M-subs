 his parent desire common good methods 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.780
 completely different first in comics 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.240
 superman will face many challenges 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.430
 which he will throw leksu 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.189
 luteur being here only 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.770
 pawn in the space collector game

 Brainiac who in turn craves 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.460
 get and deliver as they say on 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.100
 regiment in his and not without that considerable 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.950
 collection city metropolis and bargain 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.510

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.390
 incidentally Morisson will tell us 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.060
 your vision of how clarke came to us 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.369
 to the land and the history of his newly minted 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.379
 parents John and Ken March 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.110
 i would call superman morrison in this 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.360
 the comic book is more mundane here its 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
 can install not only krypton or 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 as big as doomsday 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.390
 it would seem an ordinary train rushing on 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.640
 tremendous speed which turns out to be 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 hard enough to stop the superman 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.019
 without any consequences for yourself 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.129
 There are a couple more important features in 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.200
 new superman 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.629
 but do not want to tell them but you 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 will be surprised like me when you find out about 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.459
 as if they had not turned around for a long time 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.030
 the events of this series are just superman 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.129
 21st century new mighty and dangerous and near 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.590
 software does not scare opponents red 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.720
 eyes shine in the dark but in spite of everything 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.849
 he is young and hell 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.730
 perfect reflection of the series name 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.769
 perfectly reveals the character my son 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.079
 while demonstrating a large share 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.489
 action and all this leaves together 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.859
 great impression 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.780
 there is an opposition between the hero 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.549
 what superman looks up to simple 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.099
 citizens he helps 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.170
 and the threat to national security 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.760
 what does the rest of him perceive with 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.220
 the difference is that here it is all this 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.590
 frankly he begs for arranging 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.989
 bad people flying scattered take 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.239
 and threats and destroy tanks comics 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.130
 suitable for everyone but an ardent fan of superman 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.620
 in some moments he may not 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.810
