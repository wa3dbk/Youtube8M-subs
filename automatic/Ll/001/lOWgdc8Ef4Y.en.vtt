00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.880
 Hello everyone and you have all that ye 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.720
 I hope that this week's passage at the end 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.579
 and more when we are on vacation and 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.419
 that we are on vacation that better 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.449
 video that one that I carry in my suitcase more 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.460
 more outfit tips I bring you the one I wear 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.130
 my suitcase to show you a little 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.470
 things that I take also I am going to give you 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.700
 some tips so you have more 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.770
 space in the suitcase or tips 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.480
 organization 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.220
 and also a travel outfit to go very 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.410
 comfortable and simple so I hope that you 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.270
 like a lot very much the video I would 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.220
 first thing I do is look at the time that 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 although it seems easy, many people 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.120
 forget to do it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.130
 good 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.050
 and the next thing I do is prepare a 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.120
 list with all the things that I have 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 designed to carry and I recommend you to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.830
 the pants take half of the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.200
 days you are going as T - shirts will also 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.140
 I recommend carrying some very basic and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.119
 colors stick with everything like 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.450
 the sweater and the jacket that both 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.460
 combine with anything and that is not 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.040
 I forgot the pajamas that I already know 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.650
 forgot more than once for shoes 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.130
 something comfortable and that stick with all the 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.130
 garments 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.509
 now we go with the placement of the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.509
 things 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.670
 I always put pants first 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.300
 well stretched so they do not wrinkle and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.440
 then jerseys and jackets 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 after the piece that we have left over 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.520
 trousers we put it over the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700
 jerseys and jackets and everything 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 well well ordered and a trick so that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.420
 T-shirts do not take care of very little 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 space is to make them like rolls and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.649
 then we will place the shirts in the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.649
 holes that have remained 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.370
 besides placing the shirts in the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.940
 holes you can also put some other 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.470
 thing like the comb the loaders and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.470
 other small things 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.650
 now it's the turn of the necesary I have 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.890
 this one that is very small and occupies very little 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.080
 space inside I take the pasta and the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.989
 toothbrush a deodorant 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.640
 small so that I fit inside kleenex 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.610
 since they are very important to me in 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.930
 This time of year I also carry a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.930
 little makeup 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.690
 and finally I got moisturizer but 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.720
 a second this will occupy me a lot 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.090
 space so for this trick are 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.560
 you will need hair scissors your cream 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.560
 moisturizer and a straw 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.600
 to the elephant 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.000
 d 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.310
 it's very simple you only have to 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.890
 take the straw and pretend to be 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.800
 drinking a soda with straw 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.740
 you have to absorb more or less 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.290
 until the cream rises a little before 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.150
 of the fold of the straw once done 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.970
 that with the help of a paper you go to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.460
 remove the excess cream to see if it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.480
 I can explain with the following you have 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.060
 to leave two species of eyelashes that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.180
 do not have traces of cream for later 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.650
 fold them crazy has left over from the straw 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.650
 you can cut it with a scissor 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.630
 and the last step of this trick is to catch 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.850
 zeal and those little ones that I have told you 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.750
 fold them and stick them to the straw with 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.730
 zeal 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.730
 yes no 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480
 m 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.440
 and already it is super handy to be 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.000
 occupy very little space and if you go to 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.100
 use more than one cream you can 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.290
 differentiate them by means of a piece of paper and 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.550
 putting the name for example the shampoo 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.550
 gel or whatever 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.889
 By e 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.889
 and won 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.809
 and once having placed all the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:16.800
 things we are ready to close 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:19.770
 our suitcase as an outfit and if you go in 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.379
 car or plane or any other 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.569
 transportation and are several hours of travel 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.099
 we look for something comfortable and for nothing 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.229
 reloaded 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.569
 I personally recommend some laws 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.909
 that are the heads of comfort and 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.490
 also a wide shirt so that we 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:38.940
 feel more comfortable 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.940
 yes 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.030
 Carry no purse is much more comfortable one 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.270
 backpack and you fit many more things and 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.250
 Of course I would wear shoes 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.729
 normal sneakers and current ni 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.200
 heels or boots or anything like that 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.270
 exists 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.160
 and good guys and girls this has been 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.790
 Every game today I hope you have 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.520
 given some ideas and if there were things that 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.260
