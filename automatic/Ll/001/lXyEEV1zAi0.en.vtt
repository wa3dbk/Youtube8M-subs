 I could beat here with a broach 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.330

 field ones connect let's say a 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:03:07.209
 why is he painful therefore why strike 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.209
 not a hard blow he is so heavy 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:19.810
 there is no weapon 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.810

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.760

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.020
 acts understand continue to work until 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:28.450
 don't finish 2 1 right here 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:29.200
 that only a couple of forces is a couple of forces 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:45.820
 to give 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:50.710
 why does heat resistance force go there 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.130
 and can't hold a tree here she 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.130
 stayed 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:02.169
 left the village left before and mine 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:09.440

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:49.100
 so here we go where giving there 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:53.930
 make it the opposite hand you 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.400
 I want to start as scientists have more 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.030
 felt more strongly 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:06.830

 holding zara sandals on 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:24.140
 but they themselves are not the ultimate goal. 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.820
 how to give a situation that is, I can 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.230
 call here anything you can see 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.919
 do and it remains. 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:34.330
