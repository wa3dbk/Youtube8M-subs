now<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.829> definitely<00:00:44.010> mix<00:00:44.700> these<00:00:44.940> colors

now you can definitely mix these colors
with<00:00:45.450> lip<00:00:45.629> liners<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> wanted<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> focus

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
with lip liners but I wanted to focus

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.940 
with lip liners but I wanted to focus
primarily<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.940> actual<00:00:48.680> lipstick<00:00:49.680> asked

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
primarily on actual lipstick asked

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.000 
primarily on actual lipstick asked
products<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.440> particularly

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
products and this one is particularly

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.250 
products and this one is particularly
appropriate<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.329> matte<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
appropriate because it's matte and I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.900 
appropriate because it's matte and I
think<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:55.710> fitting<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> trend

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
think it's very fitting with that trend

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.349 
think it's very fitting with that trend
this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.260> revlon<00:00:58.800> matte<00:00:58.829> balm<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> sultry

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this is the revlon matte balm and sultry

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450 
this is the revlon matte balm and sultry
as<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.050> pretty<00:01:01.260> true<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
as you can see it's pretty true to the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
as you can see it's pretty true to the
tube<00:01:02.910> color<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.799> result<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
tube color a result that you get on the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
tube color a result that you get on the
lip<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.240> bit<00:01:06.450> more<00:01:06.840> bricky<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
lip it's a little bit more bricky a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
lip it's a little bit more bricky a
little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.400> more<00:01:08.580> red<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.420> definitely

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
little bit more red but it's definitely

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.730 
little bit more red but it's definitely
like<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> 90s<00:01:11.460> type<00:01:12.330> lip<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
like a 90s type lip and I think that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
like a 90s type lip and I think that
this<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.040> great<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.460> anyone<00:01:14.790> who<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> looking
