gainer chances are it's because you have
a<00:03:17.630> very<00:03:17.930> high<00:03:18.170> energy<00:03:18.680> needs<00:03:18.920> combined<00:03:19.670> with<00:03:19.850> a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
a very high energy needs combined with a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.120 
a very high energy needs combined with a
very<00:03:20.120> low<00:03:20.360> appetite<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.560> keep<00:03:21.740> in<00:03:21.860> mind<00:03:22.040> that

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
very low appetite so keep in mind that

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.800 
very low appetite so keep in mind that
any<00:03:22.310> additional<00:03:22.790> cardio<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.450> do<00:03:23.600> is

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
any additional cardio that you do is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.480 
any additional cardio that you do is
only<00:03:23.990> going<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.350> raise<00:03:24.650> those<00:03:24.950> energy<00:03:25.310> needs

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
only going to raise those energy needs

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.610 
only going to raise those energy needs
even<00:03:25.760> higher<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.630> might<00:03:27.080> be<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> good<00:03:27.320> idea<00:03:27.410> to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
even higher so might be a good idea to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.110 
even higher so might be a good idea to
keep<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.100> minimum<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.610> could<00:03:28.880> also

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
keep it to a minimum that you could also

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.240 
keep it to a minimum that you could also
