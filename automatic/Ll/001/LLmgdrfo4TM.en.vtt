00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.239
 be a problem after buying these 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.059
 The first thing I did was call skype 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.299
 I go into the game without hearing a single one 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 sound from the game 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:42.049

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.049

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.460
 again a small article about these headphones 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.170
 and there thanks to this man who 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.979
 wrote a solution to this problem and here I am 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 for you and in u-tube I will tell 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.960
 his words and show you how to do it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.459
 So the first thing you need to go to start 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:19.410
 further control panel further 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:20.910
 sound sound here you have it flashed 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.110
 window 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.910
 that is, most likely you will have 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.310
 speakers but either something else 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.250
 Here on them, the speakers will stand 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 tick what you do find your 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.030

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.010
 chat x3000 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.100
 click on them with the right mouse click and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.100
 use the default here i am already 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.370
 used therefore here such an item 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.100
 there will not be such a tick then 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.810
 well ok now you start to hear 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.910
 all sound music 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.519

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.130
 go record here will be a microphone 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.120

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.290
 use use default 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.860
 That's basically all the headphones are configured 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.989
 you can hear you all just hear 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.329
 Amazingly these headphones I purchased for 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.049
 1400 rubles but on the Yandex market they are 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.200
