 no I'm kidding it's a little school so 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.879
 this is the irb of fist this talent and the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.010
 mode is in the description ap 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.790
 this bone writes how to install it 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 but I will show you how 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.079
 so find this little chicken this chicken 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.489
 so is at the road parked right there by 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.960
 against you will have noticed that my toy 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.460
 years old that my game is in English 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 it is simply in English I 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 put it simply english because 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 soon I started classes 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.590
 English 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 so I have to adapt a bit to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 English so this is this part to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.260
 RaudiÃ¨re white Anthouard to travel fast 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.400
 have far away anyriÃ¨s yeah I have an axiom 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.229
 sick, it's because I have to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.100
 take classes 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 so here we go find our 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.619
 companion chicken it's gone it's 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.490
 just find hours on the stairs 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.710
 6.6 m pop up here he is our companion 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 pulley so first of all he's not going 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.930
 follow you 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.049
 you have to point it out somewhere 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.030
 like this you will see as you 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 see the cursed in French but not the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.759
 game because I put in English that's it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.070
 which is good with this mode is that in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.780
 the more it in French so you are spoiled 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.470
 from the side you have a chicken companion 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960
 and a word of French 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 so here you have various options 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 but he did not have the traditional 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.329
 option follow me and to have it all 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.409
 it's just a little good ok case 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.100
 in this match and I do not know why 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.509
 have not corrected 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.439
 you have to do the second 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.579
 option is to say it would have to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.210
 you do something for me 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.060
 that's after the you indicated a little 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.650
 report path does not matter it can be there 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.400
 Amen you little chicken here is situ 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.970
 we will have to talk to him again 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.350
 he can follow you follow me here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.840
 so as you can see this Thursday 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.970
 chicken is the back of a chicken in 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.140
 somehow with the headphones and with his 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.760
 little bag you'll guess 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.850
 why his little bag not what 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 can carry all your stuff 1-1 all 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.230
 to business and unlimited way so you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 frankly I never put I put 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.550
 a business package 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.440
 I think he has no limits he did not 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.459
 not said but the weight limits for 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.610
 carry your stuff that's really 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.750
 unlimited so here's the usual 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.740
 done as usual with all 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.570
 companions I must change 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.580
 some things with you one of the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.680
 classic and after you put him all 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.180
 what you want inside flights to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.790
 the inside of the chicken in the bag 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.620
 when we clear and after there is just one 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.940
 little note you actually know 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.270

 nurses who sent his chicken a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.320
 day when I told a story to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.400
 defend defender maybe depth 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.870

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.040
 all my chickens all my chickens have 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.830
 have nightmares 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.630
 except for a month there and my heart s except 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.430
 one the strongest and the most courageous of 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.350
 my chickens after hearing this 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.830
 story he decided to leave to your

 that we have and this chicken actually he also 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.660
