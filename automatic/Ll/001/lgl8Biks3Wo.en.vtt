00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.410 
you how to get the rhythm section you
know<00:00:07.859> every<00:00:08.220> rhythm<00:00:08.490> section<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> go<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
know every rhythm section that you go to

know every rhythm section that you go to
every<00:00:09.870> set<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> whoops<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.590> any<00:00:10.769> track<00:00:11.010> are

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
going to be different obviously but the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.499 
going to be different obviously but the
number<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:13.980> thing<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.330> stay

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
have no flow and that will equate to you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
transition and then as they go up they

transition and then as they go up they
pump<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.770> well<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.219> gain<00:00:53.550> speed<00:00:53.940> often<00:00:54.719> I'll

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
pump up as well or gain speed often I'll

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.910 
pump up as well or gain speed often I'll
need<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> upslope<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> down<00:00:56.460> step

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
down and you get back towards the bike

down and you get back towards the bike
and<00:01:41.580> that'll<00:01:41.820> naturally<00:01:42.330> bring<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> front<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and that'll naturally bring the front of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
and that'll naturally bring the front of
the<00:01:43.680> bike<00:01:43.830> up<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.820> roll<00:01:45.060> through

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the bike up and you will roll through

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
the bike up and you will roll through
the<00:01:45.570> double<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.160> will<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> good

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the double and then you will get a good

particular course there's a corner right
there<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.300> 180<00:03:04.780> degrees<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.320> flat<00:03:05.590> so

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
there it's 180 degrees and flat so

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.530 
there it's 180 degrees and flat so
you're<00:03:06.010> pretty<00:03:06.160> much<00:03:06.340> coming<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.790> stop<00:03:07.180> and

much<00:03:11.980> speed<00:03:12.280> as<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.520> can<00:03:12.730> coming<00:03:13.180> into<00:03:13.300> it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
much speed as you can coming into it

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.180 
much speed as you can coming into it
watch-chain<00:03:14.110> carry<00:03:14.530> speed<00:03:14.800> through<00:03:15.100> the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
watch-chain carry speed through the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.150 
watch-chain carry speed through the
finish<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.640> not<00:03:15.790> get<00:03:15.970> past<00:03:16.210> so<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
finish and not get past so the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.340 
finish and not get past so the
professional<00:03:18.760> technique<00:03:19.120> would<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.140> come

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
professional technique would be to come

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.680 
professional technique would be to come
through<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> turn<00:03:20.890> start<00:03:21.850> peddling<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.420> then

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
through the turn start peddling and then

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.660 
through the turn start peddling and then
a<00:03:22.720> few<00:03:22.960> feet<00:03:23.170> before<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.590> jump<00:03:23.800> get<00:03:24.400> into<00:03:24.640> a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
a few feet before the jump get into a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.940 
a few feet before the jump get into a
little<00:03:24.940> bit<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.210> pedal<00:03:25.840> wheelie<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.350> be

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
little bit of a pedal wheelie and be

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.040 
little bit of a pedal wheelie and be
able<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.250> continue<00:03:27.790> peddling<00:03:28.330> all<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.960> way

the<00:04:51.370> brakes<00:04:51.610> too<00:04:51.850> much<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.420> a<00:04:52.690> good<00:04:53.020> way<00:04:53.170> to

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
the brakes too much and a good way to

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.890 
the brakes too much and a good way to
practice<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.270> roll<00:04:55.510> into<00:04:55.750> it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
practice it is to is to roll into it

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.570 
practice it is to is to roll into it
from<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.170> certain<00:04:56.530> point<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.950> then<00:04:57.070> go<00:04:57.280> throw

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
from a certain point and then go throw

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.430 
from a certain point and then go throw
the<00:04:57.700> back<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.120> further<00:04:58.300> back<00:04:58.510> we<00:04:58.900> put<00:04:58.930> into<00:04:59.200> it

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
the back and further back we put into it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.550 
the back and further back we put into it
some<00:04:59.730> pedals<00:05:00.730> you<00:05:00.970> can<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:02.200> go<00:05:02.320> do<00:05:02.530> that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
some pedals you can you go do that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.110 
some pedals you can you go do that
switch<00:05:02.980> over<00:05:03.160> as<00:05:03.400> smoothly<00:05:03.790> as<00:05:03.970> possible

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
switch over as smoothly as possible

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.150 
switch over as smoothly as possible
simply<00:05:04.630> always<00:05:05.110> keeping<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.470> traction<00:05:06.040> on

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
simply always keeping that traction on

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.250 
simply always keeping that traction on
those<00:05:06.280> tires<00:05:06.600> it's<00:05:07.600> pretty<00:05:07.840> quick<00:05:07.990> too

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
those tires it's pretty quick too

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.770 
those tires it's pretty quick too
quickly<00:05:08.590> but<00:05:08.860> then<00:05:09.790> we'll<00:05:09.970> doing<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.480> again

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
quickly but then we'll doing it again

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.730 
quickly but then we'll doing it again
and<00:05:11.020> again<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.530> again<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.920> again<00:05:12.190> maybe<00:05:13.740> they

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
and again and again and again maybe they

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.500 
and again and again and again maybe they
come<00:05:14.980> here<00:05:15.100> move<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.460> 20<00:05:15.760> times<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.270> in<00:05:16.420> it

come here move just 20 times in it in it

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.450 
come here move just 20 times in it in it
