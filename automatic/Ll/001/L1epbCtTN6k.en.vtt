00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.673
 At this year's MWC conference 

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.042
 Opera released the Opera Mini for iPhone browser 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 Because of the built-in Opera Turbo technology 

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.781
 And can make the page open six times faster 

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:19.856
 Also sent to the App Store for review a few days ago. 

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.090
 Will Apple let browsers other than Safari work on the iPhone? 

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.420
 We don’t know 

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.426
 But Taiwan Opera has taken the real machine as a show 

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.963
 So Tekang went to the Taiwan branch of Taiwan. 

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.150
 carry out testing 

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.157
 Let's take a look at some features of the Opera Mini for iPhone. 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 Basically Safari is a pretty good browser 

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.041
 In fact, the Opera Mini design is aimed at 

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.344
 Business users or people who travel frequently 

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:53.952
 He may be at the airport 

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.428
 Or some countries where network construction is under development 

00:00:57.826 --> 00:01:01.490
 Local may not have 3G network 

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.495
 Opera Mini can be used under 2G and Edge networks 

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.534
 Run very fast 

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:11.910
 Relative to other browsers 

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:12.970
 According to the actual measurement 

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.973
 iPhone built-in Safari under 2G Edge connection 

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.443
 The speed of opening the T-home page is 

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.010
 1 minute 45 seconds 

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:22.016
 And Opera Mini because of Turbo 

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.115
 It only takes 25 seconds to open the webpage 

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.418
 Although it is not six times, it is four times as many 

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.254
 The most common difference is data traffic. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 Actually as long as 1/12 of Safari 

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.993
 Can save a considerable amount of money 

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.129
 The entire interface of Opera Mini 

00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:41.380
 Is the Speed ​​Dial with Jiugongge 

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:43.800
 This is Opera's original function. 

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:46.120
 This feature is also used by other browsers. 

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:51.160
 The main function of Speed ​​Dial is 

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.690
 You can quickly open your favorite website 

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.980
 In addition, we also have Opera Link 

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.590
 Is to put your computer on the Opera browser 

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.960
 Bookmarks and Speed ​​Dial sync to your phone 

00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.660
 It is also very convenient to use 

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.240
 Of course, Opera Mini can also read RSS. 

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.840
 How long does it take for Apple to review the Opera Mini? 

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:22.670
 Now just guess right. 

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:24.680
 Opera will send you an iPhone 

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.780
 We are very confident 

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.310
 We are confident that we will 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.490
 Because we did not violate 

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.790
 Apple's terms for developers 

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.830
 If Taiwan’s netizens won the prize 

00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:43.830
 Will it be sent to Taiwan? 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830
 Will be sent to Taiwan 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.460
 Opera Mini fast features 

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.460
 Convenient features for syncing with bookmarks 

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.480
 Very easy to use on the iPhone 

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.820
 Will the apple let it pass? 

00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:56.820
 Let us wait and see 

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.080
 TK will continue to follow the report
