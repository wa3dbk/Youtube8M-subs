00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.970
 to 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.040
 friends as they are I am Luis I said and 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.240
 well let's see a direct comparison 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.650
 so that you know the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.130
 physical differences of the iphone5 s 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.009
 against the choose two we have here the two 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 you can check the equipment and then 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:29.770
 good the truth is that if in the size 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:33.140
 directly you see a major change 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.780
 the time the size here yes 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.480
 if it looks pretty in the case of the choose 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.360
 two are 5 points 2 inches against 4 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.670
 inches of the iphone 5s are 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.230
 remarkable differences let's see the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 back of you can do 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.519
 the direct comparison at this time 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 this area still has plastics 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.970
 of protection so good these 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.829
 spots is not that they come with equipment 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.230
 it just comes straight out 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.390
 from your box we will see for example 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.540
 here you see the volume controls on 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.070
 control to put it in vibration or newt 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.190
 here you can see that the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.340
 volume controls and the home button 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.430
 they are on the back of the choose 2 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 here in this case you see that we're going to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.229
 remove but hey this is the sensor of 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.429
 fingerprint which is a change 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.300
 important in the case of the new 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:26.840
 apple devices that feature 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 this sensor we are going to see it here 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.450
 you see also the home button looks through 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.630
 example on the camera here is also 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.759
 the camera in this case on the subject d 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.299
 cameras there is an interesting difference 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.539
 what good is there to check here are 13 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.159
 megapixels against 8 megapixels the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:55.819
 front cameras there is also a 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:00.140
 difference in the case of axis 2 are 2.1 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.930
 megapixels against 1.2 megapixels 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.850
 there is something that is perhaps very important 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.729
 to note and it's the subject of the battery 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.009
 in the case of choose 2 has a 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.030
 Internal battery of 3000 thousand jumper is 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.170
 against the iphone 5 s battery that is 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.170
 of 1570 milian pÃ©rez that is to say the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.220
 battery life of this equipment 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.400
 of the choose 2 is going almost double with 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.870
 respect to the iphone 5 's so it's 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.020
 we will have to consider this this point and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.550
 There are there characteristics in different 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.290
 sides but good what is a fact 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.140
 is that good has a processor 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.420
 64 bits cons good a processor that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.880
 is 32 bits which is what has been 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.239
 handled in the industry in this case if 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.030
 in part teacher can support 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.989
 bending is much more demanding the iphone 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.950
 5 s there is a led flash in the case of the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:05.269
 iphone 5 that another important point then 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.840
 if the weight is 112 grams cons 143 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.739
 grams 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.470
 they are interesting features that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.620
 you can 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.550
 check and that they may be interested 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.770
 obviously it's a team that works 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.500
 about android is a team that works 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.320
 about ios in the case of iphone 5 is and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.620
 well you will decide what equipment 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.630
 I would like more if you to me what 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.330
 they ask with what equipment I would have 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.390
 I did it because on the one hand if I have a lot 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.950
 of platform on the envelope apple but 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.070
 On the other hand, if I want all my 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.890
 applications work with each other so that 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.950
 be much more effective I think in this 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.980
 case yes yes on those teams I do 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.630
 I would choose the l light but good that is 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.610
 I leave you to your decision every 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.440
 who can make the decision that 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.640
 you want let's review other 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 comparative but for now 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.680
