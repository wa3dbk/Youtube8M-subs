saved my victory rush for if I get 80%

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.740 
saved my victory rush for if I get 80%
and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.189> once<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> next<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> gets<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.360> near

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and so once the next it gets too near

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.429 
and so once the next it gets too near
50%<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.159> 60<00:01:14.689> 56%<00:01:15.689> she<00:01:15.869> starts<00:01:16.229> running
