00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 well here I am back again I am 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.839
 Colombian Dominican 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.839
 I want you to put into practice 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:16.940
 comfortable feeder for our birds 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.000
 so we go to the wedding 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.000
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.350
 Lord of the tools to use and 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 the articles 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.189
 This is 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.720
 a piece of 2-inch tube well 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.720
 we have a 2-inch elbow 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.860
 we have a 2 - inch bung 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.650
 let's use the drill 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 a jig as he also uses a 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:51.450
 yellow weld 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.100
 under the cement v6 a wick and also 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.760
 use the tweezers 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.910
 we can put the rod to the solar in 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.440
 Soak to remove the layer more 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.979
 easy 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.979
 the first thing we are going to do vc 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.710
 Soak the part of the tube to stick it 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.710
 best 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.260
 no danger 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.760
 I am manageable 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.200
 unless one did not do those 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.899
 substances 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.899
 or is close to winning and that something 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.550
 he causes harm but hatred has not only 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.940
 nothing 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.940
 we give him 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.660
 Now let's get where aside 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.550
 plug 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.080
 respect 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.120
 we covered the PVC because there was talk of a 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.800
 little strong 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.380
 the segment know 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.950
 then 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 with a hacksaw a hand saw 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.000
 let's remove this part 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.930
 when eating 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.930
 to the almost comedy 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.390
 we are never again 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.410
 we have to remove that 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.720
 this part so they take the coupling 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 come to the cage before the cage the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.709
 mesh 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.170
 like this part of you can not dock 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.160
 well but if you take it away will buy 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.140
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.590
 which prevents this and that's why we have 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.590
 what to remove 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.959
 and likewise right that I 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.090
 if everyone can observe the part of 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.550
 AndrÃ© is in the dark 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.160
 what should we do to make our birds 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.410
 have a better view of the food how 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.090
 changes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.730
 we do a perforation in stages for 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 that penetrate the light 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.750
 but let's do 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.909
 we made mistakes 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.730
 and if it penetrates 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
 you know our birds have more 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.170
 vision when the light on this plate for 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.560
 see the food 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.270
 now 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.650
 let's adjust the jigsaw 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.519
 today we are going to put 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.519
 the wick 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.730
 well let's make hatred hate 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.730
 one and another 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.230
 in yellow cargo is going to hold 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.440
 our feeder 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.760
 the mesh of the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.760
 we mark with a pen 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.849
 it should be a bit high so that it does not 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:41.889
 know others think with the rod 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.889
 our fish head white environment 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.090
 Now let's remove the layer 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.880
 that has the electron 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.800
 well we have the rod ready 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.730
 now let's go through the hole that 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.730
 we made the holes 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.020
 yes that way 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.330
 we press a little here with the clamp 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.330
 upwards 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:35.500
 we go to several wounds and the others in 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:38.530
 wayne and we doubled the yellow with them 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.280
 upwards as they have had we are going to 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.280
 do two have had 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:57.230
 up to where we create 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.230
 we think it can be 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.370
 ah 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.370
 now let's cut this part 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.200
 it's the excess that we do not need 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.740
 towards our partner is ready 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.740
 ah 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.820
 to ready to use 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.760
 we throw the food here 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.380
 our birds restraint citrus light 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.870
 it penetrates through here and microsoft has more 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.870
 vision to see the food in the background 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.629
 well you're ready 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.980
 to use 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.070
 immediately 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.210
 We are going to show you how you put yourself 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.210
 place the stain 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.980
 with a limit 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.290
 one
