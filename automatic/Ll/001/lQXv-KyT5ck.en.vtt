00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 if i have a congratulations god give him one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.830
 nice place and then maybe search 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 then who knows that was two 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.210
 years ago and this year it was a knife 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.400
 and chairman of the vvcs players' union 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 again around the field in the philips 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 distinguish the stadium as the turf 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.130
 from the Premier League 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 we actually do that stinking yes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550
 best to name but a few 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 and therefore sometimes it depends on the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.019
 little things that are now or themselves 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 are not the first you can say the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 second but the first always counts 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 most so yes I am happy with it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 all feel crooked after each out 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 played match figure 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 The field was they played and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 figure that can go from one to 5 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.910
 but with a bad 2 reasonable 3 is good 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 4 very good and 5 are top field 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.920
 the field of psv eventually got one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 4.7 and 40 a figure where you as a club 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 be proud of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.460
 Well I think of first when you think the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.250
 club psv is willing to want one anyway 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 substantial investment 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.530
 to do in the lawn and afterwards 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 so we come to ensure that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.400
 we therefore use the means 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.530
 put dots on the i and make sure it 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.729
 at all times disappeared and play 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.410
 perfect size 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.090
 and apparently that I succeeded again 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.400
 yes you have played football yourself for a long time 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.869
 how important is the good field yes for 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.520
 a player it is the most important 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.800
 route your shoes must be important 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 the ball is important just one 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.130
 basic condition is that you have one more 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 good mat have a flat mat 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.369
 one that just plays nice football so yes 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.500
 I heard the massive fire 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.420
 say at a top club becomes a top field 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.070
 well that is not the case here and that 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.110
 is of course a nice compliment for that 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.790
 manage the grass that are despite 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.520
 Modesty think this price 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.520
 right in Eindhoven 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.950
 well we do everything for it and if then the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 users the players these suppliers 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.960
 that also invention then I certainly win 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.220
 the right the first row yes 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200
 psv has now been there for the second time 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.450
 won they thought you could win again 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.860
 you can always keep the field long 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.299
 keep the scale that is every year 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.460
 updated so it is not a switch scale 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.990
 but if the ball continues to roll like that and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.700
 anyone out there on word for it 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.470
 when the grass stays on, danny hes can 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.160
 nice direction again next season 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.160
 Eindhoven come
