everywhere but I have seen people store

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:07.210 
everywhere but I have seen people store
them<00:04:59.150> in<00:05:00.250> CD<00:05:01.250> cases<00:05:05.440> see<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.680> could<00:05:06.860> just<00:05:07.009> keep

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
them in CD cases see you could just keep

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.939 
them in CD cases see you could just keep
them<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.669> case<00:05:08.470> there's<00:05:09.470> also<00:05:09.620> little

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
them this in case there's also little

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.490 
them this in case there's also little
little<00:05:10.520> CD<00:05:10.729> cases<00:05:11.030> tinier<00:05:11.990> ones<00:05:12.199> than<00:05:12.470> that

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
little CD cases tinier ones than that

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.980 
little CD cases tinier ones than that
like<00:05:13.070> for<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.430> mini<00:05:13.610> CDs<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.840> would

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
like for the mini CDs that would

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.920 
like for the mini CDs that would
probably<00:05:15.410> be<00:05:15.560> a<00:05:15.919> good<00:05:16.160> idea<00:05:16.280> for<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:17.419> you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
probably be a good idea for this you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.860 
probably be a good idea for this you
could<00:05:18.110> hold<00:05:18.820> your<00:05:22.240> image<00:05:23.240> plates<00:05:23.510> in<00:05:23.690> there

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
could hold your image plates in there

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.100 
could hold your image plates in there
but<00:05:24.729> that's<00:05:25.729> it<00:05:26.000> that's<00:05:26.120> all<00:05:26.330> my<00:05:26.449> Conad<00:05:26.810> stuff

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
but that's it that's all my Conad stuff

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.980 
but that's it that's all my Conad stuff
and<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.800> generally<00:05:28.310> only<00:05:28.460> use<00:05:28.940> one<00:05:29.810> or<00:05:29.840> two

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
and I generally only use one or two

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.990 
and I generally only use one or two
plates<00:05:30.500> when<00:05:30.740> I'm<00:05:30.830> doing<00:05:31.099> a<00:05:31.159> design<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:31.849> I'll

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
plates when I'm doing a design so I'll

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.750 
plates when I'm doing a design so I'll
just<00:05:32.270> take<00:05:33.199> the<00:05:33.470> plates<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.919> I'm<00:05:34.039> using<00:05:34.250> and

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
just take the plates that I'm using and

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.149 
just take the plates that I'm using and
whatever<00:05:35.030> color<00:05:35.389> it<00:05:35.539> is<00:05:35.659> I'm<00:05:35.810> using<00:05:35.990> grab<00:05:36.949> my

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
whatever color it is I'm using grab my

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.790 
whatever color it is I'm using grab my
stamper<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:39.220> that's<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.430> so<00:05:41.090> I<00:05:41.389> don't<00:05:42.349> store

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
stamper and that's it so I don't store

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.450 
stamper and that's it so I don't store
these<00:05:43.010> in<00:05:43.400> any<00:05:43.550> kind<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.500> fancy<00:05:45.500> way<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:46.039> if

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
these in any kind of fancy way but if

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.180

you<00:05:46.729> want<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.180> could<00:05:47.330> use<00:05:47.510> a<00:05:47.810> CD<00:05:48.650> case<00:05:48.919> or

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190
