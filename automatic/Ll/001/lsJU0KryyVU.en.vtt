00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
actual achievement or trophy I'm just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
actual achievement or trophy I'm just
going<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.899> quick<00:01:46.439> through<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:46.890> ones

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
going really quick through these ones

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.840 
going really quick through these ones
the<00:01:47.700> blue<00:01:48.180> magnets<00:01:48.720> will<00:01:49.049> push<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.560> away<00:01:49.850> they

the blue magnets will push you away they

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.080 
the blue magnets will push you away they
act<00:01:51.689> kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.140> wind<00:01:52.470> turbines<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.790> then

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
act kind of like wind turbines and then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.889 
act kind of like wind turbines and then
the<00:01:54.270> red<00:01:54.540> magnets<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.350> suck<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
the red magnets will suck you in and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.580 
the red magnets will suck you in and
they<00:01:57.899> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> work<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.770> sucking<00:01:59.520> fans<00:01:59.909> for

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
they kind of work like sucking fans for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
they kind of work like sucking fans for
example<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.640> am<00:02:03.000> fast-forwarding<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
example and I am fast-forwarding a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.999 
example and I am fast-forwarding a
little<00:02:03.899> bit<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.200> showing<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> perfect

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
little bit here showing you the perfect

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.010 
little bit here showing you the perfect
solutions<00:02:05.729> again<00:02:06.149> these<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.600> much<00:02:06.840> much

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
solutions again these are much much

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.850 
solutions again these are much much
harder<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> Phoenix<00:02:08.069> actually

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
harder with the Phoenix actually

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.550 
harder with the Phoenix actually
here<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.490> level<00:02:10.820> six<00:02:11.090> completed<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:12.320> is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
here is level six completed and this is

here is level six completed and this is
where<00:02:12.890> you<00:02:13.010> want<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.280> pay<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:13.670> really

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
where you want to pay really really

close attention to level seven as you're
completing<00:02:16.940> level<00:02:17.480> seven<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:18.110> about<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.560> as

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
completing level seven go about it as

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.070 
completing level seven go about it as
you<00:02:18.980> normally<00:02:19.130> would<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.910> go<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.810> very

very end of the level in the middle of
the<00:02:24.140> screen<00:02:24.320> right<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.710> should<00:02:25.010> see<00:02:25.220> a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
the screen right now you should see a

very slowly just inch towards the finish
line<00:02:32.210> it'll<00:02:32.600> open<00:02:32.930> now<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.950> have<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.310> go

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
line it'll open now you have to go

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.370
