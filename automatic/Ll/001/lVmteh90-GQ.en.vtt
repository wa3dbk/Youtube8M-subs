method and I wanted to try out basically

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.730 
method and I wanted to try out basically
what<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.189> spend<00:00:30.140> 4<00:00:31.140> minutes<00:00:31.439> each

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
what you do is you spend 4 minutes each

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.610 
what you do is you spend 4 minutes each
day<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.149> hang<00:00:33.390> upside<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.870> well<00:00:34.320> not

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
day and you hang upside down well not

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190

then for 4 minutes you set your alarm

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
then for 4 minutes you set your alarm
clock<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.309> massage<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.790> skull<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
clock and you massage your skull and you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
can't massage when or without oil if you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.700 
can't massage when or without oil if you
were<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:47.969> oil<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.960> olive

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
were to do some oil you can use olive

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
were to do some oil you can use olive
oil<00:00:50.039> or<00:00:51.110> use<00:00:52.110> coconut<00:00:52.980> oil<00:00:53.250> both<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> which<00:00:54.059> are

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
oil or use coconut oil both of which are

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.470 
oil or use coconut oil both of which are
meant<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.730> promoting<00:00:56.730> hair<00:00:57.030> growth<00:00:57.270> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
meant to be promoting hair growth I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.349 
meant to be promoting hair growth I
think<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.809> idea<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> invert

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
think the idea is that when you invert

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.500 
think the idea is that when you invert
italic<00:01:00.960> yoga<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.789> blood<00:01:03.180> goes

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
italic yoga you know all your blood goes

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.670 
italic yoga you know all your blood goes
into<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.409> head<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.309> hands<00:01:06.299> creating<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
into your head and hands creating the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.330 
into your head and hands creating the
stimulation<00:01:08.450> for<00:01:09.450> hair<00:01:10.320> follicles<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> grow

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
stimulation for hair follicles to grow

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
stimulation for hair follicles to grow
faster<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.060> day<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.470> done
