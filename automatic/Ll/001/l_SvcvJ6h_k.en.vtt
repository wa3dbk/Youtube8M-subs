00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.490
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 Hello and welcome there 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 a term that has been around for several years 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 through the area circle hdmi this heidi 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 I think multimedia cable connections 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 plug and this hdmi she has as 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.849
 tv developed but dvi had so big 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 clunky plug that are from the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.949
 log from the chipsets at the end 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.099
 from the cable so not in the cable itself 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 compatible 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.460
 only hdmi also has the sound of it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.809
 and now you can think cable cable 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.700
 what should I know that from 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.040
 Reduction of power connector together 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 is not longer here is not so easy 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.829
 because they are only for a specific one 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 length defines the rates as the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.780
 data rates are relatively high 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.360
 I got a cable from me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 auvisio to two meters hdmi cable and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.109
 if I protect this plastic here 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.280
 corner to yours you can see here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.610
 typical the big hdmi plug of the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 has also do and there are now 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 this is a standard 1.3 standard 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 are now also 1.4 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 but now i do not put you any age 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.330
 but a point 4 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.100
 there is the main difference 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.619
 actually only that about it too 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 internet data are also running there 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.909
 veins in it that you almost network 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
 can send information with it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.250
 otherwise technically electric and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.570
 in terms of performance, it is the same 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.090
 cable here and there they should then 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 be careful that has 1816 on 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 is data transfer rate, the simple advises 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.610
 with 25 percent higher that sometimes gets 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.549
 but is actually wrong the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.570
 is then specified with 10 2 and the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.290
 bandwidth 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.649
 that's 340 megabits per second what 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.869
 So here's what they think 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.450
 It does not have to be a good cable 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.670
 be expensive but it must be good 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.819
 very important otherwise it could be 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.500
 that you have on your device on the television 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.700
 above all things with the cable longer 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.069
 suddenly there is nothing to see if 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.920
 the cable is purely electrical in order 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.050
 But the quality is just not right and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.280
 it is not enough for the bandwidth 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.950
 to be transferred 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.590
 always remember hdmi makes a great 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.800
 picture is great but good on and on 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.800
 it
