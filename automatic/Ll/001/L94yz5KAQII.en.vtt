00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
in our tons of fun with each of them

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
in our tons of fun with each of them
having<00:01:04.199> their<00:01:04.350> own<00:01:04.379> abilities<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> play

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
having their own abilities and play

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
having their own abilities and play
styles<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:07.049> i<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.740> noir<00:01:08.189> takes<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
styles but i just think noir takes the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450 
styles but i just think noir takes the
cake<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.330> terms<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.930> gameplay<00:01:10.340> compared<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
cake in terms of gameplay compared to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
cake in terms of gameplay compared to
the<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:11.790> three<00:01:12.030> spider-man's<00:01:12.689> noir<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the other three spider-man's noir is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649 
the other three spider-man's noir is
much<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.130> vulnerable<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> damage<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.509> can

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
much more vulnerable to damage and can

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.800 
much more vulnerable to damage and can
die<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.409> easily<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.909> means<00:01:18.090> noir<00:01:18.570> has

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
die very easily so this means noir has

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
die very easily so this means noir has
to<00:01:19.020> sneak<00:01:19.290> around<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.830> stealthily<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.759> out

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

to sneak around and stealthily take out
all<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.450> enemies<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.020> doing<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.979> tons

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
all the enemies and doing this is tons

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.450 
all the enemies and doing this is tons
of<00:01:24.000> fun<00:01:24.170> with<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> dark<00:01:25.619> black<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
experiences in any game there is nothing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
experiences in any game there is nothing
more<00:01:38.700> gratifying<00:01:39.270> than<00:01:39.810> taking<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> guy

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
more gratifying than taking out a guy

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
more gratifying than taking out a guy
from<00:01:40.979> behind<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.820> swinging<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
levels but the noir levels just matched

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.709 
levels but the noir levels just matched
the<00:01:57.570> style<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.469> well<00:01:59.060> including<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> bosses

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the style so well including the bosses

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.840 
the style so well including the bosses
I've<00:02:00.960> never<00:02:01.320> been<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.920> interested<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I've never been so interested in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
I've never been so interested in
learning<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.390> about<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.659> series<00:02:04.110> than<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.439> was

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
learning more about a series than I was

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
learning more about a series than I was
when<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.130> playing<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.790> noir<00:02:06.119> missions<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
when I was playing the noir missions the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.529 
when I was playing the noir missions the
best<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> describe<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> probably

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
best way I can describe it is probably

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.460 
best way I can describe it is probably
well<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.770> sneaking<00:02:11.220> around<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.790> Batman

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
well like sneaking around in Batman

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.970 
well like sneaking around in Batman
but<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.820> better<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.750> don't<00:02:15.230> know<00:02:15.380> why<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:15.620> I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
but just better I don't know why but I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.920 
but just better I don't know why but I
just<00:02:16.070> enjoyed<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.060> stealth<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.690> game

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
just enjoyed the stealth in this game

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.410 
just enjoyed the stealth in this game
much<00:02:18.380> more<00:02:18.670> maybe<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.850> because<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.300> like

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
much more maybe it's because I like

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470 
much more maybe it's because I like
spider-man<00:02:21.200> more<00:02:21.680> maybe<00:02:22.550> it's<00:02:22.790> because<00:02:23.060> when

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
spider-man more maybe it's because when

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.420 
spider-man more maybe it's because when
I<00:02:23.510> knock<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.110> people<00:02:24.530> from<00:02:24.710> above<00:02:25.010> they<00:02:25.220> don't

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
I knock out people from above they don't

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.820 
I knock out people from above they don't
scream<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.180> attract<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.750> guards<00:02:27.320> or

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
scream and attract all the guards or

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.340 
scream and attract all the guards or
maybe<00:02:28.490> it's<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.060> artistic<00:02:29.720> style<00:02:30.020> the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
maybe it's just the artistic style the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.380 
maybe it's just the artistic style the
whole<00:02:30.530> concept<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.700> whatever<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.270> is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
whole concept but whatever it is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.900 
whole concept but whatever it is
something<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.200> noir<00:02:33.590> spider-man<00:02:33.800> hits<00:02:34.700> me

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
something with noir spider-man hits me

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.690 
something with noir spider-man hits me
at<00:02:35.030> home<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.170> love<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.220> best<00:02:37.520> bit
