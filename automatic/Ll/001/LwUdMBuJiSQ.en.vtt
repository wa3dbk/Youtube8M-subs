control<00:00:17.930> of<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.170> locomotives<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:19.190> achieved

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
control of the locomotives is achieved

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.210 
control of the locomotives is achieved
by<00:00:19.820> using<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:20.360> infrared<00:00:20.780> and<00:00:21.140> radio<00:00:21.680> control

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
by using the infrared and radio control

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.460 
by using the infrared and radio control
system<00:00:22.670> devised<00:00:23.300> by<00:00:23.570> Steve<00:00:23.870> Leyland<00:00:24.320> and

marketed under the name of red arrow the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.560 
marketed under the name of red arrow the
principle<00:00:31.280> attraction<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.820> red<00:00:32.029> arrow<00:00:32.210> is

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
principle attraction of red arrow is

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.200 
principle attraction of red arrow is
