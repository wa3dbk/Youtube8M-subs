diameter is 3 inches so your your
there's<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.509> summary<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.169> ways<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.800> do

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
there's a summary different ways to do

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.540 
there's a summary different ways to do
this<00:00:33.050> basically<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.890> looking<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.280> do

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this basically what you're looking to do

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
this basically what you're looking to do
is<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:38.780> determine<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.199> bearing

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is is determine what the bearing

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.360 
is is determine what the bearing
clearance<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.809> want<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.800> two

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
clearance is because you want about two

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.170 
clearance is because you want about two
and<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> half<00:00:44.730> thousand<00:00:45.390> three<00:00:46.199> inch<00:00:46.379> shaft<00:00:47.180> in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and a half thousand three inch shaft in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.619 
and a half thousand three inch shaft in
order<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.920> prevent<00:00:50.480> any<00:00:51.480> problems<00:00:51.870> with

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
order to to prevent any problems with

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.119 
order to to prevent any problems with
bearings<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.840> high<00:00:54.989> speeds<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.769> don't<00:00:55.980> want

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
bearings at high speeds you don't want

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
bearings at high speeds you don't want
you<00:00:56.250> don't<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> blow<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> bearings<00:00:57.239> out

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you don't want to blow the bearings out

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
you don't want to blow the bearings out
or<00:00:57.600> anything<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.019> so<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> need<00:00:58.769> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
or anything like that so you need to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.569 
or anything like that so you need to
need<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.660> ensure<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
need to ensure that you have and if you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
need to ensure that you have and if you
look<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:04.530> each<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
look at this you can see it's each one

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359 
look at this you can see it's each one
of<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.670> big<00:01:05.970> marks<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:07.170> thousand<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.280> we

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of those big marks is one thousand so we

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.350 
of those big marks is one thousand so we
got<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:09.030> thousand

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
got about two thousand

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.250 
got about two thousand
two<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.170> half<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:12.800> you<00:01:12.890> go<00:01:13.070> back<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.520> forth

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
two and a half so you go back and forth

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.660 
two and a half so you go back and forth
until<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.650> see<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.130> maybe<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.400> see<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
until you see that maybe you see the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.880 
until you see that maybe you see the
minimum<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.990> just<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.410> little<00:01:18.590> under

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
minimum there it's just a little under

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.590 
minimum there it's just a little under
two<00:01:19.690> which<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.840> about<00:01:21.080> right<00:01:21.320> because<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
two which is about right because the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
two which is about right because the
bearing<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.670> crankshaft<00:01:25.670> itself<00:01:26.480> will<00:01:27.380> add

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
bearing the crankshaft itself will add

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.640 
bearing the crankshaft itself will add
another<00:01:28.360> half<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.510> thousands<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> thousand

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
another half of thousands to a thousand

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.640 
another half of thousands to a thousand
and<00:01:31.540> that'll<00:01:32.540> give<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> round<00:01:33.170> two<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
and that'll give you a round two and a

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.680 
and that'll give you a round two and a
half<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.979> three<00:01:34.150> which<00:01:35.150> is<00:01:35.180> what<00:01:35.540> you're

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
half to three which is what you're

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.500 
half to three which is what you're
looking<00:01:35.780> for<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.190> have<00:01:37.370> free<00:01:37.820> screaming

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
looking for and we have free screaming

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.790 
looking for and we have free screaming
kids<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.900> background<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.950> help<00:01:41.680> what's<00:01:42.680> a

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
kids in the background we help what's a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.310 
kids in the background we help what's a
little<00:01:43.010> hillbilly<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.090> that's<00:01:44.360> what<00:01:44.930> that's

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
little hillbilly so that's what that's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.810 
little hillbilly so that's what that's
what<00:01:45.560> we're<00:01:45.710> doing<00:01:46.009> now<00:01:46.160> each<00:01:46.369> one<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.640> these

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
what we're doing now each one of these

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.960 
what we're doing now each one of these
bearings<00:01:47.810> are<00:01:48.020> 350<00:01:48.770> long<00:01:49.040> Windsor's<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.520> if

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
bearings are 350 long Windsor's is if

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.510 
bearings are 350 long Windsor's is if
you<00:01:50.210> want<00:01:50.450> approximately<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.320> same<00:01:51.619> diameter

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
you want approximately the same diameter

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.820 
you want approximately the same diameter
so<00:01:53.509> bearings<00:01:54.410> one<00:01:54.710> two<00:01:55.869> four<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:56.899> five<00:01:57.440> are

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
so bearings one two four and five are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.130 
so bearings one two four and five are
going<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.130> be<00:01:58.220> identically<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.210> shells<00:01:59.899> are

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
going to be identically the shells are

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.420 
going to be identically the shells are
the<00:02:00.200> same<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.770> holes<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.250> same

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the same the holes are the same

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.460 
the same the holes are the same
everything<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.940> same<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.930> thrust<00:02:03.259> is

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
everything is the same the thrust is

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.460 
everything is the same the thrust is
data<00:02:03.860> forward<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.399> taken<00:02:04.729> up<00:02:04.820> with<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.119> center

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
data forward is taken up with the center

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.400 
data forward is taken up with the center
bearing<00:02:06.470> here<00:02:06.830> number<00:02:07.009> three<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:08.450> we'll<00:02:08.810> go

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
bearing here number three then we'll go

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.990 
bearing here number three then we'll go
through<00:02:09.440> another<00:02:09.920> video<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.280> how<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.640> line

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
through another video on how to line

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.330 
through another video on how to line
those<00:02:11.239> up<00:02:11.300> when<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.810> put<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.080> crank<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.560> you

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
those up when you put the crank in you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.860 
those up when you put the crank in you
take<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.730> crank<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.330> hit<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.630> crank

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
take the crank and you hit the crank

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.640 
take the crank and you hit the crank
hard<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.190> being<00:02:16.760> just<00:02:17.150> smoke<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.840> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
hard with this being just smoke and it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.699 
hard with this being just smoke and it
lines<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.030> flange<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.260> can<00:02:21.320> see<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
lines the flange is up you can see the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.199 
lines the flange is up you can see the
thrust<00:02:21.980> flanges<00:02:22.340> here<00:02:22.489> they<00:02:22.610> got<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> copper

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
thrust flanges here they got a copper

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.890 
thrust flanges here they got a copper
plating<00:02:23.750> on<00:02:23.900> them<00:02:24.019> here<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.160> side<00:02:25.900> you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
plating on them here on the side you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.449 
plating on them here on the side you
probably<00:02:27.140> should<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.709> stronger<00:02:28.130> light<00:02:28.310> on

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
probably should put a stronger light on

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.880 
probably should put a stronger light on
this<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:29.120> anyway<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.959> could<00:02:30.140> see<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> copper

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
this but anyway you could see the copper

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.250 
this but anyway you could see the copper
here<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.760> there's<00:02:31.940> little<00:02:32.180> slats<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
here and there's little slats for the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.050 
here and there's little slats for the
oil<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.560> come<00:02:33.709> out<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.220> want<00:02:34.519> these<00:02:34.760> two

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
oil to come out you want these two

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.350 
oil to come out you want these two
flanges<00:02:35.830> lined<00:02:36.830> up

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
flanges lined up

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.800

because<00:02:39.080> when<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.440> push<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.830> clutch<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.810> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
because when you push the clutch in the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.380 
because when you push the clutch in the
pressure<00:02:42.110> plate<00:02:42.500> tries<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.580> push<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.000> crank<00:02:44.240> a

it's<00:02:47.540> not<00:02:47.840> as<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:48.980> critical<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.030> stick<00:02:50.390> shift

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
it's not as as critical on a stick shift

it's not as as critical on a stick shift
car<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.500> definitely<00:02:52.010> want<00:02:52.190> these<00:02:52.340> lined<00:02:52.610> up

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
car you definitely want these lined up

car you definitely want these lined up
and<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:54.590> pretty<00:02:54.830> much<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.190> story<00:02:57.160> are

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
and that's pretty much the story are

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160 
and that's pretty much the story are
these<00:02:58.340> torque<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.420> accessibility

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170

these<00:03:00.620> these<00:03:01.400> are<00:03:01.460> ARP<00:03:03.250> main<00:03:04.250> stud<00:03:04.580> bolts<00:03:04.780> they

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
these these are ARP main stud bolts they

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.740 
these these are ARP main stud bolts they
use<00:03:05.990> this<00:03:06.140> they<00:03:06.410> use<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> special<00:03:07.490> steel<00:03:08.330> ibiza

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
use this they use a special steel ibiza

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.510 
use this they use a special steel ibiza
this<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.170> two<00:03:09.320> hundred<00:03:09.650> thousand<00:03:10.070> pounds

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
this is two hundred thousand pounds

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.030 
this is two hundred thousand pounds
tensile<00:03:11.240> strength<00:03:11.510> which<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.810> probably<00:03:12.200> my

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
tensile strength which is probably my

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.220 
tensile strength which is probably my
guess<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.520> at<00:03:13.700> least<00:03:14.000> twice<00:03:14.510> as<00:03:14.720> good<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:14.990> stock

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
guess is at least twice as good as stock

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
guess is at least twice as good as stock
and<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.430> stud<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.360> remember<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.810> a

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
and a stud you have to remember that a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.550 
and a stud you have to remember that a
stud<00:03:18.580> divides<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.970> torque<00:03:20.270> remember<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.410> got

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
stud divides the torque remember you got

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.860 
stud divides the torque remember you got
you<00:03:21.950> got<00:03:22.130> two<00:03:22.340> threaded<00:03:22.760> surfaces<00:03:23.270> on<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> cap

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you got two threaded surfaces on a cap

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.080 
you got two threaded surfaces on a cap
screw<00:03:24.260> if<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.250> look<00:03:25.400> at<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.550> standard<00:03:25.760> cap

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090

screw if you look at a standard cap
screw<00:03:26.270> there's<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.510> head<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:28.010> it's

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
screw there's a head on it and then it's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.880 
screw there's a head on it and then it's
threaded<00:03:28.640> right<00:03:28.820> into<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.240> block<00:03:29.450> on<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.350> stud

threaded right into the block on a stud

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.940 
threaded right into the block on a stud
you're<00:03:31.610> dividing<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.450> torque<00:03:32.750> between<00:03:33.740> these

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
you're dividing the torque between these

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.010 
you're dividing the torque between these
threads<00:03:34.340> or<00:03:34.670> these<00:03:35.000> threads<00:03:35.330> here<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.810> see

these things are fine now fine threads
take<00:03:38.750> torque<00:03:39.290> load<00:03:39.590> much<00:03:40.070> better<00:03:40.430> than

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
take torque load much better than

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.080 
take torque load much better than
coarseness<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.800> that's<00:03:43.310> why<00:03:43.550> people<00:03:43.910> usually

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
coarseness so that's why people usually

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.820 
coarseness so that's why people usually
say<00:03:44.450> up<00:03:44.600> here<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:45.019> stuff<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.440> makes<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
say up here and stuff it makes the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.759 
say up here and stuff it makes the
bottom<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.310> much<00:03:47.120> more<00:03:47.390> secure<00:03:47.840> stuff

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
bottom in much more secure stuff

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
don't want to be collecting sundry

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.250 
don't want to be collecting sundry
reciprocating<00:03:56.209> parts<00:03:56.360> from<00:03:56.600> your<00:03:56.810> backside

that yeah if you'll notice too we have

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.540 
that yeah if you'll notice too we have
to<00:04:10.660> cut<00:04:11.660> some<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.900> these<00:04:12.050> furs<00:04:12.500> yeah<00:04:12.890> we'll<00:04:13.400> go

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
to cut some of these furs yeah we'll go

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.720 
to cut some of these furs yeah we'll go
through<00:04:13.760> another<00:04:14.030> video<00:04:14.420> will<00:04:14.750> show<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.050> how

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
through another video will show you how

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.729 
through another video will show you how
you<00:04:16.730> have<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.269> fit<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.750> windage<00:04:18.080> tray<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.620> can

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
you have to fit the windage tray you can

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.070 
you have to fit the windage tray you can
see<00:04:18.980> some<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.310> these<00:04:19.370> studs<00:04:19.730> were<00:04:19.880> cut<00:04:20.120> the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
see some of these studs were cut the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.770 
see some of these studs were cut the
pickup<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> on<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.190> 351<00:04:22.940> Windsor<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.600> goes

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.360 
fox body the way the cross members are
they<00:04:34.860> had<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.220> go<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.639> rear<00:04:35.970> side<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.680> we<00:04:38.220> had

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
they had to go to a rear side so we had

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.570 
they had to go to a rear side so we had
to<00:04:38.490> modify<00:04:38.699> some<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.240> these<00:04:39.620> these<00:04:40.620> ARP<00:04:41.250> studs

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
to modify some of these these ARP studs

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.520 
to modify some of these these ARP studs
but<00:04:41.760> basically<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.449> windage<00:04:42.780> tray<00:04:42.810> goes<00:04:43.290> on

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
but basically the windage tray goes on

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.129 
but basically the windage tray goes on
these<00:04:43.680> four<00:04:44.150> step-down<00:04:45.150> studs<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:45.960> see

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
these four step-down studs you can see

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.129 
these four step-down studs you can see
here<00:04:46.669> this<00:04:47.669> Center<00:04:48.090> stud<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.960> oil

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
here this Center stud is for the oil

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.629 
here this Center stud is for the oil
pump<00:04:49.440> pickup<00:04:49.590> when<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.010> oil<00:04:50.130> pump<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.490> course

pump pickup when the oil pump of course

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.730 
pump pickup when the oil pump of course
is<00:04:50.760> over<00:04:51.000> here<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.780> then<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.050> pickup<00:04:52.350> goes<00:04:52.560> to

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
is over here and then the pickup goes to

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.530 
is over here and then the pickup goes to
the<00:04:52.830> bathroom<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.669> then<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> bottom<00:04:54.389> of<00:04:54.449> the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
pants were here and we're gonna we're

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.120 
pants were here and we're gonna we're
gonna<00:04:57.870> go<00:04:58.110> ahead<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.440> check<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.800> rest<00:04:58.949> of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
gonna go ahead and check the rest of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.930 
gonna go ahead and check the rest of
these<00:04:59.190> bearings<00:04:59.699> then<00:05:00.690> we're<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:01.440> to

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
these bearings then we're going to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.230 
these bearings then we're going to
attend<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.060> crank<00:05:03.330> clean<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.080> oil<00:05:04.110> holes<00:05:04.560> and

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
attend the crank clean the oil holes and

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.480 
attend the crank clean the oil holes and
put<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.360> rear<00:05:06.539> seal<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.350> put<00:05:08.310> our

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
put the rear seal in and put our

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.939 
put the rear seal in and put our
lubricant<00:05:09.389> in<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.750> lure<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.500> dog<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.889> there

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
lubricant in and lure the dog in there

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.650 
lubricant in and lure the dog in there
how<00:05:13.949> critical<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:15.000> check<00:05:15.330> bearing

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
how critical is it to check bearing

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.850 
how critical is it to check bearing
clearances<00:05:16.169> when<00:05:16.320> you're<00:05:16.440> building<00:05:16.620> an

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
clearances when you're building an

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.610 
clearances when you're building an
engine<00:05:17.010> bearing<00:05:17.580> clearances<00:05:18.120> are<00:05:18.620> very

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
engine bearing clearances are very

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.180 
engine bearing clearances are very
critical

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
critical

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.100 
critical
the<00:05:20.820> reason<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.360> if<00:05:21.660> you<00:05:21.810> you're

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
the reason is that if you you're

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.600 
the reason is that if you you're
building<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.560> high-performance<00:05:23.250> engine

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
building a high-performance engine

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.439 
building a high-performance engine
you're<00:05:24.510> putting<00:05:24.870> two<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.169> three<00:05:25.560> times<00:05:26.449> the

you're putting two and three times the

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.870 
you're putting two and three times the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
make provisions for better oil flow more

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.219 
make provisions for better oil flow more
lubrication<00:05:41.849> because<00:05:42.450> you've<00:05:42.570> got<00:05:42.690> much<00:05:43.020> more

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
lubrication because you've got much more

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.800 
lubrication because you've got much more
load<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:44.370> each<00:05:44.610> piston<00:05:44.910> instead<00:05:45.450> of<00:05:45.539> putting

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
load so each piston instead of putting

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.339 
load so each piston instead of putting
out<00:05:45.979> maybe<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.450> you've<00:05:48.599> got<00:05:48.720> eight<00:05:48.960> eight

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
out maybe just so you've got eight eight

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.330 
out maybe just so you've got eight eight
times<00:05:50.810> eight<00:05:51.810> times

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
times eight times

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.090 
times eight times
30<00:05:53.970> say<00:05:54.720> about<00:05:54.960> 30<00:05:55.260> horse<00:05:55.470> of<00:05:55.650> pista<00:05:55.980> and

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
30 say about 30 horse of pista and

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.820 
30 say about 30 horse of pista and
roughly<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:56.970> 8<00:05:57.120> times<00:05:57.360> 3<00:05:57.540> would<00:05:57.630> be<00:05:57.750> 240<00:05:58.320> that's

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
roughly so 8 times 3 would be 240 that's

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.730 
roughly so 8 times 3 would be 240 that's
roughly<00:05:59.160> a<00:05:59.250> stock<00:05:59.550> more<00:05:59.780> 200<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.870> 240<00:06:01.410> horse

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
roughly a stock more 200 to 240 horse

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.190 
roughly a stock more 200 to 240 horse
when<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:02.460> start<00:06:02.760> getting<00:06:03.090> up<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.390> 50<00:06:03.870> horses

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
when you start getting up to 50 horses

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.980 
when you start getting up to 50 horses
cylinder<00:06:04.710> so<00:06:04.890> 58<00:06:05.760> times<00:06:06.090> five<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.390> one<00:06:06.780> four

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
cylinder so 58 times five is one four

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.190 
cylinder so 58 times five is one four
hundred<00:06:07.260> eight<00:06:07.980> times<00:06:08.340> six<00:06:08.730> is<00:06:09.090> four<00:06:09.900> hundred

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
hundred eight times six is four hundred

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.420 
hundred eight times six is four hundred
eighty<00:06:10.350> eight<00:06:10.650> times<00:06:11.610> seven<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.920> 420<00:06:13.920> don't

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
eighty eight times seven is 420 don't

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.270 
eighty eight times seven is 420 don't
wait<00:06:14.550> what's<00:06:14.850> a<00:06:14.970> time<00:06:15.150> set<00:06:15.390> 56<00:06:16.260> eight<00:06:16.830> times<00:06:17.100> so

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
wait what's a time set 56 eight times so

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.180 
wait what's a time set 56 eight times so
that's<00:06:18.060> right<00:06:18.300> 56<00:06:18.960> so<00:06:19.590> you're<00:06:19.800> looking<00:06:19.890> at

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
that's right 56 so you're looking at

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.640 
that's right 56 so you're looking at
that<00:06:20.640> kind<00:06:20.940> of<00:06:21.090> power<00:06:21.330> per<00:06:21.750> soldier<00:06:22.080> thank<00:06:22.500> so

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
that kind of power per soldier thank so

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.930 
that kind of power per soldier thank so
bill<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:23.010> you<00:06:23.040> can<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.520> can<00:06:23.730> see<00:06:24.030> that<00:06:25.940> each

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
bill so you can you can see that each

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.470 
bill so you can you can see that each
piston<00:06:27.270> is<00:06:27.600> pushing<00:06:28.260> much<00:06:28.650> higher<00:06:29.120> than<00:06:30.120> the
