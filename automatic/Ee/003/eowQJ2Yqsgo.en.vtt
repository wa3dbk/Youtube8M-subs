00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700 
should set the notes now a little bit
high<00:01:43.880> due<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.479> pitch<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.079> you<00:01:45.200> know<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
high due to the pitch it you know the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.170 
high due to the pitch it you know the
pitching<00:01:46.189> of<00:01:46.280> samples<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.670> always<00:01:46.850> relative

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
pitching of samples is always relative

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.600 
pitching of samples is always relative
to<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.479> pitch<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.659> goes<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.860> I'm<00:01:49.460> just

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
to the pitch that goes in so I'm just

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.130 
to the pitch that goes in so I'm just
going<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.790> transpose<00:01:50.299> that<00:01:50.540> down<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> little

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
going to transpose that down a little

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.179 
going to transpose that down a little
bit<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:51.740> get<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.310> slightly<00:01:52.670> better<00:01:53.530> range<00:01:54.530> here

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
bit and get a slightly better range here

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.250 
bit and get a slightly better range here
there<00:01:55.939> we<00:01:56.060> go<00:01:56.240> so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
there we go so

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.440 
there we go so
that's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.400> better<00:01:59.730> I<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.060> hear<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that's a bit better I can hear that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's a bit better I can hear that
nicely<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:01.440> there<00:02:01.770> I've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:01.980> my<00:02:02.430> notes<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:03.090> and
