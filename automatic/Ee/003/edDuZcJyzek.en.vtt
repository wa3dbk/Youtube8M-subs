for more than probably ghosts I mean
ghosts<00:04:47.080> I<00:04:47.230> think<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.560> intention<00:04:47.920> span<00:04:48.250> with

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
ghosts I think the intention span with

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.750 
ghosts I think the intention span with
ghosts<00:04:48.700> was<00:04:48.970> maybe<00:04:49.930> like<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.230> month<00:04:50.760> honestly

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
ghosts was maybe like a month honestly

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.310 
ghosts was maybe like a month honestly
before<00:04:52.120> people<00:04:52.390> really<00:04:52.630> started<00:04:52.900> trading<00:04:53.140> it

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.770 
before people really started trading it
in<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.620> think<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.340> think<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.850> think<00:04:55.360> advanced

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
in I think I think I think advanced

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.260 
in I think I think I think advanced
warfare<00:04:56.080> will<00:04:56.290> last<00:04:56.500> until<00:04:56.940> probably<00:04:57.940> March
