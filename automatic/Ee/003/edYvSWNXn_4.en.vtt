00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:34.059 
my head I think it's a if you look at

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.999 
my head I think it's a if you look at
the<00:04:34.089> Hot<00:04:34.269> Wheels<00:04:34.449> box<00:04:34.689> it's<00:04:34.959> a<00:04:35.049> yellow<00:04:35.289> tip<00:04:35.739> and

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
the Hot Wheels box it's a yellow tip and

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.519 
the Hot Wheels box it's a yellow tip and
