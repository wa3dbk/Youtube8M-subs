except for arrows and fire charges and
that<00:02:36.520> all<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.510> if<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.530> when<00:02:38.920> i<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.550> i<00:02:39.640> use

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
that all that I if I when i use it i use

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.820 
that all that I if I when i use it i use
the<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.450> because<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.959> get<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.170> lot<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.530> it

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
the right because you get a lot of it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.760 
the right because you get a lot of it
and<00:02:42.070> it's<00:02:42.570> pretty<00:02:43.570> much<00:02:43.720> useless<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.770> just

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
and it's pretty much useless so just

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.390 
and it's pretty much useless so just
activated<00:02:48.520> then<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.480> will<00:02:49.690> shoot<00:02:50.080> out<00:02:50.260> at<00:02:50.980> an

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
activated then it will shoot out at an

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.060 
activated then it will shoot out at an
item<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.720> get<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.530> land<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
item and then get it to land on the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.259 
item and then get it to land on the
pressure<00:02:54.310> plate<00:02:54.780> when<00:02:55.780> deciding<00:02:56.140> these<00:02:56.590> bones

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
pressure plate when deciding these bones

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.740 
pressure plate when deciding these bones
after<00:02:58.269> five<00:02:58.540> minutes<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.500> will<00:03:00.420> give<00:03:01.420> up<00:03:01.570> a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
after five minutes it will give up a

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.940 
after five minutes it will give up a
pulse<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.519> shoot<00:03:04.390> another<00:03:04.720> one<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.350> that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
pulse and shoot another one and that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.990 
pulse and shoot another one and that
pulse<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.910> want<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.299> use<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.870> activate<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
pulse we want to use to activate the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.009 
pulse we want to use to activate the
Pistons<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.620> take<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> redstone<00:03:12.640> wire<00:03:13.030> go

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
Pistons so just take a redstone wire go

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.350 
Pistons so just take a redstone wire go
to<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.250> redstone<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:15.940> have<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.299> top<00:03:16.570> here<00:03:16.930> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
to the redstone we have on top here and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.460 
to the redstone we have on top here and
then<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.510> can<00:03:19.690> see<00:03:19.930> them<00:03:20.890> extend<00:03:22.470> until

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
then you can see them extend until

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:32.610 
then you can see them extend until
another<00:03:24.340> item<00:03:24.700> land<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:26.040> veggie<00:03:27.040> plate<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
another item land on the veggie plate so

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:41.380 
another item land on the veggie plate so
now<00:03:32.860> we<00:03:32.920> want<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.310> plan<00:03:33.730> our<00:03:34.150> our<00:03:34.810> sugar<00:03:35.380> canes

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.580 

and<00:03:42.390> when<00:03:42.630> they<00:03:42.840> grow<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:46.350> will<00:03:46.530> be<00:03:46.710> harvested

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
and when they grow it will be harvested

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.430 
and when they grow it will be harvested
so<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:49.830> we<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.250> want<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.640> create<00:03:51.240> our<00:03:51.570> our

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
so now we just want to create our our

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.420 
so now we just want to create our our
water<00:03:53.250> streams<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:54.180> will<00:03:54.420> transport<00:03:54.840> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
water streams that will transport the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:13.490 
water streams that will transport the
sugarcane<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.790> us<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:10.080> be<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:12.500> echoed

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
sugarcane to us it can be this is echoed

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.520 
sugarcane to us it can be this is echoed
examples<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.520> can<00:04:14.700> see<00:04:14.940> when<00:04:15.209> we<00:04:15.530> only

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
examples so you can see when we only

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.000 
examples so you can see when we only
prob<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:18.660> sugarcanes<00:04:19.260> they<00:04:19.680> will<00:04:19.859> get

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
prob the sugarcanes they will get

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.840 
prob the sugarcanes they will get
transferred<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> then<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.640> just

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
transferred here so then you can just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.690 
transferred here so then you can just
stand<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.330> here<00:04:24.930> AFK<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.710> wait<00:04:28.980> for<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
stand here here AFK and wait for the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.090 
stand here here AFK and wait for the
show<00:04:30.060> games<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.630> grow<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.200> automatically

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
show games to grow and we automatically

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.950 
show games to grow and we automatically
harvested<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.610> can<00:04:35.760> see<00:04:35.940> here<00:04:38.900> some<00:04:39.900> of

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
harvested so you can see here some of

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.500 
harvested so you can see here some of
the<00:04:40.140> sugarcanes<00:04:40.860> will<00:04:41.310> land<00:04:42.030> on<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.480> ground

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
the sugarcanes will land on the ground

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.700 
the sugarcanes will land on the ground
but<00:04:43.440> most<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.100> will<00:04:44.310> go<00:04:44.490> into<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.910> water

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
but most of it will go into the water

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.030 
but most of it will go into the water
and<00:04:46.710> then<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.550> just<00:04:47.729> pick<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.000> up<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.530> as

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
and then you can just pick it up so as

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.760 
and then you can just pick it up so as
long<00:04:50.340> at<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.729> as<00:04:51.330> long<00:04:51.600> as<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.810> have<00:04:52.050> items<00:04:52.350> in

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
long at you as long as you have items in

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.850 
long at you as long as you have items in
here<00:04:53.160> this<00:04:53.580> will<00:04:53.790> be<00:04:53.940> active<00:04:54.479> a<00:04:54.720> way<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.440> can

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
here this will be active a way you can

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.670 
here this will be active a way you can
turn<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.190> off<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.669> by<00:04:56.910> raising<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.960> lever<00:04:58.260> here

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
turn it off is by raising a lever here

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.469 
turn it off is by raising a lever here
and<00:04:59.330> turning<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.450> on<00:05:00.630> now<00:05:01.790> it<00:05:02.790> will<00:05:03.060> stop

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
and turning it on now it will stop

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.850 
and turning it on now it will stop
shooting<00:05:04.080> until<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.710> flip<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.640> lever<00:05:06.270> again

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
shooting until you flip the lever again

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:16.070 
shooting until you flip the lever again
even<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:12.410> yeah<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.710> hope<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.760> to<00:05:15.030> show<00:05:15.300> that
