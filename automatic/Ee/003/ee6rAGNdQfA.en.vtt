00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
 hello my name is andré borges and today I 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.100
 I wanted to vent 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.180
 A lot of people do not know but I record videos. 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.360
 forbidden tube 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.910
 commenting on a manga called bissio humor 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.210
 Who does not know what manga is? I'll go. 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.599
 simplify for you long is reviewed in 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.029
 japan comics but it's a lot 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.860
 different from the comic books that 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.090
 We have here in Brazil as a class of 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.579
 monica for example 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.570
 but then I make these videos about 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.460
 this manga 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.039
 I make the chapters that come out 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.800
 weekly I make theories about the 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.289
 story and a few other things 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.929
 but I'm very ashamed to record 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.539
 when there are other people near 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:53.660
 me and me too, I'm ashamed to speak 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.679
 that I record this kind of video and then 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.629
 today I wondered why I did not 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.460
 I'm doing nothing wrong because I 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 should be ashamed of it 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.710
 quite the opposite, I'm 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.110
 doing a very good thing since I 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.260
 I make videos for the joy of several 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.650
 people generally a thousand people who 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.350
 watch and they love my videos 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.020
 I know this because she always leaves 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.410
 great comments on my videos and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.380
 always come back to watch more then 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.530
 they continue watching means 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.320
 they like it then again I wonder 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.390
 because I'm ashamed of it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.790
 For a long time I thought I 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.300
 I was ashamed of the wind to receive 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.630
 Criticism as our most became childish 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.830
 That's the phrase I've heard some 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.010
 times but will be childish even removed 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.140
 another who is the author of a vice is not 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.230
 considered childish by what it does 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.010
 So why would I be childish? 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.990
 I do 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.340
 some people have already told me that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.159
 It's a waste of time 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.560
 Yes, I admit I lose a good time. 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.450
 doing this but the return is wonderful 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 to see people from different 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.940
 world enjoying something so much 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 you tried so hard to make 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.349
 It's great, so the time I lose 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.250
 in the end it ends up being worth a lot 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.000
 feather 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.900
 but once again that question comes back 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 to me because I'm ashamed of it 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.660
 I honestly do not know, I think 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.970
 I should be proud of what I do. 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.610
 So shame because like I said 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.269
 Before, I'm not doing anything 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.849
 wrong 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.129
 Quite the contrary, I 'm doing it. 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.440
 a very good thing 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.370
 If you doubt that what I do is a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.250
 good thing 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 eg there are four or five videos that I 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.510
 already liked 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.890
 read some comments if you have the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.200
 minimum of compassion 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 you will feel that these people who 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.209
 They like me very much and I like 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.680
 a lot of them mainly for the affection 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.170
 What do they have for me? 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.209
 had a moment of my life that I 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.190
 was experiencing some problems and 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.810
 I commented on this in one of the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.940
 my videos 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.260
 the response I had from people who 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.109
 assist me 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.420
 it was simply sensational every 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.790
 comment I was reading was as if the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.700
 The pain I felt inside me 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.459
 the Ciço Mindu every comment I would me 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.829
 feeling much better here was like a 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.430
 therapy for me and I do not know what I 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.380
 would have done without those comments 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.709
 of those people who watch me 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.549
 but anyway I'll try to change it from here 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.709
 forward 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 I'll try to feel less shame than 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.160
 what I do 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.380
 maybe I might get no but the fact 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.660
 and I'll try and if someday 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.310
 Someone criticizes me because of the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.580
 my videos 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.790
 I'll just stop and think about it. 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.260
 I do it because I like it because it is 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:12.300
 does very well who knows, thinking the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.300
 My life does not change for the better.
