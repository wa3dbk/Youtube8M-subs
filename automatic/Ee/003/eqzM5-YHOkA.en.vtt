00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.780
 the greatest proponents of flamenco a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.000
 most popular flamenco that was encouraged 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 include influences from other genres 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 like jazz, rock, pop, which is why 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 he was accused I remember piazzolla k was 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.399

 memorable also in the 80's was 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530

 to two great guitars of the world 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.399
