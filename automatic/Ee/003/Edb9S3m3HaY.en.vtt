 it's a very good rom the truth 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.970
 let's like how to install 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.560
 I do not know how to search available all together 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.560

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.039
 here one gets l 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.190
 as we will see 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.190
 innovate 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.690
 at dawn 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.649
 In the next 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.170

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 It is very good 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.539
 as it looks a lot like the original the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.289
 truth is almost the same but if they have 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.289
 other things 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.380
 In block 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.480
 let's explain 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.990
 and the first thing I wanted to teach you is a 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.230
 screen lot that comes configured only 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.170

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.960
 screen lock locks

 the living lots that activate it 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.020
 It is very good 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.540
 and the truth is much greater than a lot 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.050
 in an application 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.660
 as beneficial unblock google and the 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.660

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.880
 of it but as you already know they can

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.330
 climate to give them the weather but 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.360
 they have to have internet like having a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.360
 data plan that is on 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.270

 it works with a command to wake up 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.420
 I opened camera or whether they can put what 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.560
 four of line 04 but the truth is 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.590

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.160
