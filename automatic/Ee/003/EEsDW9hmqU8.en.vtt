00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.040
 and we started 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.700
 for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.950
 very good kids one more day for the 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.010
 channel and today you will see me a little happier 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.470
 normal and it's because I've just been 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.020
 dad and do not be scared do not go to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.450
 channel of me to congratulate you 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.309
 because not yet to a frame in this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 I have been a father in photographic matters 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 because I have a new member of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.480
 family let's say that my backpack has a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.630
 New room 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
 tun tun and here are new kids 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.650
 member of the family could be said to 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 the head of the family and well then here 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.150
 we are and this video is not about unam 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.430
 boxing that you will have 10,000 on YouTube 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.379
 is going to over the camera although of course 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.030
 I'm thinking of doing one but that 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.500
 is going for something curious and what has happened to me 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.570
 by sharing in the networks that I had 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 bought each new camera and they are the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.600
 typical comments of finally you pass 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.150
 to nicon you know what to use 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.479
 this brand or play this brand is better 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 that the other one that is the mythical war 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.100
 between photographers and I want to take advantage 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.960
 then this time to tell you my 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.539
 point of view about the topic because 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.100
 it seems that many people do not share it 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.570
 this point of view and I say well 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 I'm going to make a blog to see what you think 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.310
 to my subscribers and this video though 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.289
 It seems I do not want to make it eternal 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.050
 so I'll get to the point and as you already 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.479
 I said let's talk about why this 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.310
 mark and not the other this the other to see you 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.320
 story and I have had many brands 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.470
 since I started in photography I started 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.110
 by sonny I was with I had three cameras 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.810
 the 200 the 320 and the 5 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.000
 5 I loved the three cameras are a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.590
 design I find the host in materials 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.110
 I think it's the best thing I've tried in 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.120
 my life but then I went to canon 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
 because I went here I did not want to go full 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.500
 frame and by that time of 800 alpha 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.540
 800 is beyond my budget 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 only one that had access was a 5 de marc 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.259
 2 what I did at that time I said oh I'm going 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 change my brand I'll go to the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.060
 canon shit and much less I never said 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.100
 you get a canon I'm going to try a canon 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.930
 and since I went for my 5 of which 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.840
 I had a lot of time too and which 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.160
 it was super good I had it a year and a half or two 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.840
 years and without complaint good canon that went through 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
 that time, I was already 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.600
 nikon's comments are better than 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.430
 700 nikon is the host blah blah blah 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.230
 a lot of those people who said that now 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.870
 still not working from this I'm 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.780
 working on this and without continuing with full 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.060
 frame because of the 5d I passed to the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.709
 olympus that a lot of people said there 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.630
 I hate so many people said oh the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.180
 itbis but if canon and nikon are the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.819
 host and with a lot of sonning how are you going 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.019
 olympus after olympus or md one 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.670
 recording this video with which I've 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.379
 recorded all the videos of the channel is the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.969
 Host the vinegar host in vinegar 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.769
 I still keep it for sure because 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.040
 Many of you have also asked in 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.079
 camera that I will take next to the 810 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.030
 now and that I do not plan to sell because I 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.549
 it seems a camera pass a camera 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.010
 tiny material is flippant is 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.129
 incredible quality all my works of 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.530
 year ago for here they are with that camera and 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.689
 without any complaint olympus the host in 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.719
 vinegar and because now neither with then look 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.700
 now or in the following because 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.349
 I needed a camera that would give me so much 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.450
 the image quality that I need to 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.489
 certain jobs that I'm at 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.859
 level that I am working now as a 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.449
 the time a professional video since 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.370
 I'm also getting a lot of work 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.379
 on video and I did not feel like having a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.180
 good camera and a good camera 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.650
 video separately if you are willing 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.469
 in the world of photography you will know that 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.409
 to this day nor with 810 is perfection 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.449
 at the level of having photography and video in 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.069
 the same camera in the same body and in 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.049
 No time I said the pussy I'm going to 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.960
 happen to neither with nor with what I hate or with is 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.910
 fucking shit 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.340
 no no I did that on the contrary Save 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.380
 my pasta and I went I bought a nikon and 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.360
 with this is already the fourth chamber of the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.730
 fourth camera brand that tests and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.290
 delighted with it and possibly the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.880
 next camera that I bought to better 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.250
 be a fujifilm because I am 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.980
 casting the eye or hopefully a 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.990
 hasselblad but that I doubt it and in the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.480
 day I'm going to buy this camera 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.760
 I will go online to the forums to see 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.770
 who puts to birth who therefore 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.450
 guys and what I was going to answer with 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.780
 this video to all the questions that I 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.750
 you are doing so much of Juan that camera 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.610
 I buy that brand I buy myself why 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.200
 you have gone from this mark to the other or 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.380
 what have you done with olympus it or of 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.360
 this the answer would be all the olympus 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.980
 I keep keeping it measured neither with 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.110
 simply because it was the camera to day 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.840
 today that offered me everything that 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.790
 needed and precisely for that and what 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.800
 that I always tell you is the best camera 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.690
 for me so when you go to 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.010
 buy us a camera think you want 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.139
 think if you want photos if you want 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.080
 videos if you want data things search 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.090
 options on all brands taking into 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.699
 account about everything you need and 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.479
 things like what range of objectives have 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.849
 at what price are etcetera etcetera and 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.159
 buy what best suits you 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.319
 because in the end the best brand is going to be 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.210
 your name because when someone is 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.639
 good when they tell me certain 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.129
 names that I know I do not ask 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.529
 what camera will this photo have made me 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.479
 I do not ask what brand will use me 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.919
 they say this has taken a picture and I do not 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.960
 I worry about your camera what I say is 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.879
 sure that photo is good so 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.979
 so what is the real brand the brand 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.139
 real is the name of that person so 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.029
 Let's obsess, do not be me 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.800
 frikis of all this 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.979
 geeks in the good term of the word 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.080
 because you end up in the forums fighting 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.569
 if this one has more and over the other and you're 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.210
 of a million and a half or that this one has 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.029
 800 megapixels that after you do not fit 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.460
 on the hard drive or that the other camera the 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:56.219
 chromatic aberration oh my god the 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.870
 chromatic aberration seriously I have 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.550
 fear I'm afraid to go to a convention 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.560
 of photographers to see if they are going to throw 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.110
 the objectives 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.090
 to the cameras not to the heads that 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.729
 those goals weigh many guys 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.789
 guys, guys 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.559
 take that camera go out to take pictures that 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.509
 I do not care about the camera that carries the 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.069
 side is not going to be better than you and 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.319
 you do not want you can already be 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.909
 doing the photos with a mobile that with 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.159
 the best camera in the world that if you 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.809
 put to it at the end you will finish 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.939
 getting what you want and here I 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.529
 dismissal I do not intend to continue with all this 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.419
 because I'm going to follow you 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:31.789
 fighting in forums and comments 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:35.050
 that I piro with my camera do some 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.050
 how many photos we see
