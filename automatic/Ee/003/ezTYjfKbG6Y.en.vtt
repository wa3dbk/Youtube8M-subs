too far into it as much as I hope that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
too far into it as much as I hope that
it's<00:00:37.050> legitimate<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.800> fear<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.699> it's<00:00:39.000> not<00:00:39.149> i

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it's legitimate I fear that it's not i

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.560 
it's legitimate I fear that it's not i
don't<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.079> mean<00:00:41.000> there<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> literally

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
don't think it I mean there is literally

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.889 
don't think it I mean there is literally
no<00:00:42.989> other<00:00:43.320> proof<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.480> time<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> making

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
no other proof and at the time of making

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.780 
no other proof and at the time of making
the<00:00:46.140> video<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> post<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.980> still<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.700> me

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
the video the post was still up for me

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.200 
the video the post was still up for me
because<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.540> made<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> before<00:00:49.079> uh<00:00:49.770> before<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:51.059> was

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
because I made it before uh before I was

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
because I made it before uh before I was
taken<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> made<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> video<00:00:52.680> earlier

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
taken down so I made the video earlier

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
taken down so I made the video earlier
and<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:54.540> post<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:55.020> taken<00:00:55.290> down<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> that's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

and the post was taken down and that's
the<00:00:56.160> only<00:00:56.570> legitimate<00:00:58.219> reason<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.460> could

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
the only legitimate reason that could

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.440 
the only legitimate reason that could
