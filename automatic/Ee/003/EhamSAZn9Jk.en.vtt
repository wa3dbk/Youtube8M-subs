00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
reason the invisible wall like along the
cliff<00:01:43.380> side<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.340> bigger<00:01:44.970> than

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
cliff side is a little bit bigger than

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
cliff side is a little bit bigger than
you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.220> always

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can see so it's like they always

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
you can see so it's like they always
shoot<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> wall<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.509> never<00:01:48.689> hits<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
shoot at the wall and it never hits you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.240 
shoot at the wall and it never hits you
for<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.439> reason<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.829> don't<00:01:49.979> know

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
for some reason I don't know

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
for some reason I don't know
I<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.270> only<00:01:51.420> thing<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> look<00:01:52.020> out

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I and the only thing you got to look out

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
I and the only thing you got to look out
for<00:01:52.230> as<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.010> just<00:01:53.040> saw<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.550> those<00:01:53.640> drop<00:01:54.000> ships

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
for as you just saw are those drop ships

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
for as you just saw are those drop ships
those<00:01:54.630> drop<00:01:54.900> ships<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.350> come<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
those drop ships will come in here and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.070 
those drop ships will come in here and
try<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.670> blow<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.480> they<00:01:57.630> come<00:01:57.870> in<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
try to blow you up when they come in and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.530 
try to blow you up when they come in and
out<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.580> very<00:01:59.610> careful<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.390> watch

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
out so just be very careful and watch

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
out so just be very careful and watch
out<00:02:00.720> for<00:02:00.750> those<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.350> always<00:02:01.740> hear<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.160> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
out for those I always hear them and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.860 
out for those I always hear them and
whenever<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.670> hear<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.270> hover<00:02:03.660> in<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
whenever I hear them I just hover in the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.990 
whenever I hear them I just hover in the
air<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.470> can't<00:02:04.710> shoot<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.850> you're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
air so they can't shoot you but you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490
