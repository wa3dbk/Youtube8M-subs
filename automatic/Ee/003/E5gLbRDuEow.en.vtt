 movements I'm here we go 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.840
 I think yes control over 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.460
 Y 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.460

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.839
 the lost vision 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.030
 and we go to the extraction point 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.759
 We are the best of the best, the best of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.050
 the best 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:26.409
 we are going 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.430
 had quick is the left mention 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.140
 do not go to give 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.950
 and we're going to see the kinematics 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.950
 we come to the end 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.560
 or if 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's better here ran that here I stay 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 of garbage 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
 it can be 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.150
 come back to boil 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.050
 and demons 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.050
 Hahaha 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.979
 is ready what can I say 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.590
 little yes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.690
 and ready 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.720
 can the whole city and that's how it is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.300
 ends the campaign of halo 3 odst with 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.080
 style and nothing else we have to see here the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.140
 epilogue and then with the fucking Johnson of 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.090
 johnson who did not want to give spoilers anymore 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.770
 it went out there so you leave anxious 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.959
 complete all game levels in 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.420
 Normal difficulty should give us fears 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.420
 the heroic in theory theoretically 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.459
 and today it is if it looks much better not 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.940
 the lighting more than anything to the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.940
 clarity 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.480
 it is important you know things 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.810
 hell the simple adrenaline not 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.340
 I compose would be the bug 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.920
 hahaha that a very co-pilot sent you 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.810
 special does not bite and unlike you 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.560
 know that visible those cruises so that 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.510
 leave us alone 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.510
 I think they are already very busy 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.260
 control is vibrating moves I was looking for 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.499
 How about you 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.499
 of us 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.180
 win the war ask me then not 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.190
 asks nothing to win the war against a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.110
 alien race good a conglomeration 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.510
 of alien races that are us 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.510
 exterminating then 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.460
 to the beast 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.920
 what a good campaign its pretty good is 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.490
 cortito is the truth but it's worth a lot 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.250
 sorry yes the truth yes 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.820
 Look, the ark is already being excavated there 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.820
 you leave 23 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.690
 the winds 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.720
 still missing more 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.540
 can see black screen but beresford 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.470
 high now will not go out or scream the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.080
 time 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:38.270
 Carney anticipated new laughter in his kind of 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:40.330
 dance because the cinematic is what 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.099
 authorized 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.669
 but it was my mission and it's my 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:49.599
 interrogation we only capture one is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.110
 very delicate do not worry about them 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.110
 like 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:03.430
 the gel map recites candle 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.409
 orbit with half or we do not have clear 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.590
 how a remote connection to the 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.400
 Water 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.910
 quiet cats sergeant please is 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.430
 extremely flammable the brutes 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.170
 those bastards that put bombs on your 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.170
 friends and killed millions of mine 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.379
 they are digging a good hole 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:30.059
 are you going to tell me exactly what it is that 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:33.059
 search and then you will help me stop them 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.059
 Campeche 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.390
 like by the way then the camera 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:49.400
 There is everything pro 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:51.740
 very well we come to angela bassett and 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.510
 the Alava flexion and it was quite 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.600
 but what do you think about it? 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.870
 I liked it, it was good to revisit 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.700
 new mombasa as the rookie as the 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.280
 fucked novice and the truth to look 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.650
 for those who do not have it right now who do not 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.740
 they got them because they were sent 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.120
 per message a code costs 65 pesos and 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.310
 the truth is that it 's pretty good if 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.750
 Presti they like and what I do them 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.030
 I recommend that you buy it we upload all 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.630
 the campaign from mission one to 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.500
 the latter the prologue to the epilogue 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.810
 exactly from but then until the 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.370
 epilogue and well we were jumping a 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.380
 mission and a mission in each of the 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.360
 channels so it's important that they go 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.460
 and check all the channels that are 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.750
 they lost some mission or something and if at 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.090
