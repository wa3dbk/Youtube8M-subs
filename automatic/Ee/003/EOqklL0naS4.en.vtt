having<00:01:23.470> an<00:01:23.590> eye<00:01:23.710> primer<00:01:24.100> because<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.420> don't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
having an eye primer because I don't

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.640

know maybe there's like a certain
formulation<00:01:27.430> with<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.210> really<00:01:28.750> makes<00:01:28.900> it

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
formulation with it that really makes it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.840
