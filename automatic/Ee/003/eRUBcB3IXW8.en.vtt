00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.310
 Hmm 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.250
 me 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.700
 Yes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.360
 Everybody here the number steel tower also shape llama 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.260
 Mountain eating art 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.260
 It is the second part 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.630
 Though this is a room where you can make ok 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.740
 It is a sound motive to say Weber room 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.750
 I work in the middle of the mystery 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.260
 Yes 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.710
 Does the above 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.710
 here you go 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.690
 Yes should Let's see if dry 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.790
 It seems to be dry enough 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.790
 In We will paint the color of the underlying 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:10.850
 I we use what's called Tamiya of water-based paint 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:18.659
 I think this will be a favorite 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 It is Toka undercoat has been released, for example, from the railway model maker 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.810
 You may use other paints or something 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 I am relatively easy to handle 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 We use travel ad water-based paint 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 Color too 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 When but I think that due to the taste that I personality got bored make on the way in what a slob 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.730
 is not it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.380
 If you paint it green, you will not see it as a mountain. 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.380
 This color was selected 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.460
 When we want to express a little more Mapo Ward 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.550
 We express using such Kobayashi cluster and such a thing 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.210
 Because a little sponge lump is large 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.369
 I will break up finely 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.000
 The size is fine 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.000
 I think that it is fine if you can break it to your favorite size 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.659
 I use Reiko Bond when pasting 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.659
 I bought the greater the use another workshop of a large amount 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.780
 Directly on the mountain 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.069
 Cheer up 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 a little 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.000
 In something secondary Association 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.000
 And will extend 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.860
 I've finished painting the bond 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.270
 The sponge I broke off earlier 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.670
 I will paste it 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.440
 It is fine if you do it properly 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.660
 The sound adhesive such as bond and pressed against the little stronger 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.040
 I think that it becomes difficult to take the person who was firm 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 If you overturn this , you will be able to express trees 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.490
 I would like to explain how to use the product called coaster woman 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:27.620
 Because it is thinner than the sponge of this time 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.620
 I will put it directly into the aqueous solution of woodworking bond 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.210
 Though it is an aqueous solution of this woodworking bond 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:45.630
 Drop 12 drops of dishwashing liquid and so on 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:45.630
 I think that the above-mentioned sponge becomes more familiar by the function of surfactant 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:57.390
 Let's mix different colors to make a little change 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:03.020
 It was stirred with tweezers Once in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.020
 I will try to be consistent with the whole 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.180
 Hmm 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.209
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.209
 Oh 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.400
 It's mixed up 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.400
 I will use tweezers on the ground etc. 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:30.620
 I'm putting it directly now, but it is better to put it on the rise bond thin board as mentioned earlier 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.910
 As adhesion becomes strong 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.910
 I think that is better 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.880
 More than 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.470
 It was how to make of a hindrance 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.470
 Was it helpful?
