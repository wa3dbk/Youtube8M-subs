 not basic how to coordinate movements 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.809

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.640
 by twisting someone quickly getting 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.740
 long it turns out right away we start 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.110
 swing but brings back starts 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.870
 shed this hit matching when we

 I wonder why the length is tucked 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 2 3 and so on and then through imitation 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:54.030
 let's make a simple miracle steadily 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.649
