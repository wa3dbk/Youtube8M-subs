00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
I think what sets us apart from the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700 
I think what sets us apart from the
competition<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:09.329> that<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.350> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
competition is that we actually have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.099 
competition is that we actually have
this<00:01:10.859> teamwork<00:01:11.210> teamwork<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.509> very<00:01:12.570> important

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
this teamwork teamwork is very important

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.840 
this teamwork teamwork is very important
I'm<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> futurist<00:01:14.039> I<00:01:14.219> look<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.490> things<00:01:14.610> five

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I'm a futurist I look at things five

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
I'm a futurist I look at things five
steps<00:01:15.090> ahead<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> need<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> team<00:01:16.560> where
