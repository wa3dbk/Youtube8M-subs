yes<00:00:01.319> question<00:00:01.500> 20<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.490> higher<00:00:02.700> calculator

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
yes question 20 on the higher calculator

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.380 
yes question 20 on the higher calculator
paper<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.830> an<00:00:05.339> algebra<00:00:05.790> question<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
paper this is a an algebra question and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.169 
paper this is a an algebra question and
it's<00:00:07.170> actually<00:00:07.500> algebraic<00:00:07.890> fractions<00:00:08.550> and

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
it's actually algebraic fractions and

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.350 
it's actually algebraic fractions and
they<00:00:09.300> want<00:00:09.480> me<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.630> add<00:00:10.460> these<00:00:11.460> two<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.090> X

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
they want me to add these two so it's X

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.859 
they want me to add these two so it's X
plus<00:00:12.540> 1<00:00:13.380> all<00:00:14.009> over<00:00:14.070> 2<00:00:14.519> plus<00:00:15.450> X<00:00:16.230> plus<00:00:17.039> 3<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:17.970> over

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
plus 1 all over 2 plus X plus 3 all over

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.730 
plus 1 all over 2 plus X plus 3 all over
3<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.070> question<00:00:20.340> simply<00:00:20.640> says<00:00:20.820> simplify

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
3 and the question simply says simplify

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.460 
3 and the question simply says simplify
okay<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:25.140> am

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
okay so what I'm going to do is I am

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.750 
okay so what I'm going to do is I am
going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> try<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> bring<00:00:26.310> these<00:00:26.460> two

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
going to try to bring these two

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.349 
going to try to bring these two
fractions<00:00:27.150> over<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.289> single<00:00:28.920> denominator<00:00:29.580> what

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
fractions over a single denominator what

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.549 
fractions over a single denominator what
number<00:00:30.630> could<00:00:30.750> 2<00:00:31.050> &amp;<00:00:31.380> 3<00:00:31.470> go<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:34.079> going

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
number could 2 &amp; 3 go into so I'm going

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
number could 2 &amp; 3 go into so I'm going
to<00:00:34.710> change<00:00:35.280> both<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.730> those<00:00:35.850> fractions<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to change both of those fractions so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.319 
to change both of those fractions so
that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> denominators<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.280> exactly<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that the denominators are exactly the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.190 
that the denominators are exactly the
same<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.840> both<00:00:39.950> 2<00:00:40.950> &amp;<00:00:41.100> 3<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.790> could<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.059> into<00:00:42.200> 6

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
same and both 2 &amp; 3 they could go into 6

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
same and both 2 &amp; 3 they could go into 6
so<00:00:44.100> 2<00:00:44.700> times<00:00:44.969> 3<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.450> give<00:00:45.510> me<00:00:45.750> 6<00:00:46.020> only<00:00:46.200> 2

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so 2 times 3 would give me 6 only 2

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.810 
so 2 times 3 would give me 6 only 2
times<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.399> numerator<00:00:47.750> by<00:00:48.750> 3<00:00:49.340> okay<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
times the numerator by 3 okay so in this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.410 
times the numerator by 3 okay so in this
case<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.629> 3<00:00:52.289> times<00:00:53.010> X<00:00:53.430> plus<00:00:53.850> 1

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
case I'm going to get 3 times X plus 1

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.610 
case I'm going to get 3 times X plus 1
and<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.180> I'm<00:00:57.180> x<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> both<00:00:58.289> top<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and that's because I'm x in both top and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.609 
and that's because I'm x in both top and
bottom<00:00:59.420> by<00:01:00.420> 3<00:01:01.699> okay<00:01:02.699> I'm<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> times<00:01:04.049> top

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bottom by 3 okay I'm going to times top

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.539 
bottom by 3 okay I'm going to times top
and<00:01:04.650> bottom<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:07.170> 2<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.490> 3

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and bottom of this one here by 2 is 3

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
and bottom of this one here by 2 is 3
times<00:01:08.850> 2<00:01:09.360> gives<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.659> 6<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> times

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
times 2 gives me 6 so I'm going to times

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.990 
times 2 gives me 6 so I'm going to times
the<00:01:11.159> numerator<00:01:11.369> X<00:01:11.970> plus<00:01:12.240> 3<00:01:12.659> by<00:01:13.500> 2<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.820> going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the numerator X plus 3 by 2 so I'm going

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.190 
the numerator X plus 3 by 2 so I'm going
to<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.150> 2<00:01:15.420> times<00:01:15.840> X<00:01:16.290> plus<00:01:16.680> 3<00:01:17.869> now<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> need<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
to get 2 times X plus 3 now I need to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.370 
to get 2 times X plus 3 now I need to
work<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.799> okay<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.049> adding

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
work this out okay if when I'm adding

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
work this out okay if when I'm adding
fractions<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> denominators<00:01:23.729> are

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
fractions if the denominators are

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.690 
fractions if the denominators are
exactly<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.990> could<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:25.830> all

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
exactly the same I could put them all

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.380 
exactly the same I could put them all
over<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:28.110> denominator<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.240> all

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
over the same denominator so it's all

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
over the same denominator so it's all
going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.750> over<00:01:30.990> 6<00:01:32.150> multiplying<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
going to be over 6 multiplying out the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.859 
going to be over 6 multiplying out the
top<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.250> I'll<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.729> 3<00:01:36.299> X<00:01:36.770> plus<00:01:37.770> 3

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
top of that one I'll get 3 X plus 3

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.660 
top of that one I'll get 3 X plus 3
added<00:01:39.869> 2<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.380> multiplying<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> top<00:01:41.549> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
added 2 I'm multiplying out the top of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
added 2 I'm multiplying out the top of
this<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.000> I'll<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.780> 3<00:01:43.079> 2<00:01:43.500> times<00:01:43.770> X<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.520> 2x<00:01:45.590> 2

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
this one I'll get 3 2 times X is 2x 2

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.240 
this one I'll get 3 2 times X is 2x 2
times<00:01:46.860> 3<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.479> 6

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
times 3 is 6

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.280 
times 3 is 6
okay<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> need<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> tidy<00:01:52.110> up

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
okay all I need to do now is to tidy up

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.069 
okay all I need to do now is to tidy up
the<00:01:52.530> top<00:01:53.390> 3x<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.659> 2x<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.409> 5x<00:01:56.130> +<00:01:57.380> 3<00:01:58.380> plus<00:01:59.009> 6<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.610> 9

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the top 3x at 2x is 5x + 3 plus 6 is 9

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.929 
the top 3x at 2x is 5x + 3 plus 6 is 9
that<00:02:01.649> gives<00:02:01.860> me<00:02:01.979> 5x<00:02:02.869> +<00:02:03.869> 9<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.439> over<00:02:04.759> 6

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
that gives me 5x + 9 all over 6

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
that gives me 5x + 9 all over 6
and<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:06.659> final<00:02:06.810> answer<00:02:07.020> that's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and that's my final answer that's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
and that's my final answer that's
simplifying<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:08.970> answer<00:02:09.360> space<00:02:09.599> I'm

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
simplifying it my in my answer space I'm

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
simplifying it my in my answer space I'm
going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.989> write<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.319> 5<00:02:11.069> X<00:02:11.310> +<00:02:11.610> 9<00:02:12.290> /

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
going to write that down 5 X + 9 /

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.250 
going to write that down 5 X + 9 /
six<00:02:14.450> especially<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.600> those<00:02:15.660> people<00:02:15.720> who<00:02:16.110> are

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
aiming for top grades you need to be

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
aiming for top grades you need to be
familiar<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.220> should<00:02:20.430> be
