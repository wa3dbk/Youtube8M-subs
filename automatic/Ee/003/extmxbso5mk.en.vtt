what<00:02:05.900> about<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.290> right<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.740> looks<00:02:06.800> like

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
what about this right this looks like

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.150 
what about this right this looks like
grass<00:02:07.430> doesn't<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:09.229> what<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.650> step<00:02:09.979> on

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
grass doesn't it but what if I step on

it oh no I fell in two spikes and what

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.570 
it oh no I fell in two spikes and what
this<00:02:14.060> does<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.510> utilizes<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.650> fake<00:02:16.040> grass

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
this does is it utilizes the fake grass

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.030 
this does is it utilizes the fake grass
coverings<00:02:17.240> which<00:02:17.510> are<00:02:17.690> right<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:17.900> which<00:02:18.860> can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
coverings which are right here which can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.270 
coverings which are right here which can
be<00:02:19.130> crafted<00:02:19.400> by<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:21.010> what<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:22.190> is

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
be crafted by you this what you do is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.580 
be crafted by you this what you do is
you<00:02:22.370> just<00:02:22.400> place<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:22.850> right<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.150> top<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.750> what

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you just place it right on top and what

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.560 
you just place it right on top and what
happens<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.130> when<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> step<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.180> breaks

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
happens is when you step on it it breaks

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.780 
happens is when you step on it it breaks
and<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.170> two<00:02:27.470> sticks<00:02:27.860> for<00:02:28.190> every<00:02:28.430> single

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and you get two sticks for every single

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.750 
and you get two sticks for every single
one<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:28.970> these<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.350> get<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.160> little<00:02:31.490> bit

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
one of these so you do get a little bit

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.880 
one of these so you do get a little bit
less<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.420> return<00:02:32.780> from<00:02:33.080> what<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.560> use<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
less in return from what you use to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.470 
less in return from what you use to
craft<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.490> but<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.850> know<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.210> least<00:02:35.270> you're

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
craft it but you know at least you're

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.720 
craft it but you know at least you're
getting<00:02:35.540> something<00:02:35.840> back<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.370> really

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
getting something back and the really

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.260 
getting something back and the really
really<00:02:37.940> cool<00:02:38.180> part<00:02:38.390> about<00:02:38.570> these<00:02:40.270> spikes

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
really cool part about these spikes

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
really cool part about these spikes
right<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.990> well<00:02:42.380> first<00:02:42.620> of<00:02:42.770> all<00:02:42.860> you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
right here is well first of all you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.220 
right here is well first of all you
can't<00:02:43.580> jump<00:02:43.790> out<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:44.720> think<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.080> could

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
can't jump out you would think you could

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.780 
can't jump out you would think you could
jump<00:02:45.440> out<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.040> only<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.460> block

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
jump out because it's only one block

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.790 
jump out because it's only one block
deep<00:02:47.060> but<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.720> essence<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.440> actually

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
deep but in essence this is actually

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.730 
deep but in essence this is actually
more<00:02:49.400> than<00:02:49.460> one<00:02:49.730> block<00:02:49.970> deep<00:02:50.210> so<00:02:50.540> our<00:02:50.930> player

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
more than one block deep so our player

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.100 
more than one block deep so our player
can<00:02:51.920> only<00:02:52.070> jump<00:02:52.370> one<00:02:52.820> block<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.480> he<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.750> stuck

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
can only jump one block so he is stuck

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.760 
can only jump one block so he is stuck
and<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.940> nice<00:02:56.270> part<00:02:56.630> about<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:57.050> what<00:02:57.440> happens

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
and the nice part about is what happens

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.370 
and the nice part about is what happens
if<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.190> mob<00:02:58.430> drops<00:02:58.790> its<00:02:59.000> things<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.420> here<00:02:59.690> let's

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
if a mob drops its things on here let's

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.070 
if a mob drops its things on here let's
see<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.860> doesn't<00:03:01.520> destroy<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> item<00:03:02.240> unlike<00:03:03.050> a

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
see it doesn't destroy the item unlike a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.870 
see it doesn't destroy the item unlike a
cactus<00:03:03.590> where<00:03:03.800> if<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.040> throw<00:03:04.280> an<00:03:04.400> item<00:03:04.700> onto

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
cactus where if you throw an item onto

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.720 
cactus where if you throw an item onto
the<00:03:05.060> cacti<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:05.900> disappear<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.730> just

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the cacti it will disappear and just

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.880 
the cacti it will disappear and just
quickly<00:03:07.880> demonstrate<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:09.020> real<00:03:09.290> quick<00:03:09.620> we

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
quickly demonstrate that real quick we

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.699 
quickly demonstrate that real quick we
have<00:03:10.040> enough<00:03:10.340> grass<00:03:10.850> coverings<00:03:11.480> anyway<00:03:11.870> it's

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
have enough grass coverings anyway it's

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.910 
have enough grass coverings anyway it's
not<00:03:12.860> too<00:03:13.100> bad<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.140> happens<00:03:15.410> if<00:03:15.560> an<00:03:15.770> item

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
not too bad so what happens if an item

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.070 
not too bad so what happens if an item
touches<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> cactus<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.150> disappears<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.020> you

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
touches a cactus it disappears so you

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.620 
touches a cactus it disappears so you
you<00:03:18.680> know<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.830> can<00:03:19.070> use<00:03:19.190> as<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.459> trash<00:03:19.700> can<00:03:19.910> but

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
you know you can use as a trash can but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.990 
you know you can use as a trash can but
if<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.110> use<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.380> as<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> trap<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.250> has<00:03:22.760> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
if you use it as a trap it has the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.300 
if you use it as a trap it has the
possibility<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.720> destroying<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.980> dropped

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
possibility of destroying the dropped

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610 
possibility of destroying the dropped
item<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:26.540> doesn't<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.440> nice<00:03:27.590> thing

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
item this doesn't that's the nice thing

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.870 
item this doesn't that's the nice thing
about<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:29.000> spikes<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:30.580> if<00:03:31.580> we<00:03:31.700> take<00:03:31.820> a

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
about the the spikes and if we take a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.090 
about the the spikes and if we take a
look<00:03:32.060> at<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.630> igniters<00:03:33.200> which<00:03:33.620> are<00:03:33.830> over

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
look at the the igniters which are over

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.280 
look at the the igniters which are over
here<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.459> lined<00:03:34.820> them<00:03:34.970> up<00:03:35.120> as<00:03:35.360> long<00:03:35.989> as<00:03:36.019> you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
here I have lined them up as long as you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.650 
here I have lined them up as long as you
supply<00:03:36.739> some<00:03:37.070> sort<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.400> power<00:03:37.670> current<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.480> it

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
supply some sort of power current to it

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.420 
supply some sort of power current to it
whether<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.500> button<00:03:39.739> lever<00:03:40.010> pressure

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430

under<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.300> or<00:03:44.450> something<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.489> ignite<00:03:46.910> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
under it or something you can ignite the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.150 
under it or something you can ignite the
block<00:03:47.300> which<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.140> be<00:03:48.230> used<00:03:48.440> as<00:03:48.620> like<00:03:49.130> a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
block which can be used as like a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.920 
block which can be used as like a
fireplace<00:03:49.820> or<00:03:50.030> maybe<00:03:50.269> or<00:03:50.510> something<00:03:50.840> like

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
fireplace or maybe or something like

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.740 
fireplace or maybe or something like
that<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.760> eventually<00:03:52.760> these<00:03:52.880> will<00:03:53.269> be

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
that and eventually these will be

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.210 
that and eventually these will be
these<00:03:55.870> will<00:03:56.140> stop<00:03:56.920> being<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.090> fire<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.040> is

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
these will stop being on fire so this is

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.160 
these will stop being on fire so this is
for<00:04:00.520> you<00:04:00.670> may<00:04:00.880> be<00:04:00.940> used<00:04:01.180> for<00:04:01.360> may<00:04:01.510> be<00:04:01.570> temporary

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
for you may be used for may be temporary

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.990 
for you may be used for may be temporary
light<00:04:02.500> or<00:04:02.620> something<00:04:02.770> or<00:04:03.280> maybe<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.790> want<00:04:03.970> a

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
light or something or maybe you want a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.030 
light or something or maybe you want a
permanent<00:04:04.320> fireplace<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.710> can<00:04:05.830> turn<00:04:05.980> on

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
permanent fireplace that you can turn on

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.270 
permanent fireplace that you can turn on
and<00:04:06.340> off<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:07.530> that's<00:04:08.530> pretty<00:04:08.800> cool<00:04:09.040> and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
and off and that's pretty cool and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
and off and that's pretty cool and
eventually<00:04:09.730> these<00:04:09.850> will<00:04:10.090> die<00:04:10.270> down<00:04:10.300> as<00:04:10.690> well

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
eventually these will die down as well

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.620 
eventually these will die down as well
so<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.440> bear<00:04:14.620> traps<00:04:14.950> we<00:04:15.070> took<00:04:15.220> tip<00:04:15.670> did<00:04:16.090> we've

whether it's a pressure plate or
anything<00:04:34.240> like<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.419> maybe<00:04:35.020> just<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.290> redstone

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530

torch I get blown away and I'm not
touching<00:04:38.770> my<00:04:38.890> keyboard<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.580> watch<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> fight

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
touching my keyboard and watch the fight

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
I can't fight the wind but I'm a lot

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.460 
I can't fight the wind but I'm a lot
slower<00:04:42.940> than<00:04:43.630> I'm<00:04:43.840> when<00:04:44.050> I'm<00:04:44.140> just<00:04:44.320> walking

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.080 
slower than I'm when I'm just walking
normally<00:04:44.830> which<00:04:45.310> is<00:04:45.430> really<00:04:45.730> really

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
normally which is really really

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.090 
normally which is really really
interesting<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.320> cool<00:04:47.590> part<00:04:47.890> about<00:04:47.919> it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
interesting and the cool part about it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.580 
interesting and the cool part about it
is<00:04:48.310> if<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:48.880> drop<00:04:49.180> an<00:04:49.330> item<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.810> its<00:04:49.990> range<00:04:50.320> it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
is if I drop an item in its range it

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.100 
is if I drop an item in its range it
will<00:04:50.830> blow<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.250> away<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.760> this<00:04:52.390> is<00:04:52.660> also<00:04:52.840> good

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
will blow it away and this is also good

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.200 
will blow it away and this is also good
for<00:04:53.320> blowing<00:04:53.680> mobs<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:55.180> let's<00:04:55.360> see<00:04:55.630> if<00:04:55.950> we<00:04:57.210> put

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
for blowing mobs so let's see if we put

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.440 
for blowing mobs so let's see if we put
a<00:04:58.390> few<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:59.220> these<00:05:00.220> redstone<00:05:00.700> torches<00:05:01.030> and

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
on a two block high wooden block for us

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.870 
on a two block high wooden block for us
to<00:05:32.080> get<00:05:32.229> our<00:05:32.350> dummy<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.890> it<00:05:33.370> doesn't<00:05:33.550> work<00:05:33.760> on

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
to get our dummy and it doesn't work on

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.320 
to get our dummy and it doesn't work on
anything<00:05:34.180> else<00:05:34.510> so<00:05:34.780> let's<00:05:34.990> say<00:05:35.200> I<00:05:35.229> have<00:05:35.470> dirt

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
anything else so let's say I have dirt

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.600 
anything else so let's say I have dirt
for<00:05:37.330> some<00:05:37.479> weird<00:05:37.720> reason<00:05:38.010> places<00:05:39.010> down<00:05:39.190> try<00:05:39.550> to

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
for some weird reason places down try to

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.180 
for some weird reason places down try to
put<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:39.850> dummy<00:05:40.060> head<00:05:40.600> on<00:05:40.720> top<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.710> does<00:05:41.979> not

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
put the dummy head on top it does not

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.240 
put the dummy head on top it does not
work<00:05:42.460> so<00:05:42.940> that's<00:05:43.300> pretty<00:05:43.570> interesting

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
work so that's pretty interesting

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.290

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
if I break if I just drop a redstone

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.960 
if I break if I just drop a redstone
torch<00:06:02.600> in<00:06:02.900> here<00:06:02.930> it's<00:06:03.710> got<00:06:03.889> a<00:06:04.040> magnetic<00:06:04.550> pole

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
torch in here it's got a magnetic pole

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.420 
torch in here it's got a magnetic pole
to<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.570> any<00:06:06.230> item<00:06:06.620> that<00:06:06.650> touches<00:06:07.130> it<00:06:07.250> will

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
to it and any item that touches it will

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.420 
to it and any item that touches it will
end<00:06:07.639> up<00:06:07.880> in<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.300> chest<00:06:08.690> which<00:06:09.020> is<00:06:09.050> awesome<00:06:09.620> and

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
end up in the chest which is awesome and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.940 
end up in the chest which is awesome and
the<00:06:11.090> cool<00:06:11.330> part<00:06:11.540> about<00:06:11.630> it<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:11.930> maybe<00:06:12.530> it's<00:06:12.740> so

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
the cool part about it is maybe it's so

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.120 
the cool part about it is maybe it's so
it's<00:06:13.190> too<00:06:13.400> far<00:06:13.639> away<00:06:13.960> but<00:06:14.960> if<00:06:15.260> you<00:06:15.470> have<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:15.680> fan

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
it's too far away but if you have a fan

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.620 
it's too far away but if you have a fan
pointing<00:06:16.700> at<00:06:16.820> it<00:06:17.000> and<00:06:17.120> then<00:06:17.540> you<00:06:17.750> drop<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:19.630> look

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
pointing at it and then you drop it look

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.220 
pointing at it and then you drop it look
at<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.930> isn't<00:06:21.350> that<00:06:21.380> awesome<00:06:21.820> you<00:06:22.820> get

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
at that isn't that awesome you get

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.650 
at that isn't that awesome you get
pretty<00:06:24.230> much<00:06:24.470> a<00:06:24.830> self<00:06:25.370> traveling<00:06:26.030> I<00:06:26.210> don't

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
pretty much a self traveling I don't

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.620 
pretty much a self traveling I don't
know<00:06:26.720> halfway<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:28.640> really<00:06:28.850> cool<00:06:29.030> thing<00:06:29.510> about

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
know halfway the really cool thing about

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.240 
know halfway the really cool thing about
these<00:06:29.900> fans<00:06:30.200> is<00:06:30.350> you<00:06:30.470> can<00:06:30.620> actually<00:06:30.650> use<00:06:30.919> it<00:06:31.130> to

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
these fans is you can actually use it to

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.870 
these fans is you can actually use it to
speed<00:06:31.580> up<00:06:31.730> maybe<00:06:32.000> your<00:06:32.570> I<00:06:33.010> don't<00:06:34.010> know<00:06:34.100> your

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
speed up maybe your I don't know your

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.090 
speed up maybe your I don't know your
movement<00:06:35.300> speed<00:06:35.330> so<00:06:35.780> watch<00:06:36.050> just<00:06:36.710> walking

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
movement speed so watch just walking

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.980 
movement speed so watch just walking
normally<00:06:37.280> like<00:06:37.669> that<00:06:37.880> but<00:06:38.150> if<00:06:38.240> I<00:06:38.330> walk<00:06:38.570> in<00:06:38.720> the

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
normally like that but if I walk in the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.820 
normally like that but if I walk in the
line<00:06:39.260> of<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.650> fan<00:06:40.240> it's<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.360> lot<00:06:41.540> faster<00:06:41.800> so<00:06:42.800> you

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
line of the fan it's a lot faster so you

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.710 
line of the fan it's a lot faster so you
can<00:06:42.979> probably<00:06:43.160> have<00:06:43.370> some<00:06:43.550> sort<00:06:43.700> of<00:06:43.820> automatic

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
can probably have some sort of automatic

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.490 
can probably have some sort of automatic
you<00:06:45.440> know<00:06:46.540> traveling<00:06:47.540> system<00:06:47.960> that<00:06:48.350> you<00:06:48.470> can

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
you know traveling system that you can

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.640 
you know traveling system that you can
just<00:06:48.770> go<00:06:48.950> AFK<00:06:49.490> and<00:06:49.700> end<00:06:50.210> up<00:06:50.660> in<00:06:50.750> a<00:06:50.840> face<00:06:51.110> far<00:06:51.440> far

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
just go AFK and end up in a face far far

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.740 
just go AFK and end up in a face far far
away<00:06:51.970> but<00:06:52.970> yeah<00:06:53.120> that<00:06:53.300> pretty<00:06:53.390> much<00:06:53.510> wraps

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
away but yeah that pretty much wraps

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.930 
away but yeah that pretty much wraps
things<00:06:53.990> up<00:06:54.169> for<00:06:54.320> this<00:06:54.440> video<00:06:54.650> so<00:06:55.610> if<00:06:55.700> you<00:06:55.790> can
