00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello friends nightly this day has become 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.859
 that we have already become more than 1000 as you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.970
 see it as many as 10 cinema halls yes 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.429
 guys are not a joke 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.940
 that's why many of you are watching my 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 video before but they don't know how to do 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.880
 best quality 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 it less dependent not only on me, well, 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 as well as from you therefore I am to you today 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 3 browsers will demonstrate this google 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.840
 chrome and opera and mozilla 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 these three browsers are different from each other 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.180
 a friend so that the smoothness of the picture is like 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.050
 I am at all different here Well let 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.610
 let's look under it and for a start the browser 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 google chrome and we will watch one and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.670
 also video to understand looked 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 the difference 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 or even if she or a unit like this 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.739
 google chrome with youtube support 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.440
 has 60 fps of course the best 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.629
 the quality is the best humidity will be 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 let's see justify google 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.590
 chrome its or not as unwashed 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.350
 likes likes right away let's get 32 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.380
 seconds for a moment to pause 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.970
 Now I show you see the quality 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 1080p 60fps 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 the rest of the browser is just 1080p 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 the fact that it says that the quality will not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.820
 60 frames per second will be standard 30 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 although neither at cif 30 we will see 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:30.010
 more so Well 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:33.070
 and see a video look yes right 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.920
 angle of the names of the players no video 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 blur smoothness is very good 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.990
 just look at all the names are visible 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.870
 very clear 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.540
 Well here we are 32 seconds and watched 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.180
 the same thing we therefore see now 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.040
 google chrome open and perhaps on 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.060
 second place yes second place opera 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:01.690
 which is supporting 40 fps though there are 40 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:06.310
 not visible in principle no difference yes on 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.729
 what second as annotations turn off here 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 see how i said ring here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.690
 1080p 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.550
 but the opera has support sort of then 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.550
 the quality will be pretty good too 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.140
 make the sound quieter and look guys 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.670
 see the blurry picture already 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.690
 present 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 it is here that the quality is not that but all 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.760
 itâ€™s pretty good sometimes 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.430
 not for the browser to depend, I will tell you so 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 sometimes even depends on youtube i mean i 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
 I try to render the maximum 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.110
 maximum bitrate maximum 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.870
 rolling to provide your eye 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.260
 enjoyable and delighted with this video 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.209
 But sometimes it happens like that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.680
 youtube lays whether it is not clear what 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.970
 that here of course blur 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
 until 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.640
 I did not understand this but for you I 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.020
 try to make the best video right here 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.840
 at the very highest quality 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.770
 but also rented yes maximum quality 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:17.370
 the fact that the computer goes to you 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.520
 looked up to the blur of opera slightly 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.840
 20 fps 20 frames a second but they decide 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:29.310
 ok let's proceed further so stayed with us 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.590
 the last browser is mozilla open 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.820
 same video at 30 second sound and 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.640
 make pay but here is also a notation 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:47.000
 off and see the quality and keep 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:50.850
 even so seen for some reason see through 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.120
 Mozilla even 1080 sometimes does not give you 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.310
 just look mozilla guys not even 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.310
 wants to issue as so 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:18.049
 In general, there is much more blurring if you are 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:19.010
 notice we are now watching a video at 30 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.690
 fps and 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.380
 he is different firstly 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.720
 quality since it is 720 and of course 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.850
 at frames per second so guys 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.650
 draw conclusions and decide yourself what 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.830
 you prefer and with what browser 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.470
 you're used to but of course the video 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.650
 please your eye as I said it 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.540
 repeatedly I would certainly advise 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.820
 would you google chrome browser 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.700
 so guys here you already see 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.730
 which browser will choose mazil 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.040
 opera or google chrome but these are mine 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.830
 subscribers I would like my videos 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.290
 always pleased your class so I would 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.620
 would advise google chrome since you 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.280
 have seen that here support at 60fps 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.570
 Here, but maybe not all at 60fps will go 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.030
 that is, since 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.310
 either depends on the internet or else 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.880
 from the computer but those of course 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.390
 the internet is either weak or 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.320
 computer is weak 1080 by 60 may not 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.169
 support 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.470
 but pretty pretty good quality 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.840
 720 to 60 if you are already pathetic 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.020
 but on this I say goodbye to you thank 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.560
 to you for having more than 1000 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.470
 up because I would not be able to cope 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.330
 it is only of course with the help of you in 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.250
