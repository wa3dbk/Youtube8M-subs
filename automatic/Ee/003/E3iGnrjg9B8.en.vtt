00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

alright<00:00:00.750> there's<00:00:00.960> two<00:00:01.140> special<00:00:01.530> cases<00:00:01.560> that

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
alright there's two special cases that

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.010 
alright there's two special cases that
we<00:00:02.220> need<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.669> familiar<00:00:03.149> with<00:00:03.179> for<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
we need to be familiar with for a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.600 
we need to be familiar with for a
converging<00:00:04.589> device<00:00:07.280> we<00:00:08.280> do<00:00:08.429> know<00:00:08.580> what

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
converging device we do know what

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.740 
converging device we do know what
happens<00:00:09.090> when<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.420> object<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:10.019> at<00:00:10.200> infinity

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
happens when the object is at infinity

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.940 
happens when the object is at infinity
and<00:00:12.750> when<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:12.990> object<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> focal

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and when the object is at the focal

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.470 
and when the object is at the focal
point<00:00:16.699> so<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:17.820> start<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> object

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
point so we start with when the object

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.019 
point so we start with when the object
is<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.900> infinity<00:00:19.699> let's<00:00:20.699> say<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is at infinity let's say they have a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.019 
is at infinity let's say they have a
converging<00:00:21.570> device<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:23.039> object<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.760> at

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
converging device and the object is at

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.339 
converging device and the object is at
infinity<00:00:24.420> I'll<00:00:25.260> draw<00:00:25.529> lens<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
infinity I'll draw lens so we have this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
infinity I'll draw lens so we have this
converging<00:00:28.949> device<00:00:29.279> let's<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.820> happens

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
converging device let's see what happens

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.420 
converging device let's see what happens
to<00:00:30.240> our<00:00:30.300> minds<00:00:30.570> mirror<00:00:30.869> equation<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> we're

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
to our minds mirror equation so we're

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.270 
to our minds mirror equation so we're
not<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> plug<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.059> 4<00:00:36.210> 0<00:00:36.239> infinity<00:00:43.280> how's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
not going to plug in 4 0 infinity how's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.950 
not going to plug in 4 0 infinity how's
this<00:00:44.489> equation<00:00:44.940> simplify<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:47.660> 1010<00:00:48.660> cry

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
this equation simplify now 1010 cry

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
this equation simplify now 1010 cry
because<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:52.469> infinity<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.949> 0<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:53.730> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
because one over infinity is 0 good and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:06.940 
because one over infinity is 0 good and
then<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.660> does<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> simplify<00:00:55.289> some<00:00:55.350> more

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.559 

this<00:01:07.950> equation<00:01:08.249> has<00:01:08.490> fractions<00:01:08.999> it<00:01:09.359> would<00:01:09.479> be

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
this equation has fractions it would be

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.880 
this equation has fractions it would be
simpler<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.899> it<00:01:10.049> didn't<00:01:10.259> have<00:01:10.350> any<00:01:10.499> fractions

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
simpler if it didn't have any fractions

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.279 
simpler if it didn't have any fractions
I<00:01:12.289> over<00:01:13.289> have<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> could<00:01:15.600> say<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.810> that's

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
I over have you could say that that's

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.050 
I over have you could say that that's
right<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.039> be<00:01:17.130> valid<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.880> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
right that would be valid we can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.309 
right that would be valid we can
short-circuit<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.899> a<00:01:18.929> little<00:01:19.170> though

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
short-circuit that a little though

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.410 
short-circuit that a little though
because<00:01:19.679> remember<00:01:20.039> once<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.850> only<00:01:20.969> have<00:01:21.179> one

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
because remember once we only have one

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.389 
because remember once we only have one
fraction<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.929> each<00:01:22.049> side<00:01:22.319> the<00:01:22.799> easiest<00:01:23.159> thing

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
fraction on each side the easiest thing

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:24.800 
fraction on each side the easiest thing
to<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.579> algebraically<00:01:24.179> does<00:01:24.479> take<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to do algebraically does take the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.349 
to do algebraically does take the
reciprocal<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.349> both<00:01:25.890> sides<00:01:26.159> once<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.209> only

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
reciprocal of both sides once you only

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.849 
reciprocal of both sides once you only
have<00:01:27.539> one<00:01:27.719> fraction<00:01:27.959> on<00:01:28.200> each<00:01:28.319> size<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
have one fraction on each size the

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.349 
have one fraction on each size the
easiest<00:01:29.219> thing<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.789> reciprocal<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
easiest thing to take the reciprocal of

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.089 
easiest thing to take the reciprocal of
both<00:01:30.539> sides<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.469> happens<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.859> you<00:01:31.950> take

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
both sides what happens when you take

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.440 
both sides what happens when you take
the<00:01:32.219> reciprocal<00:01:32.399> of<00:01:32.700> both<00:01:32.880> sides<00:01:33.060> what

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the reciprocal of both sides what

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.080 
the reciprocal of both sides what
equation<00:01:33.719> do<00:01:33.959> you<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:41.000> what's<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
equation do you get here what's the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.479 
equation do you get here what's the
reciprocal<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.629> the<00:01:42.719> left-hand<00:01:43.079> side<00:01:46.489> or

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
reciprocal of the left-hand side or

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.359 
reciprocal of the left-hand side or
actually<00:01:48.060> yeah<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.619> what's<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> reciprocal

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
actually yeah now what's the reciprocal

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
actually yeah now what's the reciprocal
of<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.489> right-hand<00:01:50.819> side<00:01:51.200> ok<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.770> say

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of the right-hand side ok so I would say

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.260 
of the right-hand side ok so I would say
this<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.069> simpler<00:01:53.489> than<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.729> equation<00:01:54.179> over

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this is simpler than this equation over

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.669 
this is simpler than this equation over
here<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.079> would<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.349> a<00:01:55.379> good<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
here so this would be a good way to

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.349 
here so this would be a good way to
simplify<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.280> equation<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:57.119> should<00:01:57.239> already

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
simplify that equation we should already

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.639 
simplify that equation we should already
have<00:01:57.509> done<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.929> focal<00:01:58.229> length<00:01:58.379> equal

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
have done with the focal length equal

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.809 
have done with the focal length equal
the<00:01:58.770> image<00:01:58.950> distance<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.459> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.609> from

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
the image distance you can see from

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:00.949 
the image distance you can see from
looking<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.179> this<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:00.599> have<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> have

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
looking at this that these have to have

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.099 
looking at this that these have to have
the<00:02:01.049> same<00:02:01.229> denominator<00:02:01.739> this<00:02:02.099> confirms<00:02:02.459> that

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
the same denominator this confirms that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.969 
the same denominator this confirms that
the<00:02:04.109> focal<00:02:04.409> length<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.099> equals<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:06.979> image

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the focal length here I equals the image

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
the focal length here I equals the image
distance<00:02:08.359> by<00:02:09.359> the<00:02:09.420> way<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> converging

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
distance by the way this is a converging

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.629 
distance by the way this is a converging
mirror<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.700> positive<00:02:12.299> or<00:02:12.420> negative

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:13.639 
mirror so is that positive or negative

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.890 
mirror so is that positive or negative
that's<00:02:14.639> right<00:02:14.790> we'll<00:02:15.060> talk<00:02:15.239> about<00:02:15.359> converging

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
that's right we'll talk about converging

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's right we'll talk about converging
lens<00:02:16.079> or<00:02:16.260> mirror<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.739> it's<00:02:16.859> converging

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
lens or mirror so if it's converging

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.870 
lens or mirror so if it's converging
would<00:02:17.519> F<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.700> positive<00:02:18.389> or<00:02:18.480> negative<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.730> I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
would F be positive or negative so is I

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.280 
would F be positive or negative so is I
going<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.239> positive<00:02:24.450> or<00:02:24.720> negative<00:02:24.930> based

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
going to be positive or negative based

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.150 
going to be positive or negative based
on<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> equation<00:02:25.680> how's<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:28.010> what<00:02:29.010> does<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
on the equation how's it what does it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.809 
on the equation how's it what does it
mean<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.489> may<00:02:29.609> have<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> positive<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:31.549> means<00:02:32.549> we

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
mean we may have a positive I means we

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.390 
mean we may have a positive I means we
have

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
have

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.809 
have
okay<00:02:34.400> good<00:02:34.909> now<00:02:35.420> let's<00:02:36.400> draw<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.700> is

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
okay good now let's draw what this is

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.809 
okay good now let's draw what this is
going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> look<00:02:38.239> like<00:02:38.269> in<00:02:38.720> our<00:02:39.580> picture<00:02:40.580> over

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
going to look like in our picture over

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.210 
going to look like in our picture over
here<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.599> object<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.230> at<00:02:45.409> infinity<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
here when the object is at infinity the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.440 
here when the object is at infinity the
first<00:02:46.459> thing<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.730> see<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.209> when<00:02:47.360> an

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
first thing to see is that when an

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.839 
first thing to see is that when an
object<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:48.049> infinity<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.670> Rays

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
object is at infinity all of the Rays

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.570 
object is at infinity all of the Rays
come<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.660> parallel<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> axis<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.489> an

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
come in parallel to the axis and an

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.580 
come in parallel to the axis and an
object<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.060> at<00:02:53.180> infinity<00:02:53.330> all<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.049> Rays<00:02:54.230> come

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
object is at infinity all the Rays come

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:09.759 
object is at infinity all the Rays come
in<00:02:54.739> parallel<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.670> axis<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.319> see<00:03:09.590> that

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
in parallel to the axis you can see that

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.039 
in parallel to the axis you can see that
here<00:03:10.040> here's<00:03:11.000> an<00:03:11.150> object<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.569> very<00:03:11.750> close<00:03:12.019> to

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
here here's an object is very close to

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.660 
here here's an object is very close to
the<00:03:12.290> lens<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.739> these<00:03:12.950> rays<00:03:13.160> are<00:03:13.280> obviously

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
the lens and these rays are obviously

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.479 
the lens and these rays are obviously
not<00:03:13.760> parallel<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:15.620> let's<00:03:15.799> say<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.099> object

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
not parallel but let's say that object

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.449 
not parallel but let's say that object
is<00:03:16.579> much<00:03:16.760> further<00:03:16.940> away<00:03:18.099> well<00:03:19.099> they're<00:03:19.220> still

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
is much further away well they're still

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.800 
is much further away well they're still
not<00:03:19.579> parallel<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.420> can<00:03:20.540> see<00:03:20.660> they're

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
not parallel but you can see they're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.509 
not parallel but you can see they're
more<00:03:20.989> parallel<00:03:21.349> than<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.620> were<00:03:21.680> before<00:03:21.890> well

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
more parallel than they were before well

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.949 
more parallel than they were before well
this<00:03:22.640> could<00:03:22.790> really<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:23.030> at<00:03:23.150> infinity<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> two

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
this could really be at infinity the two

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.509 
this could really be at infinity the two
days<00:03:24.140> would<00:03:24.319> be<00:03:24.349> perfectly<00:03:24.799> parallel<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:25.430> this

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
days would be perfectly parallel so this

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.619 
days would be perfectly parallel so this
is<00:03:25.640> something<00:03:25.790> else<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.090> need<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.329> know<00:03:26.450> when

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
is something else you need to know when

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.949 
is something else you need to know when
the<00:03:26.690> object<00:03:26.840> is<00:03:27.079> at<00:03:27.260> infinity<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.540> incoming

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
the object is at infinity the incoming

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.030 
the object is at infinity the incoming
rays<00:03:30.260> are<00:03:31.420> all<00:03:32.420> p<00:03:32.720> rates<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:36.410> incoming<00:03:36.769> rays

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
rays are all p rates the incoming rays

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:50.690 
rays are all p rates the incoming rays
are<00:03:37.220> all<00:03:37.310> parallel<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.000> axis

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.309 

all<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.690> Rays<00:03:51.870> will<00:03:52.170> look<00:03:52.290> like<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:54.319> all

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
all the Rays will look like this all

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.220 
all the Rays will look like this all
parallel<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.129> axis<00:03:56.519> okay<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.720> where<00:03:58.200> are

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
parallel to the axis okay and where are

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.900 
parallel to the axis okay and where are
they<00:03:58.379> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.739> from<00:03:59.069> well<00:03:59.580> we<00:03:59.700> just

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
they going to go out from well we just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.860 
they going to go out from well we just
saw<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.239> they're<00:04:00.360> going<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.569> go<00:04:00.629> through<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
saw that they're going to go through the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.509 
saw that they're going to go through the
focal<00:04:01.140> point<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.650> image<00:04:01.920> will<00:04:02.069> be<00:04:02.160> at<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
focal point the image will be at the

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.330 
focal point the image will be at the
focal<00:04:02.819> point<00:04:02.849> over<00:04:03.510> here<00:04:03.709> now<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.040> going

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
focal point over here now this is going

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.400 
focal point over here now this is going
to<00:04:05.400> be<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.550> real<00:04:05.819> image<00:04:06.120> which<00:04:06.900> means<00:04:07.140> it's<00:04:07.319> on

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
to be a real image which means it's on

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.350 
to be a real image which means it's on
the<00:04:07.500> same<00:04:07.709> side<00:04:07.950> as<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.160> outgoing<00:04:08.550> light<00:04:08.819> so

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
the same side as the outgoing light so

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.000 
the same side as the outgoing light so
the<00:04:09.540> image<00:04:09.780> has<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:10.050> be<00:04:10.140> over<00:04:10.319> here<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:10.800> need

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
the image has to be over here so we need

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.100 
the image has to be over here so we need
to<00:04:11.099> use<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.370> focal<00:04:11.760> point<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.690> ray<00:04:12.870> will

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
to use this focal point so this ray will

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.170 
to use this focal point so this ray will
go<00:04:13.200> through<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.440> focal<00:04:13.739> point<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.940> rate

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
go through the focal point this rate

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.030 
go through the focal point this rate
we'll<00:04:15.330> go<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> focal<00:04:16.019> point<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.769> rate

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
we'll go to the focal point this rate

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.289 
we'll go to the focal point this rate
we'll<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.310> through<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.549> focal<00:04:17.850> point<00:04:17.880> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
we'll go through the focal point the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.789 
we'll go through the focal point the
Rays<00:04:18.479> from<00:04:18.630> underneath<00:04:18.959> will<00:04:19.440> come<00:04:19.620> through

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
Rays from underneath will come through

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:43.590 
Rays from underneath will come through
the<00:04:19.859> focal<00:04:20.190> point

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.970 

the<00:04:44.600> outgoing<00:04:44.930> rains<00:04:45.230> will<00:04:45.440> all<00:04:45.500> go<00:04:45.740> through

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
the outgoing rains will all go through

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.790 
the outgoing rains will all go through
the<00:04:46.040> focal<00:04:46.340> point<00:04:49.630> okay<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:51.440> when<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.680> object

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
the focal point okay so when the object

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.830 
the focal point okay so when the object
is<00:04:52.040> going<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.580> be<00:04:52.670> all<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.210> incoming<00:04:53.570> rays

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
is going to be all the incoming rays

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.660 
is going to be all the incoming rays
come<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.230> parallel<00:04:54.710> to<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.890> axis<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.490> all<00:04:55.550> the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
come in parallel to the axis and all the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.300 
come in parallel to the axis and all the
outgoing<00:04:55.820> braids<00:04:56.330> go<00:04:56.600> out<00:04:56.780> into<00:04:57.080> focal<00:04:57.410> points

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.580 

let's<00:05:04.310> also<00:05:04.460> figure<00:05:04.850> out<00:05:05.020> how<00:05:06.020> big<00:05:06.230> this<00:05:06.410> would

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
let's also figure out how big this would

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
let's also figure out how big this would
be<00:05:06.770> well<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.220> magnification<00:05:07.940> is<00:05:08.030> negative<00:05:08.420> I

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
be well the magnification is negative I

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.470 
be well the magnification is negative I
over<00:05:09.140> Oh<00:05:09.490> what<00:05:10.490> am<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.730> going<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.970> plug<00:05:11.120> in<00:05:11.270> for<00:05:11.450> I

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
over Oh what am I going to plug in for I

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.850 
over Oh what am I going to plug in for I
well<00:05:12.020> that's<00:05:12.170> going<00:05:12.320> to<00:05:12.380> be<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.560> focal

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
well that's going to be the focal

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.490 
well that's going to be the focal
distance<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.460> when<00:05:14.150> we<00:05:14.270> plug<00:05:14.450> in<00:05:14.480> 40<00:05:14.810> I'll

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
distance and when we plug in 40 I'll

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.810 
distance and when we plug in 40 I'll
remember<00:05:15.860> we're<00:05:16.010> assuming<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.400> object<00:05:16.730> was

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
remember we're assuming the object was

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.790 
remember we're assuming the object was
that<00:05:16.940> infinity<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.470> what<00:05:18.590> would<00:05:18.710> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
that infinity so what would the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.070 
that infinity so what would the
magnification<00:05:19.490> be<00:05:25.210> what<00:05:26.210> does<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.330> mean<00:05:26.630> it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
magnification be what does that mean it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.720 
magnification be what does that mean it
means<00:05:27.140> that<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.650> image<00:05:27.920> has<00:05:28.070> been<00:05:28.100> shrunk<00:05:28.460> to

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
means that the image has been shrunk to

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.790 
means that the image has been shrunk to
a<00:05:28.760> point<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.870> means<00:05:30.080> it's<00:05:30.230> been<00:05:30.350> shrunk<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.770> the

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
a point it means it's been shrunk to the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.170 
a point it means it's been shrunk to the
point<00:05:31.100> it's<00:05:31.280> been<00:05:31.400> shrunk<00:05:31.580> as<00:05:31.760> much<00:05:31.940> as<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
point it's been shrunk as much as it

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:55.330 
point it's been shrunk as much as it
possibly<00:05:32.540> could<00:05:32.750> be<00:05:32.930> shrunk<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.530> a<00:05:33.560> point

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.670 

okay<00:05:56.090> you<00:05:56.690> can<00:05:56.840> see<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.110> from<00:05:57.199> our<00:05:57.350> picture

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
okay you can see that from our picture

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.189 
okay you can see that from our picture
all<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.699> the<00:05:58.790> rays<00:05:58.970> are<00:05:59.150> converging<00:05:59.660> to<00:06:00.110> the

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
all of the rays are converging to the

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.110 
all of the rays are converging to the
same<00:06:00.410> exact<00:06:00.740> point<00:06:01.040> it's<00:06:01.610> just<00:06:01.699> that<00:06:01.940> whole

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
same exact point it's just that whole

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.580 
same exact point it's just that whole
images<00:06:02.480> is<00:06:02.630> going<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.810> be<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:02.990> one<00:06:03.230> point

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
images is going to be this one point

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.439 
images is going to be this one point
over<00:06:04.010> here<00:06:04.040> this<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:04.729> kind<00:06:04.940> of<00:06:04.970> common<00:06:05.270> sense

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
over here this is kind of common sense

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.210 
over here this is kind of common sense
if<00:06:05.750> the<00:06:06.080> object<00:06:06.410> is<00:06:06.470> infinitely<00:06:06.889> far<00:06:07.160> away

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
if the object is infinitely far away

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.340 
if the object is infinitely far away
it's<00:06:08.000> going<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.210> be<00:06:08.300> tiny<00:06:08.540> the<00:06:08.870> image<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:09.199> going

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
it's going to be tiny the image is going

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.520 
it's going to be tiny the image is going
to<00:06:09.410> be<00:06:09.470> tiny<00:06:09.790> absolutely<00:06:10.790> far<00:06:10.940> away<00:06:11.120> image

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
to be tiny absolutely far away image

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.439 
to be tiny absolutely far away image
objects<00:06:12.530> given<00:06:12.800> a<00:06:12.979> tiny<00:06:13.610> image<00:06:13.970> over<00:06:14.419> here

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
objects given a tiny image over here

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.120 
objects given a tiny image over here
okay<00:06:15.380> so<00:06:15.440> these<00:06:15.590> are<00:06:15.740> things<00:06:15.949> that<00:06:16.010> actually

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
okay so these are things that actually

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.219 
okay so these are things that actually
come<00:06:16.430> up<00:06:16.460> a<00:06:16.610> lot<00:06:16.729> on<00:06:17.000> exams<00:06:17.840> when<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.139> object

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
come up a lot on exams when the object

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.900 
come up a lot on exams when the object
side<00:06:18.500> infinity<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.220> incoming<00:06:19.490> rays<00:06:19.729> are

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
side infinity to incoming rays are

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.909 
side infinity to incoming rays are
parallel<00:06:20.120> to<00:06:20.449> the<00:06:20.540> axis<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.620> outgoing

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
parallel to the axis so the outgoing

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.860 
parallel to the axis so the outgoing
raised<00:06:22.160> go<00:06:22.400> to<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.610> focal<00:06:22.910> point<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.600> image

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
raised go to the focal point the image

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.990 
raised go to the focal point the image
is<00:06:24.020> shrunk<00:06:24.199> to<00:06:24.350> a<00:06:24.410> point<00:06:24.680> we<00:06:25.550> kind<00:06:25.729> of<00:06:25.760> showed

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
is shrunk to a point we kind of showed

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.280 
is shrunk to a point we kind of showed
that<00:06:26.150> in<00:06:26.270> the<00:06:26.360> lens<00:06:26.540> mirror<00:06:26.720> equation<00:06:27.199> but

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
that in the lens mirror equation but

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.620 
that in the lens mirror equation but
that's<00:06:27.440> also<00:06:27.620> good<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.160> know<00:06:28.479> let's<00:06:29.479> take<00:06:29.570> a

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
that's also good to know let's take a

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:37.710 
that's also good to know let's take a
look<00:06:29.840> at<00:06:29.930> our<00:06:30.020> lens<00:06:30.380> mirror<00:06:30.650> chart<00:06:30.979> up<00:06:31.160> here

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.180 

we're<00:06:38.720> doing<00:06:38.870> with<00:06:39.050> converging<00:06:39.590> device<00:06:39.889> and

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
we're doing with converging device and

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.180 
we're doing with converging device and
where<00:06:40.880> are<00:06:41.090> we<00:06:41.120> in<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.900> chart<00:06:42.229> well<00:06:42.860> aren't

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
where are we in this chart well aren't

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.640 
where are we in this chart well aren't
we<00:06:43.220> way<00:06:43.610> far<00:06:43.850> out<00:06:43.910> over<00:06:44.479> here<00:06:44.750> right<00:06:45.350> because

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
we way far out over here right because

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.730 
we way far out over here right because
we're<00:06:45.889> at<00:06:45.979> infinity<00:06:46.460> way<00:06:46.850> far<00:06:47.120> out<00:06:47.150> past<00:06:47.630> 2f<00:06:48.050> if

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
we're at infinity way far out past 2f if

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.200 
we're at infinity way far out past 2f if
you<00:06:48.889> look<00:06:48.979> at<00:06:49.070> the<00:06:49.220> chart<00:06:49.460> here<00:06:49.639> notice<00:06:50.030> that

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
you look at the chart here notice that

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.120 
you look at the chart here notice that
remember<00:06:50.660> magnified<00:06:51.350> is<00:06:51.530> in<00:06:51.650> the<00:06:51.740> middle<00:06:51.889> and

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
remember magnified is in the middle and

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.219 
remember magnified is in the middle and
shrunk<00:06:52.610> is<00:06:52.729> on<00:06:52.850> the<00:06:52.970> edges<00:06:53.300> well<00:06:53.900> something<00:06:54.139> we

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
shrunk is on the edges well something we

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.719 
shrunk is on the edges well something we
didn't<00:06:54.470> talk<00:06:54.560> about<00:06:54.740> with<00:06:55.100> what<00:06:55.370> that<00:06:55.490> means

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
didn't talk about with what that means

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:58.330 
didn't talk about with what that means
is<00:06:55.940> the<00:06:56.539> further<00:06:56.960> you<00:06:57.080> go<00:06:57.470> towards<00:06:58.070> the<00:06:58.160> edges

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
is the further you go towards the edges

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.580 
is the further you go towards the edges
of<00:06:58.550> the<00:06:58.669> chart<00:06:59.000> the<00:06:59.570> more<00:06:59.780> shrunk<00:07:00.169> the<00:07:00.320> image

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
of the chart the more shrunk the image

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.500 
of the chart the more shrunk the image
is<00:07:00.710> going<00:07:00.950> to<00:07:01.039> be<00:07:01.190> and<00:07:01.430> the<00:07:01.910> further<00:07:02.120> you<00:07:02.270> go

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
is going to be and the further you go

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410 
magnification would be infinite because

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.540 
magnification would be infinite because
this<00:07:15.680> is<00:07:15.800> a<00:07:15.860> very<00:07:15.979> middle<00:07:16.340> of<00:07:16.430> the

so<00:07:25.610> that's<00:07:25.729> good<00:07:25.910> to<00:07:26.000> know<00:07:26.030> the<00:07:26.570> further<00:07:26.780> we<00:07:26.870> go

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
so that's good to know the further we go

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.110 
so that's good to know the further we go
to<00:07:27.110> the<00:07:27.260> sides<00:07:27.500> the<00:07:27.830> smaller<00:07:28.460> the<00:07:28.669> image<00:07:28.910> is

little bit in the hand out right at this
point<00:07:37.840> if<00:07:38.840> you<00:07:39.020> put<00:07:39.169> the<00:07:39.260> object<00:07:39.620> of<00:07:39.680> the<00:07:39.770> hope

infinite<00:07:41.599> you<00:07:41.840> guys<00:07:41.990> should<00:07:42.110> also<00:07:42.320> added<00:07:42.740> out

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099 
infinite you guys should also added out

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:44.710 
infinite you guys should also added out
here<00:07:43.520> when<00:07:43.760> it's<00:07:43.910> at<00:07:44.030> infinity<00:07:44.539> the

here when it's at infinity the
magnification<00:07:45.320> is<00:07:45.410> 0<00:07:45.620> I've<00:07:46.430> got<00:07:46.669> yourself<00:07:47.030> ok

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.940 

I<00:08:03.030> showed<00:08:03.660> this<00:08:03.810> for<00:08:04.020> converging<00:08:04.530> lens<00:08:04.740> but

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:04.950 
I showed this for converging lens but

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.400 
I showed this for converging lens but
have<00:08:05.070> also<00:08:05.220> worked<00:08:05.460> for<00:08:05.640> a<00:08:05.760> converging<00:08:06.270> mirror

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.410 
have also worked for a converging mirror

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.360 
have also worked for a converging mirror
all<00:08:07.410> this<00:08:07.680> stuff<00:08:07.860> about<00:08:07.950> the<00:08:08.340> the<00:08:09.150> Rays
