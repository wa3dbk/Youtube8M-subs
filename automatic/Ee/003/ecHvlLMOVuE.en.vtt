00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
me

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.110 
me
dude<00:00:14.010> we<00:00:14.099> started<00:00:14.370> talking<00:00:14.639> about<00:00:14.880> if<00:00:15.000> we

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
dude we started talking about if we

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.820 
dude we started talking about if we
could<00:00:15.300> start<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.780> project<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.379> own<00:00:16.529> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
could start a project on our own and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
could start a project on our own and
what<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.430> would<00:00:17.520> look<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.850> doing<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.450> if<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
what we would look to be doing and if it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
what we would look to be doing and if it
was<00:00:19.529> even<00:00:19.650> feasible<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.490> uh<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> four<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
was even feasible for uh for the four of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.970 
was even feasible for uh for the four of
us<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.689> put<00:00:22.110> something<00:00:22.259> together<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
us to put something together and so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.589 
us to put something together and so
that's<00:00:23.189> kind<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.759> idea<00:00:24.060> was<00:00:24.240> born<00:00:24.450> to

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
that's kind of when the idea was born to

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.679 
that's kind of when the idea was born to
create<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.650> later<00:00:26.009> became<00:00:26.279> solstice<00:00:29.600> so<00:00:30.600> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
create what later became solstice so the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.439 
create what later became solstice so the
name<00:00:30.900> derived<00:00:31.439> from<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.360> relationship<00:00:33.360> of

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
name derived from the relationship of

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.680 
name derived from the relationship of
the<00:00:33.540> Sun<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.620> food<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.010> eat<00:00:35.330> so<00:00:36.330> we<00:00:36.449> really
