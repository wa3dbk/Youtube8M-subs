00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
oi firstly okay if this might be a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
oi firstly okay if this might be a
little<00:00:11.670> bit<00:00:11.790> harder<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.300> hand<00:00:12.480> okay<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:13.559> have

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
little bit harder from hand okay so have

little bit harder from hand okay so have
your<00:00:13.889> Kabbalah<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.210> want<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> do

your Kabbalah here what you want to do

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.080 
your Kabbalah here what you want to do
is<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.900> lay<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.490> you<00:00:17.490> find<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> center

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
is you lay it out you find the center

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.290 
is you lay it out you find the center
point<00:00:18.240> usually<00:00:19.020> there's<00:00:19.619> different<00:00:20.520> kind<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
point usually there's different kind of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
point usually there's different kind of
beads<00:00:21.600> there<00:00:22.010> that<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.310> mark<00:00:23.580> where<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
beads there that the mark where the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.210 
beads there that the mark where the
center<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> once<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.910> figure<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> out

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
center is so once you figure that out

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.679 
center is so once you figure that out
the<00:00:29.220> center<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.880> meaning<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.420> number<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the center not meaning the number of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.290 
the center not meaning the number of
beads<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.260> more<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.710> way<00:00:32.070> twice<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:33.149> as

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
beads but more like way twice because as

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
beads but more like way twice because as
you<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.870> less<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you see there is less here than here but

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.459 
you see there is less here than here but
wait<00:00:35.700> why<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.180> should<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> same<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
wait why is it should be the same so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
wait why is it should be the same so
once<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> found<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> center<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.760> here

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
once you found the center you put here

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
once you found the center you put here
and<00:00:39.230> then<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.379> put<00:00:40.620> between<00:00:41.090> your<00:00:42.800> your<00:00:43.800> index

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and then you put between your your index

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.000 
and then you put between your your index
finger<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> middle<00:00:45.120> finger<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.739> have

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
finger and the middle finger so you have

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
finger and the middle finger so you have
them<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.600> just

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
them here and what you do is you just

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
them here and what you do is you just
will<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.270> then<00:00:51.890> slightly<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
will like this and then slightly you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
will like this and then slightly you
bring<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.850> back<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.789> well<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> used<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
bring it back like that well I'm used to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.010 
bring it back like that well I'm used to
doing<00:00:58.710> faster<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> thing<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
doing faster so the thing is you just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.670 
doing faster so the thing is you just
keep<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.409> flip

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
keep on going look at this it's one flip

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
keep on going look at this it's one flip
after<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.670> you've<00:01:05.820> had<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
after the other so once you've had it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.280 
after the other so once you've had it
flip<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.820> pull<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.299> rest<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.780> hand<00:01:09.930> back

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
flip you pull the rest of your hand back

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
flip you pull the rest of your hand back
so<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> puts<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.180> front<00:01:14.299> but<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so that it puts it in front but when I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
so that it puts it in front but when I
do<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.840> slow<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.470> confused<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> can't

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
do it slow I get confused and I can't

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
do it slow I get confused and I can't
even<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> anymore<00:01:21.320> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
even do it anymore this is one way of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070 
even do it anymore this is one way of
playing<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.490> couple<00:01:23.640> oi<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.720> other<00:01:24.810> ways

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
playing a couple oi there are other ways

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
playing a couple oi there are other ways
that<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> actually<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.490> through<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> whole

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that you actually go through the whole

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.469 
that you actually go through the whole
hand<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:28.369> too<00:01:29.369> complicated<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.939> me<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
hand that's too complicated for me and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.679 
hand that's too complicated for me and
I'm<00:01:30.630> guessing<00:01:30.990> even<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
I'm guessing even more so for you so and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
I'm guessing even more so for you so and
by<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> end<00:01:34.680> usually<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.610> turns<00:01:36.119> into<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
by the end usually this turns into a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.600 
by the end usually this turns into a
like<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> rope<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:38.220> makes<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
like a rope like this which makes it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.260 
like a rope like this which makes it
easier<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:44.310> faster<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> can

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
easier and you just go faster as you can

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.060 
easier and you just go faster as you can
I<00:01:45.509> haven't<00:01:46.229> done<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> couple<00:01:47.040> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
I haven't done this for a couple of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.130 
I haven't done this for a couple of
months<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.939> rusty<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:49.020> get

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
months I'm a little rusty but you get

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
months I'm a little rusty but you get
the<00:01:49.259> gist<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> start<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the gist of it so you start like this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
the gist of it so you start like this
hold<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.360> start<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hold here you start like this or you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.990 
hold here you start like this or you
hold<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:57.149> bring<00:01:57.420> over

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.940 

how's<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.900> have<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.140> bring<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.470> over

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
how's it you have to bring it over

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.300 
how's it you have to bring it over
Oh

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390 

and<00:02:13.850> figure

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.210 

again<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.110> you're<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.959> drop<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:25.220> ready

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
again so you're here you drop it ready

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.670 
again so you're here you drop it ready
to<00:02:26.310> come<00:02:26.489> back

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.980 

the<00:02:33.680> point<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.040> start<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.780> first<00:02:35.780> step

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
the point is start with the first step
