get faster at paradiddles how fast can

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
get faster at paradiddles how fast can
you<00:00:37.140> sing<00:00:37.410> pair<00:00:37.620> those<00:00:37.829> peridot<00:00:38.550> peridot

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you sing pair those peridot peridot

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790

peridot pehla pehla pehla okay may be

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
peridot pehla pehla pehla okay may be
tough<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> articulate<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.329> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
tough to articulate that but what if you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
tough to articulate that but what if you
just<00:00:42.540> said<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.020> syllable<00:00:43.290> prepare

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
just said the first syllable prepare

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.920 
just said the first syllable prepare
pepper<00:00:44.370> pepper<00:00:44.640> pair<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:45.600> move<00:00:45.780> your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
pepper pepper pair then maybe move your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.090 
pepper pepper pair then maybe move your
hands<00:00:46.110> along<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> pepperin<00:00:47.070> pepperin

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
hands along to it pepperin pepperin

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
hands along to it pepperin pepperin
pepperin<00:00:47.370> pepperin<00:00:47.640> pair<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.629> least<00:00:48.750> have

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
pepperin pepperin pair so at least have

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
pepperin pepperin pair so at least have
some<00:00:48.989> sort<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> idea<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
some sort of idea of what that is and I

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.580 
some sort of idea of what that is and I
would<00:00:51.420> recommend<00:00:51.600> sort<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> clocking<00:00:52.559> that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
would recommend sort of clocking that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.310 
would recommend sort of clocking that
tempo<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.449> give<00:00:54.600> yourself<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.960> concrete

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
tempo to really give yourself a concrete

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
tempo to really give yourself a concrete
idea<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.550> clock<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.000> let's<00:00:57.180> say

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
idea so you you clock that let's say

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200 
idea so you you clock that let's say
it's<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.930> eighth<00:00:58.350> notes<00:00:58.649> at<00:00:58.859> 200<00:00:59.640> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it's you know eighth notes at 200 but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
it's you know eighth notes at 200 but
then<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.629> via<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> metronome<00:01:01.859> exactly

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
then you know via a metronome exactly

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
then you know via a metronome exactly
how<00:01:02.609> fast<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.480> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.350> an

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
how fast you need to go so you have an

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
how fast you need to go so you have an
idea<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> where<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.369> let's<00:01:05.580> say<00:01:05.700> you're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
idea of where you are let's say you're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
idea of where you are let's say you're
like<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.180> 130<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> want

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
like at 130 right now you know you want

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
like at 130 right now you know you want
to<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> 200<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to get to 200 so you know you have this

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
to get to 200 so you know you have this
much<00:01:09.869> distance<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.350> travel<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.799> basically

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
much distance to travel it's basically

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
much distance to travel it's basically
giving<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.820> mental<00:01:12.510> roadmap<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> where<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
giving you a mental roadmap of where you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
giving you a mental roadmap of where you
want<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> very<00:01:15.150> solid<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:15.979> concrete

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
want to go so a very solid very concrete

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
want to go so a very solid very concrete
idea<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.479> need<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
idea of I'm here and I need to get to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.340 
idea of I'm here and I need to get to
here<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.310> step<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.060> step<00:01:21.350> two

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
here that's really step one and step two

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
here that's really step one and step two
is<00:01:22.560> starting<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> realize<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.700> moves

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
is starting to realize what moves

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.060 
is starting to realize what moves
quickly<00:01:24.240> okay<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.530> being<00:01:25.740> able<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
quickly okay so really being able to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
quickly okay so really being able to
isolate<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:27.000> fingers<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
isolate your fingers because that's the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
isolate your fingers because that's the
muscles<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.380> move<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> fastest<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
muscles that move the fastest so a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
muscles that move the fastest so a
simple<00:01:30.450> thing<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.680> finger

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
simple thing to do is just some finger

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
simple thing to do is just some finger
isolation<00:01:32.759> things<00:01:32.970> okay<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.290> we're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
isolation things okay so what we're

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260 
isolation things okay so what we're
going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> left<00:01:35.100> hand<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> isolate

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
going to do on the left hand is isolate

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.200 
going to do on the left hand is isolate
our<00:01:36.360> thumb<00:01:36.630> index<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.680> middle<00:01:38.610> finger<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
our thumb index and middle finger so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:51.460 
our thumb index and middle finger so
just<00:01:39.390> simple<00:01:39.659> things<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.930> this

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.360 

okay<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.010> great<00:01:53.130> way<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
okay and that's just a great way to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.970 
okay and that's just a great way to
start<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.760> understand<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:55.530> fingers

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
start to understand how your fingers

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.800 
start to understand how your fingers
move<00:01:56.190> okay<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.150> right<00:01:57.570> hand

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
move okay and then in the right hand

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
move okay and then in the right hand
very<00:01:58.500> similar<00:01:58.860> we're<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.190> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.370> do

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
very similar we're just going to do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
very similar we're just going to do
fulcrum<00:02:00.090> middle<00:02:00.720> ring<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.320> pinkie<00:02:09.560> okay<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
fulcrum middle ring and pinkie okay and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.500 
fulcrum middle ring and pinkie okay and
once<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.430> start<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.850> an<00:02:12.000> idea<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> how

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
once you start to have an idea of how

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.540 
once you start to have an idea of how
those<00:02:12.690> move<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:14.010> start<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> apply

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
those move then you can start to apply

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.150 
those move then you can start to apply
that<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.480> different<00:02:16.110> rudiments<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.800> forth

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that to different rudiments and so forth

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.980 
that to different rudiments and so forth
okay<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:18.270> important<00:02:18.690> note<00:02:18.810> that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
okay so just really important note that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.420 
okay so just really important note that
the<00:02:19.110> fingers<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.650> what's<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.010> help<00:02:20.190> you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the fingers are what's going to help you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.660 
the fingers are what's going to help you
move<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.210> lot<00:02:21.480> faster<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:22.170> times<00:02:22.380> okay<00:02:23.040> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
move a lot faster at times okay so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.610 
move a lot faster at times okay so
here's<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.000> great<00:02:24.240> exercise<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:25.110> apply<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
here's a great exercise to apply to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.640 
here's a great exercise to apply to
let's<00:02:26.580> say<00:02:26.760> pair<00:02:27.090> those<00:02:27.330> okay<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> what<00:02:28.470> this

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
let's say pair those okay and what this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.860 
let's say pair those okay and what this
concept<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.300> time<00:02:30.510> so

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
concept is is really one at a time so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.140 
concept is is really one at a time so
short<00:02:31.230> bursts<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.680> speed<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.820> want<00:02:33.030> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
short bursts of speed you really want to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.060 
short bursts of speed you really want to
learn<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> feels<00:02:34.350> like<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.830> play

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
learn what it feels like to play

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.150 
learn what it feels like to play
something<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.580> quick<00:02:35.820> as<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.560> once<00:02:37.560> okay

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
something as quick as you can once okay

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
something as quick as you can once okay
so<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.640> again<00:02:38.880> like<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.090> quick<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:39.930> little

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
so it's again like a quick little little

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.290 
so it's again like a quick little little
sort<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.830> sort<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> eek<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.760> out<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> will

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
sort of sort of eek it out if you will

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.730 
sort of sort of eek it out if you will
so<00:02:42.540> I'm<00:02:42.960> going<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> try<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.260> play<00:02:43.500> one

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
so I'm going to try to play one

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.979 
so I'm going to try to play one
paradiddle<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.370> fast<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.790> possibly<00:02:44.820> can

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.940 

it's<00:02:51.989> important<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.500> note<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.709> I'm<00:02:52.920> not

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it's important to note that I'm not

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
it's important to note that I'm not
really<00:02:53.310> worried<00:02:53.580> about<00:02:53.670> how<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> sounds<00:02:54.570> right

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
really worried about how it sounds right

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.510 
really worried about how it sounds right
now<00:02:54.930> because<00:02:55.500> I'm<00:02:55.739> trying<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.070> get<00:02:56.160> faster

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
now because I'm trying to get faster

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.120 
now because I'm trying to get faster
certainly<00:02:56.910> quality<00:02:57.330> does<00:02:57.570> matter<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.950> in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
certainly quality does matter but not in

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
certainly quality does matter but not in
this<00:02:59.280> stage<00:02:59.550> okay<00:03:00.000> we'll<00:03:00.209> start<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> add<00:03:01.020> that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
this stage okay we'll start to add that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
this stage okay we'll start to add that
later<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.770> get<00:03:01.920> more<00:03:02.070> comfortable<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:03.090> I'm

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
later as you get more comfortable so I'm

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.300 
later as you get more comfortable so I'm
going<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> teach<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.020> an<00:03:04.110> exercise<00:03:04.530> that's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
going to teach you an exercise that's

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.310 
going to teach you an exercise that's
out<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.550> my<00:03:05.610> book<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.940> next<00:03:06.120> level<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.600> it's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
out of my book the next level and it's

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.260 
out of my book the next level and it's
basically<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.860> four<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:08.520> type<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.090> exercise

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
basically a four to one type of exercise

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.630 
basically a four to one type of exercise
so<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:09.840> basically<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.560> large<00:03:11.010> chunk<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.550> we

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so it's basically a large chunk that we

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.400 
so it's basically a large chunk that we
then<00:03:11.790> cut<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.120> half<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:12.780> then<00:03:12.930> cut<00:03:13.290> in

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
then cut in half that we then cut in

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
then cut in half that we then cut in
half<00:03:13.590> basically<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.510> four

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
half basically so it's going to be four

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.810 
half basically so it's going to be four
petals<00:03:16.050> on<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.260> downbeat<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:17.250> pedals<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
petals on the downbeat for pedals on the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820 
petals on the downbeat for pedals on the
upbeat<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.480> I'm<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.200> play<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.530> one

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
upbeat and I'm going to play that one

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.229 
upbeat and I'm going to play that one
measure<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.160> each<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.640> then<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
measure of each and then it's going to

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.760 
measure of each and then it's going to
cut<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.720> half<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.080> it'll<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.290> two<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.620> two

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
cut that in half so it'll be two and two

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.390 
cut that in half so it'll be two and two
twice<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.520> then<00:03:24.270> one<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.810> 1/4<00:03:25.709> times<00:03:26.070> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
twice and then one and 1/4 times and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.770 
twice and then one and 1/4 times and

a couple things to know I'm not worried

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.380 
a couple things to know I'm not worried
about<00:04:00.680> how<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.040> sounds<00:04:01.459> whatever<00:04:02.180> I've<00:04:02.360> done

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
about how it sounds whatever I've done

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.660 
about how it sounds whatever I've done
to<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.900> point<00:04:03.170> has<00:04:03.620> allowed<00:04:03.890> me<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.130> sound<00:04:04.550> as

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
to this point has allowed me to sound as

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.730 
to this point has allowed me to sound as
good<00:04:04.700> as<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.300> at<00:04:05.570> whatever<00:04:05.900> tempo<00:04:06.440> on<00:04:06.560> that

good as I can at whatever tempo on that
okay<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.310> I'm<00:04:07.520> not<00:04:07.580> going<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.850> worry<00:04:08.000> about

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
okay so I'm not going to worry about

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
that I'm also not going to worry about

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.140 
that I'm also not going to worry about
my<00:04:09.680> technique<00:04:09.920> too<00:04:10.280> much<00:04:10.459> in<00:04:10.610> fact<00:04:10.760> I'm<00:04:11.000> going

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
my technique too much in fact I'm going

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.780 
my technique too much in fact I'm going
to<00:04:11.209> try<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.840> do<00:04:12.260> different<00:04:12.709> things<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.520> can

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
to try to do different things so I can

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.850 
to try to do different things so I can
start<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.120> understand<00:04:14.660> ways<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.440> get<00:04:15.650> outside

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
start to understand ways to get outside

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.490 
start to understand ways to get outside
of<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:16.430> current<00:04:16.850> comfort<00:04:17.060> zone<00:04:17.390> okay<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.959> I

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
of my current comfort zone okay and I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.990 
of my current comfort zone okay and I
may<00:04:18.739> find<00:04:18.980> that<00:04:19.100> some<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.340> those<00:04:19.430> work<00:04:19.669> I<00:04:19.820> may

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
may find that some of those work I may

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.250 
may find that some of those work I may
find<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.299> they<00:04:20.419> don't<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:20.780> that's<00:04:20.900> really

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
find that they don't but that's really

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.630 
find that they don't but that's really
not<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.440> point<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.950> point<00:04:22.130> is<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> just

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
not the point the point is to just

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.510 
not the point the point is to just
really<00:04:22.790> go<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.900> try<00:04:24.530> to<00:04:24.590> make<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:24.980> as<00:04:25.100> fast<00:04:25.310> as

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
really go and try to make it as fast as

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.980 
really go and try to make it as fast as
I<00:04:25.610> possibly<00:04:25.640> can<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.390> I'll<00:04:26.480> go<00:04:26.570> okay<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:26.900> was

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
I possibly can and I'll go okay what was

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.050 
I possibly can and I'll go okay what was
I<00:04:27.080> doing<00:04:27.140> there<00:04:27.350> well<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:27.950> did<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.250> little<00:04:28.520> woody

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
I doing there well I did a little woody

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.909 
I doing there well I did a little woody
thing<00:04:29.419> here<00:04:29.630> okay<00:04:29.930> cool<00:04:30.140> let's<00:04:30.470> maybe<00:04:30.650> see

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
thing here okay cool let's maybe see

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.560 
thing here okay cool let's maybe see
what<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.400> does<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.000> make<00:04:32.210> sense<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
what that is does that make sense to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.030 
what that is does that make sense to
continue<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.380> on<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:33.680> forth<00:04:33.890> so

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
continue to do so on and so forth so

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.790 
continue to do so on and so forth so
this<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.340> really<00:04:34.580> kind<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.450> almost<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
this is really kind of a almost a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.650 
this is really kind of a almost a
free-thinking<00:04:37.220> sort<00:04:37.669> of<00:04:37.730> zone<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.390> really

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
free-thinking sort of zone but really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.390 
free-thinking sort of zone but really
just<00:04:38.840> go<00:04:39.110> for<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.740> bottom<00:04:40.010> line<00:04:40.160> so

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
just go for it is the bottom line so

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.460 
just go for it is the bottom line so
here<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.790> as<00:04:41.240> fast<00:04:41.600> as<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.930> possibly<00:04:42.320> can

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
here it is as fast as I possibly can

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:52.879 
here it is as fast as I possibly can
play<00:04:42.650> that

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.399 

okay<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.060> just<00:04:54.270> try<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.449> play<00:04:54.719> it<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.050> quick

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
okay so just try to play it really quick

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.010 
okay so just try to play it really quick
okay<00:04:56.069> and<00:04:56.280> did<00:04:56.849> it<00:04:56.969> sound<00:04:57.150> good<00:04:57.389> there<00:04:57.870> was<00:04:57.930> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
okay and did it sound good there was a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.570 
okay and did it sound good there was a
couple<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.349> maybe<00:04:58.530> sounded<00:04:58.860> okay<00:04:59.129> but<00:04:59.370> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
couple that maybe sounded okay but you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.800 
couple that maybe sounded okay but you
know<00:04:59.639> when<00:04:59.759> I<00:04:59.789> really<00:05:00.090> got<00:05:00.300> going<00:05:00.479> there<00:05:00.689> at

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
know when I really got going there at

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.029 
know when I really got going there at
the<00:05:00.930> end<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.289> was<00:05:01.409> it<00:05:01.710> was<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:01.860> little

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
the end it was it was a little

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.189 
the end it was it was a little
questionable<00:05:02.430> with<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.669> quality<00:05:03.060> okay<00:05:03.629> but

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
questionable with the quality okay but

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.839 
questionable with the quality okay but
that's<00:05:04.379> again<00:05:04.710> not<00:05:04.740> what<00:05:05.099> my<00:05:05.189> focus<00:05:05.400> was<00:05:05.669> my

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
that's again not what my focus was my

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.790 
that's again not what my focus was my
focus<00:05:06.030> was<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.360> play<00:05:06.659> it<00:05:06.719> as<00:05:06.870> fast<00:05:07.110> as<00:05:07.259> possible

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
focus was to play it as fast as possible

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.920 
focus was to play it as fast as possible
so<00:05:07.949> you<00:05:08.340> can<00:05:08.520> certainly<00:05:08.729> apply<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.389> exercise

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
so you can certainly apply that exercise

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.110 
so you can certainly apply that exercise
to<00:05:10.289> anything<00:05:11.219> you<00:05:11.400> can<00:05:11.580> learn<00:05:11.699> to<00:05:11.879> play<00:05:12.090> a

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
to anything you can learn to play a

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:28.719 
to anything you can learn to play a
short<00:05:12.419> little<00:05:12.599> burst<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.900> singles<00:05:27.680> and

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
short little burst of singles and

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.100 
short little burst of singles and
anything<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:29.879> can<00:05:30.000> sort<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.300> throw<00:05:30.479> into<00:05:30.870> that

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
anything you can sort of throw into that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.559 
anything you can sort of throw into that
little<00:05:31.529> exercise<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.340> start<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.909> work<00:05:33.090> again

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
little exercise to start to work again

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.540 
little exercise to start to work again
short<00:05:33.900> bursts<00:05:34.409> of<00:05:34.529> speed<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.069> that's

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
short bursts of speed and that's
