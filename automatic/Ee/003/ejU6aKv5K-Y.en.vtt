00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.149
 to prove it I come to bring you some 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.960
 very good textures that are very 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:11.060
 realistic and here we have more or less 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.710
 how can a zombie see a scream of 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.850
 respect and some little pigs are 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.300
 because we have to the side 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.220
 very good 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:29.169
 ChristÃ³bal water moves 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.169
 with the torch and this 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.210
 I have one hour 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.210
 sky 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.030
 this is with the head and if I take it out 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.200
 is my head 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.520
 It changes quite the win and is very good 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 although the other head 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.140
 and the one in Cleveland 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 and over the glasses this compound with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.309
 the big style of google and he puts it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.309
 in the skeleton for example 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.740
 look 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.040
 It is so beautiful 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.210
 and then we will now make this setter 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 diamond fabric 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.539
 and I think this is the little frog 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.800
 this option to find but now 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.050
 we have a pig a spider 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.950
 the rain are reflections and they are very 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.630
 realistic 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.630
 in the wood very good 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.010
 flowers 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 then it catches fire 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480
 by the effect of fire 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.659
 happen that other things I can show you 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.659
 the blocks 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.000
 is the pumpkin that is 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.630
 how good is it smelling 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.390
 well I just cut the gameplay and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.230
 here I leave you a tutorial of how 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.269
 install the textures 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.819
 if you do not know and if you can not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.159
 forward the video at the end that I'm going to 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.440
 leave some images of what the 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.239
 textures and all for that for 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.580
 enjoy 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.580
 see you later and now let's continue with this 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.420
 well there it is once I know 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.300
 downloaded here 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.599
 download they download it they will have it 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.599
 here they will transfer it to the desk 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.180
 I already have it good 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.190
 to pp data or percent that peratta and 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.350
 I'm going to give you pointed minecraft and we're going to 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.780
 go where pack was detected in here I 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.610
 I have the mild potts 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.610
 realism x 64 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.840
 and you are going to have it blank for 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.340
 have other textures 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.340
 in the case that they have other 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.260
 what to do is to grab not local power 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.569
 and ready 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.569
 now I'm going to open the minecraft 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.720
 okay 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.930
 good once the s 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.650
 once the main craft is opened 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.950
 measure where it says options but does not say the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.320
 text pax and here you have to appear the 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.630
 future links and if it does not disappear is 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.660
 because they put it wrong or something wrong 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.760
 they did look and come back and put 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.640
 served to try the missing waters but 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.799
 comment and I will try to help 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.590
 good to click on it and it's going to 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.060
 work more or less 510 seconds and already 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.410
 is because you have to load the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.480
 textures 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.680

 we are going to double click to confirm 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.740
 that they are fine 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.740
 and how to see there we already have the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.130
 textures 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.520
