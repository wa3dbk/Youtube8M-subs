the<00:02:13.360> second<00:02:13.720> riff<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> groove<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> we

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the second riff is the groove that we

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.770 
the second riff is the groove that we

riff<00:02:17.019> seems<00:02:17.230> quite<00:02:17.470> straightforward<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
riff seems quite straightforward but it

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.920 
riff seems quite straightforward but it
is<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.760> fact<00:02:18.790> entirely<00:02:19.450> made<00:02:19.720> up<00:02:19.840> of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.020 
is in fact entirely made up of

back on the bridge almost so that you're

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.449 
back on the bridge almost so that you're
not<00:03:03.880> even<00:03:04.000> part<00:03:04.299> muting<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:04.810> all<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:06.040> creates

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
not even part muting at all this creates

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.370 
not even part muting at all this creates
a<00:03:06.579> saying<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.910> we<00:03:07.090> affectionally<00:03:07.599> have<00:03:07.810> like

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
repetition we choke the note as much as

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.860 
repetition we choke the note as much as
we<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.819> to<00:03:13.060> create<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.420> very<00:03:13.630> tight

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
we can to create a very tight

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.229 
we can to create a very tight
syncopation<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.769> technique-wise<00:03:15.730> this

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239

from our song timeframes this is pretty

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.090 
from our song timeframes this is pretty
much<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> only<00:04:12.990> point<00:04:13.200> on<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:13.980> record

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
much the only point on the on the record

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.070 
much the only point on the on the record
that<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.430> get<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.670> cut<00:04:14.850> loose<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.150> little<00:04:15.270> bit<00:04:15.450> so

solo over it's a steady 12-8 feel with a
basic<00:04:22.049> slow<00:04:22.410> chord<00:04:22.800> progression<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.370> play

around<00:04:23.730> first<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.840> all<00:04:24.960> I'll<00:04:25.110> show<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.380> how<00:04:25.560> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
around first of all I'll show you how it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:42.950 
around first of all I'll show you how it
sounds<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.430> looks

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.760 

right<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.139> although<00:04:44.289> it's<00:04:44.469> fairly<00:04:44.620> short

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
right so although it's fairly short

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.040 
right so although it's fairly short
there's<00:04:45.249> a<00:04:45.280> lot<00:04:45.460> going<00:04:45.729> on<00:04:45.849> briefly<00:04:46.629> it<00:04:46.780> can<00:04:46.900> be

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
there's a lot going on briefly it can be

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.869 
there's a lot going on briefly it can be
broken<00:04:47.229> down<00:04:47.439> into<00:04:47.590> four<00:04:48.039> parts<00:04:48.280> though<00:04:48.550> so

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879
