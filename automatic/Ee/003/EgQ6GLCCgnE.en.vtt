173 300 300 what what you mean top speed
over<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.310> time<00:01:25.490> we<00:01:25.610> get<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.909> garage<00:01:26.300> I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
over the time we get to the garage I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.660 
over the time we get to the garage I

reckon by the time we get to garrage

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.999 
reckon by the time we get to garrage
we'll<00:01:28.819> hit<00:01:28.970> 180<00:01:29.330> possibly<00:01:32.470> top<00:01:33.470> speed<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.800> this

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
we'll hit 180 possibly top speed of this

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.029 
we'll hit 180 possibly top speed of this
thing<00:01:34.250> now<00:01:34.399> in<00:01:34.729> 20<00:01:35.090> second<00:01:35.479> gear<00:01:35.659> I've<00:01:36.380> turned
