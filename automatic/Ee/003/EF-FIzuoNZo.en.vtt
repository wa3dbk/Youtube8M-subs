North<00:01:04.050> American<00:01:04.410> music<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> lot<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> times<00:01:05.190> but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
North American music a lot of times but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.109 
guess he's sort of American something
latin-american<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.670> he's<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:11.940> of<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
latin-american but he's one of my

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.580 
latin-american but he's one of my
favorites<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.660> really<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> words<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.500> his

favorites I really like the words of his
songs<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.940> it's<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.690> chill<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
songs and I like it's very chill like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.719 
songs and I like it's very chill like
with<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.410> acoustic<00:01:16.770> guitar<00:01:16.800> but<00:01:17.220> almost<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
with the acoustic guitar but almost to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.010 
with the acoustic guitar but almost to
me<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> reminds<00:01:18.240> me<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.509> Ramones<00:01:18.840> or

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
me it reminds me of like Ramones or

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.359 
me it reminds me of like Ramones or
something<00:01:19.410> because<00:01:19.649> he<00:01:19.830> has<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.070> kind<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
something because he has that kind of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.310 
something because he has that kind of
like<00:01:20.490> attitude<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.180> they're<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:21.930> simple

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
like attitude and they're really simple

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
like attitude and they're really simple
songs<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.920> they're<00:01:23.039> really<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.610> just

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
songs but they're really good I just

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
songs but they're really good I just
find<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.860> insane<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> way

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
find it really kind of insane the way

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.639 
find it really kind of insane the way
that<00:01:26.789> like<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.360> -<00:01:27.420> Nana<00:01:27.720> loves<00:01:27.990> music<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.560> be

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
that like they - Nana loves music to be

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.620 
that like they - Nana loves music to be
so<00:01:28.830> international<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:30.030> people<00:01:30.300> can<00:01:30.450> find

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
so international where people can find

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.969 
so international where people can find
it<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.050> just<00:01:31.080> connect<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it and they just connect with the way it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.560 
it and they just connect with the way it
sounds<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> doesn't<00:01:32.970> necessarily<00:01:33.450> have

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sounds and it doesn't necessarily have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
sounds and it doesn't necessarily have
to<00:01:33.600> represent<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.229> their<00:01:34.410> culture<00:01:34.830> you

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
to represent like their culture you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.380 
to represent like their culture you
think<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.880> find<00:01:36.060> something<00:01:36.330> of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
think it's to find something of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
think it's to find something of
themselves<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.050> so<00:01:37.740> we've<00:01:38.130> been<00:01:38.250> playing

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
seriously sometimes but a lot of times

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
seriously sometimes but a lot of times
it's<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> people<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.580> really

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's not actually the people that really

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670 
it's not actually the people that really
matter<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.299> it'll<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.900> like<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> sound<00:01:58.500> guy

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680

and<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.159> jerk<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.790> thinks<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and it's a jerk and thinks that you

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.899 
and it's a jerk and thinks that you
don't<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.540> anything<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.530> like

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
from home you know so or a lot of things

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.220 
from home you know so or a lot of things
going<00:05:44.250> into<00:05:44.400> that<00:05:44.580> but<00:05:44.850> that<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.720> pushed<00:05:46.020> us

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
going into that but that that pushed us

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.480 
going into that but that that pushed us
to<00:05:46.440> create<00:05:46.740> because<00:05:46.980> we<00:05:47.160> wanted<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.400> make

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.300 
to create because we wanted to make
something<00:05:47.820> for<00:05:47.970> ourselves<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.780> think<00:05:49.530> in<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.190> way

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
something for ourselves I think in a way

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
something for ourselves I think in a way
those<00:05:50.960> those<00:05:51.960> kind<00:05:52.200> of<00:05:52.260> downtrodden<00:05:53.330> areas

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
I don't know I think think it's really

it's<00:06:39.840> it's<00:06:40.170> cool<00:06:40.380> we<00:06:40.530> feel<00:06:40.680> really<00:06:40.770> fortunate

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
it's it's cool we feel really fortunate

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.150 
it's it's cool we feel really fortunate
that<00:06:41.280> we've<00:06:41.550> had<00:06:41.820> that<00:06:42.420> that<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:43.110> know<00:06:43.200> like

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
that we've had that that you know like

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.890 
that we've had that that you know like
television<00:06:44.580> exposure<00:06:44.820> of<00:06:45.060> Letterman<00:06:45.450> has

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
television exposure of Letterman has

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.630 
television exposure of Letterman has
really<00:06:46.110> like<00:06:46.230> helped<00:06:46.590> get<00:06:47.100> our<00:06:47.220> music<00:06:47.460> to<00:06:47.520> more

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
really like helped get our music to more

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.060 
really like helped get our music to more
people<00:06:47.820> and<00:06:48.240> is<00:06:49.170> this<00:06:49.260> kind<00:06:49.500> of<00:06:49.530> old<00:06:49.650> fashioned

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
people and is this kind of old fashioned

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.570 
people and is this kind of old fashioned
way<00:06:50.460> that<00:06:50.790> music<00:06:51.000> used<00:06:51.150> to<00:06:51.210> work<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.290> I<00:06:53.070> think

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
way that music used to work and I think

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.770 
way that music used to work and I think
we're<00:06:53.670> having<00:06:53.760> an<00:06:53.880> old-fashioned<00:06:54.360> band<00:06:54.510> and

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
we're having an old-fashioned band and

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.130 
we're having an old-fashioned band and
the<00:06:54.870> way<00:06:54.960> so<00:06:55.020> maybe<00:06:55.260> it<00:06:55.380> makes<00:06:55.500> sense<00:06:55.590> that
