00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.489
 the magnificat is quite clear 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 christmas piece it roughly said it 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 Yes, it's about the topic of maria 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.340
 experiences the healing world as the world 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.900
 will bring and and that is easy 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 This is what you are looking forward to 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.720
 expression brings and will be completely 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.519
 clearly audible and that became 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.930
 Premiered 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.430
 on the first christmas holiday 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.699
 17 23 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.790
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.479
 faced by these known 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.979
 bach magnificat is sven david sandström 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.350
 magnificat sven-david single of 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.180
 Swedish composer of 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.399
 contemporary composer who is very 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.830
 inspired by Bach 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.350
 He has this magnificat of Bach 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.420
 it has finally taken in the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.850
 The structure has left so 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.830
 orchestration has left the same 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 the soloist division left the same way 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.220
 but everything has now new again 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.560
 composed and but in a certain 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.720
 wise adapted and certain things 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.920
 taken over and created a piece 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 What you could say is a neo baroque 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.200
 So it's from the text 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:50.210
 Treatment of the phrasing is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.950
 It is very easily baroque 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.250
 but so the tone is very 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.250
 modern 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.550
 Furthermore, there are two motets 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.280
 the program 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.250
 one of johann sebastian bach singet 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 the mistress the famous motette 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.190
 We're in this program eight times 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 together with the ensemble resonance 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.310
 the colla party make the insula the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.550
 the choir parts will play along and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.850
 that the second motet is turn of 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.020
 sven david sandström does not fear you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.410
 This fashion is pure acapella and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.720
 also this neo-baroque sounded 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.730
 this neo-baroque sound language is the very one 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.440
 but based on Bach is quite 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 I am completely independent 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.520
 especially on the first cooperation 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.460
 on my first collaboration with the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.950
 ensemble resonance of this orchestra is 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.890
 yes for years successful 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.720
 musical partner of chorwerk ruhr 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.070
 and yes, I am especially pleased 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.500
 These concerts we then also in 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.850
 hamburg düsseldorf and public 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.770

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.770
