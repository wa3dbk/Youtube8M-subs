00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.970
 in this video we are going to see the 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.609
 construction of an octagon a polygon 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.530
 of eight side from the side notice the 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.460
 apdhe segment and the first thing we will do 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.950
 will draw the mean 3 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.779
 I previously went to the channel 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.990
 construction of an octagon by another 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.660
 method but good as long as there's 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.610
 several methods I'm going to go up so much 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.750
 one like another 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.890
 in case it is one or the other that they ask you or 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.250
 well in case you prefer one or the other 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.220
 we continue treating the average 3 as 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.829
 I always find it difficult to tune with 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.190
 compass when making center 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.190
 it's not very clear to me if I'm doing 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.010
 focuses exactly on the point that is is 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 something that would have happened to me with this 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.449
 software since I started I do not 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.329
 I'm so used to doing 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.539
 center in compass as to trace lines 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.549
 but with a ruler but hey the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.159
 I prefer this software to another one that are 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.040
 much more accurate but they are not 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.800
 visually they are not so clear 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.030
 or they do not show the paths so clear 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.230
 like this one that has already happened again for 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.800
 just the rule 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.220
 There, yes 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.210
 You see, we draw 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 the average 3 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 of the ap segment and now what we will do 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.070
 from point m and with measurement to one 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.960
 of the ends of the segment either or b 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.960
 we will draw an arc 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.340
 we're 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:56.430
 the arch that cuts the half-round in a 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.430
 point that we are going to call n 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.200
 the point we are going to call n and in it 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.930
 we will center 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.970
 with measure up to or even once 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.700
 measured to one end of the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 segment that they have given us as they have 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 given as a measure of the side 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.010
 as the measure 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.930
 we draw an arch that will give us the center 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 of the circumference where it will be 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.150
 inscribed our tone frame the arcs 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.060
 complete so you can have reference 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 from where take measure 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.760
 logically there was no need to mark the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.370
 full bow but it's good that what 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.250
 Mark me like that so you can see where 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.180
 it was the center where is where 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.180
 we take the measure 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.170
 and you have the reference with center no and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.020
 measure again more to the extremes 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.210
 of the cement we draw 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.900
 the circumference in the bed is 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.269
 described of the tones 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.629
 it would only be as in the layout of 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.840
 many of these polygons take the 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:20.599
 measure the bird segment and go 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.599
 transporting around the entire circumference 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.850
 As always we will treat from your baby 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.240
 to compensate for the possible error 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.240
 in the layout 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.970
 If we are precision it will not be necessary 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.290
 but 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.209
 it can happen 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.989
 that we have a small margin of error 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.989
 as far 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.629
 and that's why it's good to compensate both 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.629
 sides 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.270
 the software you ask me a lot in the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.650
 volunteers what software do I have 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.650
 post I think 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.730
 in the description of almost all 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.560
 videos at least of what I've heard 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:30.710
 more recently the geo software that 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.070
 free software there is a portable version 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.550
 already we commented once 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.960
 but I take this moment 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.960
 in the chest and drawing bow 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.780
 to increase once more 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.780
 and finally we will join the arcs 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:00.169
 on line 1 we will join the arcs 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:04.330
 with lines to get our octagon 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.330
 octagon the same 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.119
 with the bird tie measurement 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.560
 this is all I hope the video has been 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.560
 useful see you in the next video
