00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
then I will dado out the back here cut

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.580 
then I will dado out the back here cut
out<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.250> put<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> backboard<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the weight of this log on the bottom

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.830 
the weight of this log on the bottom
plus<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.840> circumference<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.220> plywood

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
plus the circumference of the plywood

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.039 
plus the circumference of the plywood
supported<00:01:27.840> down<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.500> three<00:01:28.950> places<00:01:30.020> will<00:01:31.020> be

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
supported down in three places will be

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
supported down in three places will be
enough<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.860> keep<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.610> tipping<00:01:33.090> over

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
enough to keep this from tipping over

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
enough to keep this from tipping over
naturally<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> plywood<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.369> screwed<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
naturally the plywood will be screwed in

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
naturally the plywood will be screwed in
here<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:37.079> there'll<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> stanchion

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
here and then there'll be a stanchion

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.999 
here and then there'll be a stanchion
down<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> plywood<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.840> stanchion<00:01:40.560> on

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
down to the plywood here a stanchion on

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
down to the plywood here a stanchion on
the<00:01:41.159> other<00:01:41.310> side<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.360> vertical<00:01:42.630> stanchion

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the other side and a vertical stanchion

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
the other side and a vertical stanchion
there<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:44.040> there's<00:01:44.310> no<00:01:44.490> tipping<00:01:45.000> towards

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
there because there's no tipping towards

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
there because there's no tipping towards
the<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> additional

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the back because of the additional

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.980 
the back because of the additional
weight<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.500> save<00:01:51.079> approximately

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
weight here so I will save approximately

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
weight here so I will save approximately
