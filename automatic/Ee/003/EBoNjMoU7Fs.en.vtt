00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.620

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:53.960
 a peaks and finally the shovel 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.470
 1 what we are going to do no matter what 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.530
 Eastern language except the desert 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.210
 because if they make this desert with 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.630
 the new update that is going to 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.550

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.110
 well I told you that the ones of these 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.450
 report 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 and materials we're just going to occupy something 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.510
 to make the structure and what's important 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 it will be the pumpkin the snow and with the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.980
 word 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.920
 we started by putting 4 one row and four 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 pictures of any material me in this 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.560
 moment is making him dedicate what 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 let's put four leaving one in 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.380
 half with a public and good here back 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.660
 we take care to do is put another one of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.080
 four rows here as I already had land 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.630
 as a door here I put trash 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.210
 and good here we are going to put a picture 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 to put the slab 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:02.479
 and there is the joke of this check for 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:06.290
 bridge is only a very closed game for 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.380
 that build our snow pollen and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.290
 they are going to see the secret but what 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.470
 we did is transform what we are going to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.730
 put another one up so you do not 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.830
 can move everything he is and then as 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.130
 they already knew the double wherever 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.970
 stop this one is going to leave your block of 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.459
 snow 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.360
 there is everything it says it is 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.150
 transforms snow and good the shovel already 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.819
 I said no matter what material it is that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.219
 we want to do is this 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.520
 we have to have the table next to us and 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:51.510
 fast a chest 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.310
 and then it's in buying between another court 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.910
 good what we are going to do is get closer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.180
 we as much as possible and in distress and half 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.860
 let's start digging one like 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.520
 we can see is that we are 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.650
 getting snowballs and we can 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.050
 do this all the time 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.980
 you want and right now we'll see 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.460
 because we occupy the chests and the table 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.930
 good champion how they knew about the balls 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.480
 of snow serve to also kill the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.200
 dragon of the leander and so is it not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.840
 they want to spend a lot of good arrows already 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.420
 We have a lot of snow, what we are going to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.270

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.990

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.000

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.090
