over<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.720> little<00:02:30.840> bit<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> prongs

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
over a little bit on one of the prongs

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.270 
over a little bit on one of the prongs
even<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.959> his<00:02:34.170> goggles<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.010> there's<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
even on his goggles so there's a little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.530 
even on his goggles so there's a little
bit<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.550> sign<00:02:35.850> here<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.420> guess<00:02:39.630> every

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
bit of a sign here so I guess every

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.870 
bit of a sign here so I guess every
every<00:02:42.540> figure<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.620> special<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.700> uh

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
every figure is kind of special just uh

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.580 
every figure is kind of special just uh
it<00:02:45.239> might<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.480> wetter<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.959> differently<00:02:48.170> yep

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
bit of cloth here kind of just to cover

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.210 
bit of cloth here kind of just to cover
it<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:08.930> kind<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.989> curious<00:03:10.560> why<00:03:10.799> they've

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it up kind of curious why they've

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.150 
it up kind of curious why they've
covered<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.060> up<00:03:12.350> for<00:03:13.350> what<00:03:13.500> reason<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:13.920> just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
covered that up for what reason is just

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.539 
covered that up for what reason is just
easier<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> hold<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> or<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:17.459> hide<00:03:17.670> something

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
easier to hold it or to hide something

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.850 
easier to hold it or to hide something
interesting<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.930> do<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.200> stuff<00:03:22.620> too

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
interesting I do like that stuff too

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.840 
interesting I do like that stuff too
it's<00:03:22.980> hollowed<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.739> can<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.700> wrap

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
it's hollowed out that you can can wrap

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's hollowed out that you can can wrap
something<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.330> there<00:03:27.480> too<00:03:30.650> let's<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.830> well

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
something in there too let's see well

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.330 
something in there too let's see well
there's<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.660> reticulation<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:34.530> kind<00:03:35.310> like

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
there's a reticulation it's kind like

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.080 
there's a reticulation it's kind like
your<00:03:35.549> standard<00:03:36.200> as<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.260> rating<00:03:37.650> figures

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
your standard as the rating figures

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.610 
your standard as the rating figures
similar<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.330> what<00:03:40.110> I've<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:40.500> did

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
similar to that what I've really did

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.470 
similar to that what I've really did
before<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.220> just<00:03:41.670> quickly<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.150> over<00:03:42.360> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
before but just quickly to go over it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.870 
before but just quickly to go over it
again<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.680> bolt<00:03:43.890> joint<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.459> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
again you have a bolt joint on the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.120 
again you have a bolt joint on the
heavier<00:03:45.180> they<00:03:45.810> are<00:03:45.870> swappable<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.980> can

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
heavier they are swappable you can

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.730 
heavier they are swappable you can
change<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.760> with<00:03:47.940> other<00:03:48.120> heads

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
change this with other heads

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.980 
change this with other heads
and<00:03:50.740> there<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.400> also<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.760> joint<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.780> base<00:03:52.960> of

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
and there is also a joint on the base of

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.690 
and there is also a joint on the base of
the<00:03:53.260> neck<00:03:53.440> which<00:03:53.890> allows<00:03:54.130> them<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.400> look<00:03:54.490> up

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
the neck which allows them to look up

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.060 
the neck which allows them to look up
and<00:03:55.000> down<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.910> now<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.070> shoulder

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
and down and now you have the shoulder

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.380 
and down and now you have the shoulder
here<00:04:00.340> which<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.390> believe<00:04:01.750> it's<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.710> peg<00:04:03.390> you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
here which is I believe it's a peg you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
swivel there and then you have the elbow

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.960 
swivel there and then you have the elbow
which<00:04:12.880> has<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.150> swivel<00:04:13.620> allows<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:14.970> rotate

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
which has a swivel allows you to rotate

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
and you have that hinge there else well

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.320 
and you have that hinge there else well
now<00:04:22.780> for<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.050> wrist<00:04:23.640> there<00:04:24.640> is<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.820> little<00:04:25.210> bit

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.870 
knee and it can bend all the way just
gotta<00:05:23.650> be<00:05:23.800> really<00:05:24.130> careful<00:05:24.340> when<00:05:24.760> you're

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
gotta be really careful when you're

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.410 
gotta be really careful when you're
bending<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.420> it's<00:05:25.690> really<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.740> stiff<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.700> you

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
bending this it's really a stiff and you

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.030 
bending this it's really a stiff and you
want<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.630> do<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.840> right<00:05:29.020> up<00:05:29.200> to<00:05:29.320> hold<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.920> at<00:05:30.010> the

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
want to do it right up to hold it at the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.800 
want to do it right up to hold it at the
base<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.640> joint

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
base of the joint

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.960 
base of the joint
and<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:34.340> have<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:34.520> swivel<00:05:34.760> on<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.570> ankle<00:05:36.050> and

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
and you have a swivel on the ankle and

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.270 
and you have a swivel on the ankle and
I'm<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.180> straightening<00:05:38.720> this<00:05:38.900> out<00:05:42.280> there's

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
I'm just straightening this out there's

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.920 
I'm just straightening this out there's
a<00:05:43.370> swivel<00:05:43.880> right<00:05:44.570> here<00:05:44.930> to<00:05:45.889> allow<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.280> do

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
a swivel right here to allow you to do

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:58.750 
a swivel right here to allow you to do
side<00:05:47.930> or<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:49.370> angle<00:05:49.669> his<00:05:49.790> leg<00:05:52.120> really<00:05:53.120> nice<00:05:57.760> and

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
side or to angle his leg really nice and

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.710 
side or to angle his leg really nice and
I<00:05:58.910> think<00:05:59.090> that's<00:05:59.240> about<00:05:59.360> it<00:05:59.600> for<00:05:59.750> articulation

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.390 

he<00:06:05.720> also<00:06:06.080> has<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.700> combat<00:06:07.700> stick<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:10.100> it<00:06:10.220> feels

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
he also has a combat stick and it feels

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.700 
he also has a combat stick and it feels
like<00:06:10.520> he's<00:06:10.640> a<00:06:10.669> cop

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.170 

so<00:06:16.280> this<00:06:17.000> stick<00:06:17.330> actually<00:06:17.630> it's<00:06:18.110> on<00:06:18.970> get<00:06:19.970> this

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
so this stick actually it's on get this

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.439 
so this stick actually it's on get this
thing<00:06:20.419> out<00:06:20.710> there<00:06:21.710> we<00:06:21.800> go<00:06:22.000> it's<00:06:23.000> on<00:06:23.120> a<00:06:23.150> clip

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
thing out there we go it's on a clip

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:29.260 
thing out there we go it's on a clip
that<00:06:23.780> I<00:06:24.710> just<00:06:24.949> go<00:06:25.250> goes<00:06:25.820> on<00:06:25.970> his<00:06:26.120> wrist<00:06:27.220> and<00:06:28.270> I

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
that I just go goes on his wrist and I

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.640 
that I just go goes on his wrist and I
guess<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.539> can<00:06:29.690> put<00:06:30.380> it<00:06:30.500> in<00:06:30.560> either<00:06:30.770> way<00:06:30.889> and<00:06:35.650> I

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
guess you can put it in either way and I

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.180 
guess you can put it in either way and I
just<00:06:37.210> pretty<00:06:38.210> much<00:06:38.270> haven't<00:06:38.870> pulled<00:06:39.050> it<00:06:39.259> it's

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
just pretty much haven't pulled it it's

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.110 
just pretty much haven't pulled it it's
combat<00:06:40.550> stick<00:06:42.400> okay<00:06:43.400> well<00:06:43.610> she<00:06:43.729> comes<00:06:43.850> with<00:06:44.090> a

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.850 
combat stick okay well she comes with a
shield<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.539> go<00:06:45.530> I'll<00:06:45.889> add<00:06:46.130> it<00:06:47.560> that's<00:06:48.560> probably

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
shield to go I'll add it that's probably

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.770
