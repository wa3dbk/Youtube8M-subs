00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.059 
I really enjoy working on a Mac but
sometimes<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.169> just<00:04:08.199> want<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.620> take<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.980> in

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
sometimes you just want to take it in

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.979 
sometimes you just want to take it in
smashing<00:04:09.519> into<00:04:09.669> pieces<00:04:10.090> because<00:04:10.419> of<00:04:10.569> Apple's

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
smashing into pieces because of Apple's

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.530 
smashing into pieces because of Apple's
stupid<00:04:11.470> decisions<00:04:12.040> on<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.609> hardware<00:04:13.000> inside

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
stupid decisions on the hardware inside

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.140 
stupid decisions on the hardware inside
these<00:04:13.780> things<00:04:14.190> some<00:04:15.190> people<00:04:15.220> also<00:04:15.609> say<00:04:15.970> that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
these things some people also say that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.849 
these things some people also say that
you<00:04:16.269> can't<00:04:16.539> even<00:04:16.720> get<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> virus<00:04:17.289> on<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.470> Mac<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
you can't even get a virus on a Mac I

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.979 
you can't even get a virus on a Mac I
actually<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.760> there<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.269> isn't<00:04:19.810> that

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
actually you can there just isn't that

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.770 
actually you can there just isn't that
many<00:04:20.560> viruses<00:04:20.919> out<00:04:21.159> there<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.669> Macs<00:04:21.909> so

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
many viruses out there for Macs so

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.890 
many viruses out there for Macs so
that's<00:04:23.020> why<00:04:23.169> Mac's<00:04:23.470> last<00:04:23.740> very<00:04:23.979> long<00:04:24.479> so<00:04:25.479> in

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
that's why Mac's last very long so in

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.810 
that's why Mac's last very long so in
conclusion<00:04:26.139> if<00:04:26.770> you're<00:04:27.099> just<00:04:27.370> an<00:04:27.520> average

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
conclusion if you're just an average

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.939 
conclusion if you're just an average
