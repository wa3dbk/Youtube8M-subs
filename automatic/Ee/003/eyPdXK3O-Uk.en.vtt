00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
real-life mp40 looks like and in the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.890 
real-life mp40 looks like and in the
game<00:00:23.040> so<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.940> world<00:00:24.150> war<00:00:24.330> version<00:00:24.630> kind<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
game so the world war version kind of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.930 
game so the world war version kind of
does<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.710> an<00:00:25.890> mp40<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940

got out of the box yesterday so these

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
got out of the box yesterday so these
two<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.039> very<00:00:44.460> similar<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:44.999> get<00:00:45.179> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
two are very very similar when we get to

the black ops 2 version that's sort of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
the black ops 2 version that's sort of
the<00:00:47.129> wild-card<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> outlie<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.569> is<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the wild-card the outlie this is the one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.000 
the wild-card the outlie this is the one
doesn't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.170> match<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.739> other<00:00:49.769> two

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

all right so the world war version sword
just<00:01:13.250> kick<00:01:13.580> straight<00:01:13.910> up<00:01:14.090> doesn't<00:01:14.330> really<00:01:14.480> go

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
just kick straight up doesn't really go

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.790

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
the exact same thing they just kick to

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.440 
the exact same thing they just kick to
the<00:01:22.070> right<00:01:22.160> every<00:01:22.400> now<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.670> then<00:01:22.820> both<00:01:23.300> of

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the right every now and then both of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.030 
the right every now and then both of
these<00:01:23.540> are<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:24.260> three<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.560> these<00:01:24.620> are<00:01:24.800> kind<00:01:24.890> of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
these are all three of these are kind of

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920 
these are all three of these are kind of
unrealistic<00:01:25.400> cuz<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> mp40<00:01:26.240> was<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.510> really

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
unrealistic cuz the mp40 was a really

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.390 
unrealistic cuz the mp40 was a really
good<00:01:27.080> gun<00:01:27.260> didn't<00:01:27.770> really<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.130> much

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
good gun didn't really have that much

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.520 
good gun didn't really have that much
recoil<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.210> had<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.690> say<00:01:29.869> they<00:01:30.020> all<00:01:30.140> sort<00:01:30.410> of

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
recoil so I had to say they all sort of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.870 
recoil so I had to say they all sort of
each<00:01:30.680> have<00:01:30.890> their<00:01:30.979> own<00:01:31.070> aspect<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
each have their own aspect of the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.640 
each have their own aspect of the
real-life<00:01:32.240> mp40<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.140> now<00:01:33.260> let's<00:01:33.380> move<00:01:33.470> on<00:01:33.619> to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
real-life mp40 so now let's move on to

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
real-life mp40 so now let's move on to
the<00:01:33.920> hipfire

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.460 

alright<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.570> world<00:01:43.750> war<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.110> before

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
alright so the world war is that before

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.230 
alright so the world war is that before
he<00:01:44.530> sort<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.830> focuses<00:01:45.250> its<00:01:45.430> hips<00:01:45.580> spray<00:01:45.790> all<00:01:46.090> in

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
he sort of focuses its hips spray all in

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.609 
he sort of focuses its hips spray all in
one<00:01:46.420> area<00:01:46.630> doesn't<00:01:46.900> really<00:01:47.140> kick<00:01:47.350> out<00:01:47.500> on

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
one area doesn't really kick out on

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.539 
one area doesn't really kick out on
having<00:01:47.710> too<00:01:47.920> many<00:01:47.979> outliers

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
having too many outliers

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.800 
having too many outliers
unlike<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.909> black<00:01:49.060> ops<00:01:49.240> one<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.509> black<00:01:49.600> ops

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
unlike the black ops one in black ops

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.749 
unlike the black ops one in black ops
two<00:01:49.960> birds<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.290> they<00:01:50.350> both<00:01:50.530> do<00:01:50.740> have<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.250> lot<00:01:51.729> of

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
two birds and they both do have a lot of

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.179 
two birds and they both do have a lot of
like<00:01:52.060> bullets<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:53.409> inside<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.070> main

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
like bullets going out inside the main

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.740 
like bullets going out inside the main
circle<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.670> does<00:01:54.850> focus<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:55.240> one<00:01:55.420> area<00:01:55.450> but

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
circle it does focus on one area but

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.060 
circle it does focus on one area but
every<00:01:56.439> now<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.649> then<00:01:56.710> you're<00:01:56.830> gonna<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.009> a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
every now and then you're gonna get a

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.499 
every now and then you're gonna get a
couple<00:01:57.250> stray<00:01:57.460> bullets<00:01:57.789> which<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.119> more

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
couple stray bullets which is more

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.060 
couple stray bullets which is more
realistic<00:01:58.990> now<00:01:59.560> let's<00:01:59.710> move<00:01:59.799> on<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.950> my

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070

the<00:02:52.060> afterburner<00:02:52.660> let's<00:02:52.900> start<00:02:53.050> off<00:02:53.110> with<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the afterburner let's start off with the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.540 
the afterburner let's start off with the
world<00:02:53.470> war<00:02:53.650> version<00:02:53.980> when<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.160> created<00:02:54.430> this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
world war version when you created this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
world war version when you created this
and<00:02:54.610> then<00:02:54.790> black<00:02:54.940> ops<00:02:55.150> 1<00:02:55.330> version<00:02:55.660> both<00:02:55.840> hold

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
and then black ops 1 version both hold

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.900 
and then black ops 1 version both hold
the<00:02:56.200> same<00:02:56.410> amount<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.680> ammo<00:02:56.980> same<00:02:57.520> in<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.730> clip

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
the same amount of ammo same in the clip

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.130 
the same amount of ammo same in the clip
pants<00:02:58.240> same<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.600> side<00:02:58.810> when<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.050> upgrade

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
pants same in the side when you upgrade

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.870

when<00:03:04.600> we<00:03:04.660> up<00:03:04.780> today<00:03:05.020> chrome<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.830> date

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
when we up today chrome is out of date

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.560 
when we up today chrome is out of date
so<00:03:06.250> now<00:03:06.550> let's<00:03:06.670> move<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.030> black<00:03:07.180> ops<00:03:07.390> 1

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
so now let's move on to the black ops 1

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.640 
so now let's move on to the black ops 1
version<00:03:07.810> we<00:03:07.900> upgrade<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> black<00:03:08.320> ops<00:03:08.500> 1

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
version we upgrade the black ops 1

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.780 
version we upgrade the black ops 1
version<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.980> course<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.310> holds<00:03:09.520> the<00:03:09.580> same

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
version of course it holds the same

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.400 
version of course it holds the same
amount<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.090> ammo<00:03:10.210> as<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.480> world<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.750> war<00:03:10.900> but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
amount of ammo as the world of war but

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.080 
amount of ammo as the world of war but
it<00:03:11.470> has<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> really<00:03:12.430> cool-looking

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
it has a really cool-looking

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.640 
it has a really cool-looking
pack-a-punch<00:03:13.540> camo<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.290> got<00:03:14.410> stronger

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
pack-a-punch camo and it got stronger

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.530 
pack-a-punch camo and it got stronger
now<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.950> afterburn<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.000> all<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.210> other<00:03:16.330> guns

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
now the afterburn and all the other guns

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.390 
now the afterburn and all the other guns
get<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> lot<00:03:16.870> stronger<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.560> zombies<00:03:18.220> games

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
get a lot stronger as the zombies games

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.560 
get a lot stronger as the zombies games
progressed<00:03:18.760> but<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:18.970> one's<00:03:19.150> personally<00:03:19.480> my

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
progressed but this one's personally my

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.120 
progressed but this one's personally my
favorite<00:03:19.870> discuss<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.200> how<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.380> feels<00:03:20.620> it's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
favorite discuss of how it feels it's

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.110 
favorite discuss of how it feels it's
all<00:03:21.250> really<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.610> which<00:03:21.790> gun<00:03:21.970> you're

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
all really about which gun you're

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.340 
all really about which gun you're
comfortable<00:03:22.420> with<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> feel

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
comfortable with and this one I feel

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.630 
comfortable with and this one I feel
most<00:03:23.560> comfortable<00:03:23.740> with<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.220> feel<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.490> it's

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
most comfortable with I feel like it's

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.700 
most comfortable with I feel like it's
just<00:03:24.730> overall<00:03:25.210> in<00:03:25.390> my<00:03:25.510> opinion<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> best<00:03:26.050> now

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
just overall in my opinion the best now

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.170 
just overall in my opinion the best now
the<00:03:26.770> black<00:03:26.950> ops<00:03:27.160> 2<00:03:27.310> version<00:03:27.610> who<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.790> probably

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the black ops 2 version who is probably

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.090 
the black ops 2 version who is probably
in<00:03:28.390> theory<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.930> realistically<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.920> best

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
in theory and realistically the best

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.350 
in theory and realistically the best
because<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.430> holds<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.640> most<00:03:30.820> ammo<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.270> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
because it holds the most ammo it's the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.270 
because it holds the most ammo it's the
strongest<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.080> back<00:03:32.620> punch<00:03:32.830> game<00:03:33.010> was<00:03:33.130> pretty

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
strongest and back punch game was pretty

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.770 
strongest and back punch game was pretty
cool<00:03:33.430> but<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:34.210> don't<00:03:34.330> like<00:03:34.510> how<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.750> feels

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
cool but I just don't like how it feels

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.150 
cool but I just don't like how it feels
I<00:03:35.020> don't<00:03:35.140> like<00:03:35.230> how<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.440> sounds<00:03:35.860> not<00:03:35.950> really

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
I don't like how it sounds not really

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.710 
I don't like how it sounds not really
fan<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.400> how<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.550> shoots<00:03:36.730> my<00:03:37.330> opinion<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
fan of how it shoots my opinion the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.540 
fan of how it shoots my opinion the
black<00:03:37.900> ops<00:03:38.080> 1<00:03:38.260> version<00:03:38.440> was<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.680> best<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.160> in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
black ops 1 version was the best and in

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.830 
black ops 1 version was the best and in
the<00:03:39.640> world<00:03:39.820> war<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.390> black<00:03:40.600> ops<00:03:40.780> 2

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the world war and the black ops 2

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.360 
the world war and the black ops 2
version<00:03:41.200> are<00:03:41.320> tied<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:41.890> let's<00:03:42.010> get<00:03:42.070> into

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
version are tied so now let's get into

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:51.929 
version are tied so now let's get into
the<00:03:42.520> recoils<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.270> this<00:03:43.450> gun

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.039 

all<00:03:52.939> right<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.180> award<00:03:53.360> award<00:03:53.599> version<00:03:53.930> of

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
all right the award award version of

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:54.699 
all right the award award version of
this<00:03:54.200> Rico

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
this Rico

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.690 
this Rico
sort<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:54.950> that's<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.159> same<00:03:55.340> thing<00:03:55.489> as<00:03:55.579> the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
sort of that's the same thing as the

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.039 
sort of that's the same thing as the
unupgraded<00:03:55.909> version<00:03:56.450> just<00:03:56.540> kicked<00:03:56.780> straight

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
unupgraded version just kicked straight

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.780 
unupgraded version just kicked straight
up<00:03:57.200> Isis<00:03:57.470> has<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> lot<00:03:57.920> bigger<00:03:58.099> clip<00:03:58.340> you're

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
up Isis has a lot bigger clip you're

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.429 
up Isis has a lot bigger clip you're
gonna<00:03:58.909> be<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.150> hard<00:03:59.360> farther<00:03:59.930> up<00:04:00.110> and<00:04:00.349> it's

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
gonna be going hard farther up and it's

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.720 
gonna be going hard farther up and it's
gonna<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.620> harder<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:00.890> control<00:04:01.129> then<00:04:01.640> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
gonna be harder to control then the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.250 
gonna be harder to control then the
black<00:04:01.879> ops<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.269> version<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:02.989> does<00:04:03.170> the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
black ops one version so it does the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.080 
black ops one version so it does the
same<00:04:03.409> thing<00:04:03.470> as<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.459> UH<00:04:04.489> no<00:04:04.610> creative<00:04:04.879> version

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
same thing as the UH no creative version

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.429 
same thing as the UH no creative version
except<00:04:05.299> for<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.450> opposite<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.870> kicks<00:04:06.140> off<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
except for the opposite it kicks off to

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.319 
except for the opposite it kicks off to
the<00:04:06.530> left<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.010> not<00:04:07.159> to<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> right<00:04:07.640> kicks<00:04:08.209> off

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
the left and not to the right kicks off

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.550 
the left and not to the right kicks off
to<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.510> left<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.900> up<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.110> little<00:04:09.230> bit<00:04:09.349> but<00:04:09.470> this

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
to the left and up a little bit but this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.319 
to the left and up a little bit but this
one's<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.799> lot<00:04:09.890> easier<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> control<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:11.120> black

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
one's a lot easier to control the black

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.119 
one's a lot easier to control the black
ops<00:04:11.510> 2<00:04:11.599> version<00:04:12.019> kicks<00:04:12.200> off<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.620> left<00:04:12.860> and

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
ops 2 version kicks off to the left and

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.680 
ops 2 version kicks off to the left and
down<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:13.670> these<00:04:13.760> all<00:04:13.970> three<00:04:14.180> have<00:04:14.299> very

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
down so these all three have very

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.819 
down so these all three have very
different<00:04:14.870> recoils<00:04:15.409> when<00:04:15.530> you're<00:04:15.650> a

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
different recoils when you're a

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.379 
different recoils when you're a
de-essing<00:04:16.280> but<00:04:16.579> now<00:04:16.699> let's<00:04:16.850> get<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
de-essing but now let's get on to the

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:26.670 
de-essing but now let's get on to the
hip<00:04:17.600> fire

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.990 

all<00:04:27.680> right<00:04:27.800> all<00:04:27.949> three<00:04:28.159> sort<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.520> had<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.729> same

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
all right all three sort of had the same

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.300 
all right all three sort of had the same
recoil<00:04:29.539> as<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.990> first<00:04:30.259> one<00:04:30.469> the<00:04:30.680> hipfire<00:04:31.039> gets

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
recoil as the first one the hipfire gets

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.619 
recoil as the first one the hipfire gets
worse<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:31.669> worse<00:04:31.729> as<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.150> go<00:04:32.240> along<00:04:32.330> you've

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
worse and worse as you go along you've

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.300 
worse and worse as you go along you've
seen<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.900> world<00:04:32.990> war<00:04:33.169> version<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:33.590> mp40<00:04:34.189> is

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
seen the world war version this mp40 is

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.219 
seen the world war version this mp40 is
not<00:04:34.490> moving<00:04:34.849> at<00:04:35.000> all<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.629> can<00:04:35.780> hit<00:04:35.840> fire<00:04:36.050> for

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
not moving at all you can hit fire for

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.110 
not moving at all you can hit fire for
days<00:04:36.409> and<00:04:36.590> stay<00:04:36.919> in<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.069> same<00:04:37.099> spot<00:04:37.370> linking

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
days and stay in the same spot linking

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.399 
days and stay in the same spot linking
onto<00:04:38.300> black<00:04:38.449> ops<00:04:38.659> 1<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.960> can<00:04:39.050> see<00:04:39.139> it's<00:04:39.259> sort

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
onto black ops 1 you can see it's sort

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.589 
onto black ops 1 you can see it's sort
of<00:04:39.530> swept<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:39.979> sort<00:04:40.669> of<00:04:40.759> sway<00:04:41.000> in<00:04:41.180> every<00:04:41.479> now

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
of swept this sort of sway in every now

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.999 
of swept this sort of sway in every now
and<00:04:41.780> then<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.379> know<00:04:42.469> we're<00:04:42.590> getting<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.800> couple

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
and then you know we're getting a couple

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.439 
and then you know we're getting a couple
of<00:04:43.069> bullets<00:04:43.310> going<00:04:43.460> here<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:43.819> there<00:04:43.939> when<00:04:44.389> we

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
of bullets going here and there when we

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.610 
of bullets going here and there when we
get<00:04:44.539> on<00:04:44.659> the<00:04:44.750> black<00:04:44.900> ops<00:04:45.080> 2<00:04:45.229> version<00:04:45.469> you<00:04:45.530> can

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
get on the black ops 2 version you can

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.050 
get on the black ops 2 version you can
see<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.830> gun<00:04:46.009> sort<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.370> recoil<00:04:46.729> and<00:04:46.819> all<00:04:46.909> up

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
see this gun sort of recoil and all up

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.520 
see this gun sort of recoil and all up
I'm<00:04:47.180> not<00:04:47.270> moving<00:04:47.539> the<00:04:47.599> stick<00:04:47.810> at<00:04:47.930> all<00:04:48.050> it's

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
I'm not moving the stick at all it's

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.140 
I'm not moving the stick at all it's
just<00:04:48.740> going<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:49.099> on<00:04:49.280> its<00:04:49.460> own<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:49.849> recoil

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
just going up on its own so the recoil

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.850 
just going up on its own so the recoil
gets<00:04:50.300> worse<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.659> worse<00:04:50.810> as<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.560> games<00:04:51.710> go

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
gets worse and worse as the games go

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.809 
gets worse and worse as the games go
along<00:04:52.009> which<00:04:52.129> makes<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.430> little<00:04:52.520> bit<00:04:52.669> more

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
along which makes it a little bit more

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.339 
along which makes it a little bit more
realistic<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.599> now<00:04:53.719> it's<00:04:53.810> one<00:04:54.020> of<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.169> best

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
realistic so now it's one of the best

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.080 
realistic so now it's one of the best
part<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> firing<00:04:55.099> rate<00:04:55.280> which<00:04:55.699> one<00:04:55.879> you<00:04:55.969> guys

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
part the firing rate which one you guys

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.159 
part the firing rate which one you guys
think<00:04:56.240> has<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.419> best<00:04:56.539> firing<00:04:56.870> rate<00:04:56.990> they<00:04:57.080> all

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
think has the best firing rate they all

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.540 
think has the best firing rate they all
three<00:04:57.409> have<00:04:57.560> different<00:04:57.710> firing<00:04:58.219> rates<00:04:58.370> by

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
three have different firing rates by

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.219 
three have different firing rates by
about<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> frame<00:04:59.479> or<00:04:59.629> two<00:04:59.659> it's<00:04:59.810> could<00:04:59.930> be<00:04:59.960> this

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
about a frame or two it's could be this

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.269 
about a frame or two it's could be this
could<00:05:00.439> have<00:05:00.529> been<00:05:00.560> human<00:05:00.889> error<00:05:01.039> they<00:05:01.129> could

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
could have been human error they could

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.709 
could have been human error they could
all<00:05:01.370> three<00:05:01.520> had<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.699> same<00:05:01.879> firing<00:05:02.180> rate<00:05:02.330> but<00:05:02.509> I

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
all three had the same firing rate but I

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.969 
all three had the same firing rate but I
did<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.139> best<00:05:03.259> I<00:05:03.379> could<00:05:03.409> to<00:05:03.590> make<00:05:03.740> sure<00:05:03.800> they

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
did the best I could to make sure they

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.529 
did the best I could to make sure they
start<00:05:04.219> at<00:05:04.279> the<00:05:04.310> same<00:05:04.400> time<00:05:04.699> and<00:05:04.969> at<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.419> same

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
start at the same time and at the same

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.629 
start at the same time and at the same
time<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:06.080> put<00:05:06.710> your<00:05:06.919> thoughts<00:05:07.279> in<00:05:07.490> your<00:05:07.520> head

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
time so put your thoughts in your head

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.980 
time so put your thoughts in your head
right<00:05:07.879> now<00:05:07.909> and<00:05:08.300> we'll<00:05:08.479> talk<00:05:08.659> about<00:05:08.750> what's

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
right now and we'll talk about what's

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:22.510 
right now and we'll talk about what's
over

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.650 

alright<00:05:23.520> looks<00:05:23.669> like<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.910> black<00:05:24.090> ops<00:05:24.300> 2<00:05:24.419> who

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
alright looks like the black ops 2 who

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.360 
alright looks like the black ops 2 who
has<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.990> fastest<00:05:25.349> fire<00:05:25.500> rate<00:05:25.560> these<00:05:25.889> dudes<00:05:26.129> I

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
has the fastest fire rate these dudes I

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.439 
has the fastest fire rate these dudes I
did<00:05:26.550> try<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:26.729> start<00:05:26.970> these<00:05:27.030> all<00:05:27.180> at<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.300> same

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
did try to start these all at the same

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.119 
did try to start these all at the same
time<00:05:27.509> so<00:05:28.020> they<00:05:28.259> might<00:05:28.409> be<00:05:28.530> off<00:05:28.650> like<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:28.949> frame

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:29.129 
time so they might be off like a frame

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.920 
time so they might be off like a frame
or<00:05:29.280> two<00:05:29.310> but<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.090> this<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.330> could<00:05:30.449> easily<00:05:30.599> see

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
or two but in this you could easily see

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.570 
or two but in this you could easily see
that<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.229> black<00:05:31.409> ops<00:05:31.620> 2<00:05:31.800> finished<00:05:32.250> well

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
that the black ops 2 finished well

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.520 
that the black ops 2 finished well
before<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.000> world<00:05:33.180> war<00:05:33.300> version<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:34.169> almost

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
before the world war version and almost

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.839 
before the world war version and almost
the<00:05:34.590> same<00:05:34.770> time<00:05:34.979> as<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.190> black<00:05:35.340> ops<00:05:35.520> 1<00:05:35.699> version

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
the same time as the black ops 1 version

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.129 
the same time as the black ops 1 version
so<00:05:36.030> it's<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.270> they<00:05:36.360> increase<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.810> speed<00:05:36.990> of

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
so it's like they increase the speed of

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.860 
so it's like they increase the speed of
the<00:05:37.199> mp40<00:05:37.650> as<00:05:37.889> zombies<00:05:38.520> went<00:05:38.699> along<00:05:38.879> so<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.389> mean

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
the mp40 as zombies went along so I mean

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.749 
the mp40 as zombies went along so I mean
this<00:05:40.199> video<00:05:40.470> just<00:05:40.680> it<00:05:40.979> seems<00:05:41.310> like<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.580> black

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
this video just it seems like the black

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.129 
this video just it seems like the black
ops<00:05:41.940> 2<00:05:42.150> version<00:05:42.449> would<00:05:42.539> probably<00:05:42.810> be<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.990> best

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
ops 2 version would probably be the best

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.899 
ops 2 version would probably be the best
that<00:05:43.319> has<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.560> most<00:05:43.740> damage<00:05:44.129> has<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.759> biggest

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
that has the most damage has the biggest

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.790 
that has the most damage has the biggest
clip<00:05:45.270> as<00:05:45.509> a<00:05:45.539> fastest<00:05:45.930> firing<00:05:46.259> rate<00:05:46.379> but<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.650> me

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
clip as a fastest firing rate but to me

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.860 
clip as a fastest firing rate but to me
the<00:05:47.280> black<00:05:47.520> ops<00:05:47.729> 1<00:05:47.879> version<00:05:48.090> will<00:05:48.479> be<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:48.659> best

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
the black ops 1 version will be the best

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.240 
the black ops 1 version will be the best
because<00:05:49.080> it's<00:05:49.409> just<00:05:49.530> it's<00:05:49.770> easier<00:05:50.009> for<00:05:50.159> me<00:05:50.220> to

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
because it's just it's easier for me to

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.800 
because it's just it's easier for me to
use<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.759> feel<00:05:50.940> more<00:05:51.090> comfortable<00:05:51.270> with<00:05:51.599> it

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
use I feel more comfortable with it

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.570 
use I feel more comfortable with it
unlike<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.500> other<00:05:52.620> ones<00:05:52.710> just<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.130> feeling

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
unlike the other ones just the feeling

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.620 
unlike the other ones just the feeling
feels<00:05:53.759> a<00:05:53.849> lot<00:05:53.970> better<00:05:54.120> with<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:54.360> black<00:05:54.479> out

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
feels a lot better with a black out

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.580 
feels a lot better with a black out
smelling<00:05:54.780> version<00:05:55.139> but<00:05:55.229> that's<00:05:55.380> just

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
smelling version but that's just
