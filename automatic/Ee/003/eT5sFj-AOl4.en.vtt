00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.200
 all right 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.060
 [Music] 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.380
 of the new generation of consoles has 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.420
 and his own ration of zombies the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.189
 funny saga dead rising arrives at xbox 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.440
 one with his biggest adventure and 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.000
 ambitious more walkers than ever in 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.489
 screen for a world that also 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.140
 shoots its size and its possibilities a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.780
 new holocaust of undead 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.290
 loaded with surprises prepared for the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290
 survival 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.550
 in racing 3 we are nick a mechanic 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
 that is immersed in the apocalypse in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.750
 the city of the lost when presented 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.489
 everything so abruptly in the first 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.739
 minutes the situation will leave us so 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.780
 perplexed as to him but little by little the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.220
 history is shelled and allows us 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 know the ins and outs about 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.970
 situation that we are living by hands 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.960
 of different survivors with whom 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.960
 we will be taking 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.590
 to most of them we find them and 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.240
 we give them a hand some even 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.490
 will accompany us to help us with 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.200
 missions that we carry out however 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 They could not miss the appointment 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 psychopaths those human enemies 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 unbalanced that have characterized 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
 the saga and they come back here to act 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.060
 of presence offering us some of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.130
 the best moments of the campaign 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 so the zombies are not our only 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.030
 adversary although yes the most abundant 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 the city is open for the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 let's explore with total freedom and so much 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.880
 the streets as the buildings are 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.439
 plagued with undead is not a 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.600
 obligation to do away with them since 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.549
 they just swarm around but it's 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.289
 so funny to massacre them and there are so many 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.700
 different ways of doing it that is going to 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.710
 cost a lot not to do usually 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.689
 stop on our way to try 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 how we destroy them with those little things that 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.950
 we have found 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.259
 what we do have to do yes or yes is 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.850
 accomplish missions in them almost always 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.170
 we have to help someone find 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.060
 something to give us back the favor 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.680
 we have to say that they are not so 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.360
 fun like exploring the world to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.310
 our rhythm and look for things that we 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.110
 help survival but having 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.970
 note that the time of the campaign is 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.000
 limited our attention has to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.190
 divide between one thing and another 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 so important will be then to dedicate ourselves 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.210
 to the main objectives as 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.040
 make us a good arsenal any 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.780
 thing is worth to hit or shoot at 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 our enemies and some of the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.710
 funniest moments come up 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.780
 precisely the most absurd objects 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.610
 yes you have to be careful because 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.800
 both vehicles and weapons are 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.110
 they wear out and they can leave us lying on 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.610
 the worst moment besides health is not 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.140
 regenerates so we have to look 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.930
 also accoutrements with which 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.430
 restore it more of course because 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.800
 We can also manufacture our 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 own accessories for this we must give 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.730
 with planes and then compose the objects 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.410
 with the pieces that are needed 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.000
 all this to make us with accessories 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.830
 that will come very well in the parties 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.090
 more challenging and they are often 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.670
 really funny 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.130
 [Music] 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.470
 yes, the game is easier than 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.660
 previous the series was well known for 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.150
 its brutal difficulty and this time 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.800
 the thing has softened clear that the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.660
 lovers of suffering will have the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.030
 possibility of radicalizing it with the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.560
 nightmare mode here the experience of 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.780
 complete it on time and get 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.360
 all the unlockables becomes 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.400
 a maximum challenge there is also a cooperative 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 through the internet to get together with 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.690
 a friend so we can carry out the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 same pranks that alone alone 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.050
 that with the extra of madness and fun of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.420
 do it accompanied 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.730
 in the visuals of dries interest has been a 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 videogame very discussed true not 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.870
 reaches the resolution of 1080p and that in 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.490
 some very specific moments can 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.440
 suffer in the rate of images by 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.940
 second but you have to be fair and leave 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.330
 clear that the program presents a 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.610
 Super aspect although not shocking 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.080
 the city is very well done and 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.000
 the fact that there is 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.650
 so many places to visit and finally 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.990
 we can enter most of the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.000
 buildings plus the amount of zombies 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.100
 it's surprisingly high and all 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.260
 They have mutilations very careful and 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.480
 look very different from each other the 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.090
 kinematics impress with their quality and 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.210
 the set presents an illumination 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.160
 extraordinary in terms of sound 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.230
 launch arrives translated and folded to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.299
 our language the music and the effects 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.650
 they are also at a great height composing 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.750
 thus production values 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.610
 frankly good from dries interest not 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.590
 is the best installment of the saga but it is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.900
 a good start for the ip in the new 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.120
 generation is a video game that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.190
 although he could have given more of himself is very 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.990
 fun and one that will not entertain 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.480
 especially if we dedicate ourselves to the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.560
 scan or do the thug without a doubt 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 its best parts
