00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 minecraft for the other small 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.920
 I was waiting in grade 1.7 point 10 but 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 what this mode is about because this light 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 charge six enemies 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.750
 hostile in minecraft that are mods 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.929
 let's say dangerous in quotes because 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.759
 are very very difficult when it comes to 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.439
 kill them but well also roy weapons 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.949
 we have here the little mini kinder that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.980
 look at that abode in 6 this is a cute 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 my mother that I eat it I eat it 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.090
 if I'm going to kill him because I imagine that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.460
 this should release a pearl of nerva for 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 Please do not transport it for you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.520
 handles another first this should not loose 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 how it was editing earlier 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 pearls to sell more and another little thing 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.240

 so it does not loose peels 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.630
 I do not know if this varies in the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 odds but good and you owe us 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.530
 I wanted to say too I'm not going to let go 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.690
 this little fragment that is between 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.390
 man that in turn with this creation is 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.760
 you can use or create a pearl 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.729
 ender man here you see a little cut or 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.170
 of tnt but this the safest 7 for 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.970
 later how did the video that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.890
 It's nothing out of this world but good 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.310
 trains is a poop I tell you so 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.160
 how to get out for the next one that is a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 wants to see with confusion that I imagine 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.000
 that if the probable explodes with a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.119
 lighter 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.500
 this does not have we will not give to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.300
 explode to see what you let go of us or 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.650
 explode to see 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.160
 us to teleported I think and it gives us 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.620
 Level 2 nausea is a little 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.810
 great to this this mode but the best 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.330
 that has given me the grace I have to 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 look here I have a clipper and now 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.780
 I'm going to put a mini cooper and not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.240
 like clippers to this sick nesta 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.860
 that very cool multi also a little thing 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.140
 I wanted to tell you that I want to be 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.360
 wrong this let's say kill first 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.100
 it's because they did not materialize 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.980
 because I'm going to kill him first go 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.830
 we go first then because this cri but 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.260
 I was not going to release another small fragment 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 It's good enough 2 this is what you need 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.010
 this shot takes a shot that should let us go 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 this little fragment is called 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.660
 confusion power that turn when 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.330
 we will be able to raise different 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.970
 tenentes does not add many have that what 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.440
 they add three but they do not make the other world 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.570
 It is as stated above 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.380
 that is, and by the others 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.710
 they are bots 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.860
 here we have the mode let's say warrior 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.510
 there are two classes are I'm wrong fasting 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.900
 good also the other 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.959
 to 1 here we have the other one here we have 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.930
 two classes that have one archer 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.409
 and we have here another warrior that are 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.620
 very difficult to kill eye these are very 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.560
 difficult and most difficult for me I think 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.290
 who have a special ability or a 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.879
 ability to kill you awesome and 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.739
 Besides this if I'm not mistaken we 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.069
 I must release delighted things I think 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.329
 let's see we take off a bone eye this from 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.750
 tested was on camera and we forget about 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.459
 drop let's say an armor like I think 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.190
 I imagine that if I do not now 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.090
 loose anything is worth we want the clip but 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.470
 that after the first shot it takes takes but 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.609
 this was not knowing where he is please 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.079
 I do not want to lose 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.940
 well it was the same here we continue with 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.889
 the next mother of mine is that sorry 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.650
 before starting with this mode this mod 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.329
 or let's say these enemies there is a 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.269
 small problem that you release in your 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.980
 armor and yet another one that you 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.560
 release in your armor a little 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.540
 Haunted is worth with that country 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.849
 Well, here we have the following 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.569
 do this peaceful first peaceful 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.510
 Peacefully I'll put 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.159
 and we're going to invoke the next mod is 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.439
 I wanted to teach it little by little 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.450
 here we have this bubble with 30 life 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.989
 and the best always has a companion 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.989
 that is your beloved guateque and ya what 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.849
 I say since this mode for me or this 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.560
 hostile enemy to me is the most 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.110
 dangerous of all is worth a 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.630
 diamond armor you notice now 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.340
 this around here and see how he looks at me like 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.389
 well to attack and look at the taking the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.789
 cat in the cat to the pituto everything is fine 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.250
 very ask the event in creative because 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.889
 will you kill me you will you kill you 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.110
 is I think it was what we were with 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.479
 throwing gives us take care for five 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.950
 seconds so we killed her and like 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.420
 I was saying 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.310
 in this way for me it is the most difficult 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.350
 of all of all by difference 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.960
 here we have this that should let us go 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.460
 a healing portion that is very 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.990
 well if you do not want to charge the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.870
 widder who has pulled us from his 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.120
 enchanted techniques but not only that 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.700
 we have others over here we have the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.500
 I only guess what to see 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.169
 if you want to and forgiveness is alone or does 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.900
 It is missing it worth not think no no no no 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.949
 opens a way to grow the cat unless 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.779
 that the gentleman is 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.599
 The last one is the one 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.599
 second this for me is unique 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.599
 paid out 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:33.270
 the wolf because it is raining to mine 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.999
 my mother now here we have the last 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.689
 the vete that for me is also very 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.689
 Hard to kill 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.999
 it's impressively asshole asshole 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.409
 so we see the creative again and come 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.089
 here how many times have your party 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.800
 plugged in 8 farmar here but here 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.839
 I'm creative, I do not care, I'm going to 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.089
 kill by my nose was here it takes tomato 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.390
 to live or stalker does not pass na no 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.450
 pass na vale 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.650
 and good of all is what this 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.630
 system and apart from that I'm going to teach 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.920
 right now the teles that let go of us and 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.350
 let's say this mod 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.660
 as well as start here and here 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.640
 I think they release these three are very 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.070
 faces I already say this and here we have the 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.840
 first to see we have the confusion 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.080
 singer good in english kind as ya 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.390
 you know if you want to go back to four of 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.110
 sand or four of reddish sand as you see 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:25.030
 here and this confusion power that this does not 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.100
 I should let go, let's say the sender van 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.200
 in this way it is worth not forgive the scripts 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.510
 in this way it is worth comos to look at this 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.590
 over here I'm going to give you here to put it on 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:38.590
 here to the sheep lady and I'm going to give 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.300
 see what happens to see worth we give it to what 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:45.500
 what happens to see and see 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.319
 so, nothing honestly happens to 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.669
 see me to see what happens here because I do not 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.669
 shone nothing interesting 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:59.170
 I think it makes us nauseous 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.720
 poop in my opinion by the following this one 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.980
 is the one of elche that I imagine for the 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.830
 name of glasses will not have to 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.720
 teleport to see your skull is done 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.210
 with four fragments of ender man that 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.310
 they release us the two mini ndr plus four 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.620
 of reddish sand or sand and once 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.900
 will come back we are going to try this to see 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.950
 I do not know if I'll have to go to see the 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.680
 better knows the sheep 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.080
 Okay, so you have not transported 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.180
 having enough kaka but at the same time 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.520
 it can be quite interesting we are going to 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.620
 go for the last one with the conclusion 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.050
 my mother zeiger in English specials already 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.890
 not English and their earrings are not t 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.320
 sorry 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:42.440
 ok this is done with three fragments of 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.260
 enter fragment forgiveness one of gunpowder ua 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.760
 three of confusion power and two of sand 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.710
 good the expenses are very parents either 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.480
 they're nothing special and you're going to see 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.930
 is because I imagine that these two in 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.449
 one to see 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.970
 go then it does not transport you and also you 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:08.580
 nausea level 2 but good I think 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:12.620
 that I am going to treat the video and our 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.620
 next video goodbye 20 no bye goodbye
