to hang a bit I can just show you the

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.089 
to hang a bit I can just show you the
pattern<00:00:13.419> I'll<00:00:13.660> show<00:00:13.870> you<00:00:13.959> the<00:00:14.049> cords<00:00:14.469> or<00:00:14.620> play

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
pattern I'll show you the cords or play

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.010 
pattern I'll show you the cords or play
it<00:00:15.129> fly<00:00:15.400> so<00:00:15.459> I'll<00:00:15.639> play<00:00:15.849> it<00:00:15.879> slow<00:00:16.180> and<00:00:16.450> there

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
it fly so I'll play it slow and there

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.380 
it fly so I'll play it slow and there
you<00:00:17.140> go<00:00:17.200> you<00:00:17.560> can<00:00:17.950> go<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.280> then<00:00:18.430> actually<00:00:18.820> play

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
you go you can go and then actually play

you go you can go and then actually play
it<00:00:19.449> on<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.599> guitar<00:00:19.689> which<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.260> what<00:00:20.439> it's<00:00:20.560> all

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
it on the guitar which is what it's all

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.390 
it on the guitar which is what it's all
about<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:22.029> today's<00:00:22.449> pattern<00:00:22.929> and<00:00:23.310> once<00:00:24.310> again

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
about so today's pattern and once again

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.339 
about so today's pattern and once again
it's<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:24.759> combination<00:00:25.000> of<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.869> first<00:00:26.170> two

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
it's a combination of the first two

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.169 
it's a combination of the first two
patterns<00:00:26.589> we've<00:00:26.890> looked<00:00:27.070> at<00:00:27.250> it's<00:00:27.849> almost

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
patterns we've looked at it's almost

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.109 
patterns we've looked at it's almost
like<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.949> reversed<00:00:29.949> version<00:00:30.580> of<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:30.910> last

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
like a reversed version of the last

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.640 
like a reversed version of the last
pattern<00:00:31.359> not<00:00:31.750> one<00:00:31.839> hundred<00:00:31.900> percent<00:00:32.110> reversed

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
pattern not one hundred percent reversed

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.190 
pattern not one hundred percent reversed
but<00:00:33.160> almost<00:00:33.640> okay<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.630> previous<00:00:34.810> pattern

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
but almost okay in the previous pattern

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.139 
but almost okay in the previous pattern
we<00:00:35.260> looked<00:00:35.440> at<00:00:35.530> p<00:00:35.770> IM<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:38.129> p-i-m-p<00:00:39.129> alright<00:00:39.940> a

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
we looked at p IM a p-i-m-p alright a

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.060 
we looked at p IM a p-i-m-p alright a
little<00:00:40.390> bit<00:00:40.719> of<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.930> tongue<00:00:41.500> twister<00:00:41.530> there

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
little bit of a tongue twister there

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.740 
little bit of a tongue twister there
let's<00:00:42.550> think<00:00:42.730> about<00:00:42.789> it<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.149> first<00:00:43.390> one<00:00:43.600> we

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
let's think about it the first one we

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.639 
let's think about it the first one we
looked<00:00:43.899> at<00:00:44.050> last<00:00:44.350> week<00:00:45.129> that<00:00:45.460> was<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.879> p<00:00:46.449> IMA<00:00:47.199> PA

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
looked at last week that was a p IMA PA

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.000 
looked at last week that was a p IMA PA
MI<00:00:48.309> there<00:00:48.670> we<00:00:48.760> go<00:00:48.940> all<00:00:49.480> right<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.899> today<00:00:50.800> we're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
MI there we go all right and today we're

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.860 
MI there we go all right and today we're
going<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.160> actually<00:00:51.340> just<00:00:51.579> swap<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.449> around

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
going to actually just swap that around

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.910 
going to actually just swap that around
we're<00:00:53.050> going<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.260> do<00:00:53.410> p<00:00:53.829> am<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.940> p<00:00:55.510> IMA<00:00:56.170> right

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
we're going to do p am I p IMA right

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.770 
we're going to do p am I p IMA right
which<00:00:57.160> is<00:00:57.280> another<00:00:57.519> cool<00:00:57.820> pattern<00:00:58.149> and<00:00:58.300> just

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
which is another cool pattern and just

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.599 
which is another cool pattern and just
to<00:00:58.870> keep<00:00:58.989> things<00:00:59.050> interesting<00:00:59.469> I've<00:00:59.829> gone<00:01:00.399> it

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
to keep things interesting I've gone it

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.660 
to keep things interesting I've gone it
and<00:01:00.879> changed<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.500> chords<00:01:02.920> all<00:01:03.250> right<00:01:03.429> so<00:01:03.550> what

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
and changed the chords all right so what

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.590 
and changed the chords all right so what
I'm<00:01:03.730> going<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.879> do<00:01:04.000> when<00:01:04.150> i<00:01:04.180> played<00:01:04.390> for<00:01:04.420> you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
chord shapes i'll show you the pattern

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.950 
chord shapes i'll show you the pattern
and<00:01:09.490> we'll<00:01:09.670> do<00:01:09.759> a<00:01:09.790> slow<00:01:10.000> after<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.479> here<00:01:10.869> we

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.390

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
to show you now is a little bit of a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.070 
to show you now is a little bit of a
tweak<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.180> cord<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.990> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
tweak you can do to that cord for you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.420 
tweak you can do to that cord for you
guys<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.280> more

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
guys out there a little bit more

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.360 
guys out there a little bit more
advanced<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.440> entails<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:26.100> it's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
advanced and what it entails is it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
advanced and what it entails is it's
almost<00:02:26.550> like<00:02:26.760> an<00:02:26.910> anticipation<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.930> some<00:02:28.380> sort
