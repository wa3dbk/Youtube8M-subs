00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.080 
times I felt quite overstrained and I
often<00:01:53.750> thought<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:55.310> know<00:01:55.460> my

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
often thought that you know my

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.929 
often thought that you know my
intellectual<00:01:56.740> capabilities<00:01:57.740> were<00:01:58.189> not<00:01:58.430> up<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
intellectual capabilities were not up to

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.789 
intellectual capabilities were not up to
the<00:01:59.090> task<00:01:59.119> and<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:02.240> was<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.960> little<00:02:03.680> too

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
the task and that this was a little too

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.779 
the task and that this was a little too
much<00:02:04.009> for<00:02:04.189> me<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.369> handle<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:07.130> guess<00:02:07.250> that's

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
much for me to handle but I guess that's

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.150 
much for me to handle but I guess that's
mostly<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:10.070> know<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:10.579> of<00:02:10.759> my<00:02:12.160> kind

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.530 
example so immigrants in Norway in the
one<00:03:16.910> hand<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:18.010> goth<00:03:19.010> subculture<00:03:19.880> on<00:03:20.300> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
one hand and goth subculture on the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.220 
one hand and goth subculture on the
other<00:03:20.690> hand<00:03:20.930> um<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.690> analyzed<00:03:24.260> both<00:03:24.860> um<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
other hand um and analyzed both um to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.280 
other hand um and analyzed both um to
determine<00:03:28.070> in<00:03:28.790> what<00:03:28.850> sense<00:03:29.570> they<00:03:30.050> are

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
determine in what sense they are

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
determine in what sense they are
subcultures<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:33.890> not<00:03:34.070> all<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.340> coming<00:03:35.090> to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
subcultures it is not all that coming to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.780 
subcultures it is not all that coming to
call<00:03:37.310> immigrants<00:03:38.209> subculture<00:03:38.989> but<00:03:39.790> I'm

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
call immigrants subculture but I'm

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.539 
call immigrants subculture but I'm
basically<00:03:41.269> arguing<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.830> is<00:03:42.950> possible<00:03:43.489> to

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
basically arguing that it is possible to

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.539 
basically arguing that it is possible to
classify<00:03:44.060> them<00:03:44.239> as<00:03:44.269> such<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.870> why<00:03:45.230> based<00:03:45.980> on<00:03:46.250> a

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
classify them as such and why based on a

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.630 
classify them as such and why based on a
certain<00:03:47.480> subculture<00:03:48.410> theory<00:03:49.810> yeah<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.640> then

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
certain subculture theory yeah and then

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.970 
certain subculture theory yeah and then
I<00:03:53.239> analyzed<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.780> differences<00:03:54.470> between<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
I analyzed the differences between the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:02.160 
I analyzed the differences between the
two<00:03:55.390> as<00:03:56.769> minority<00:03:57.769> groups<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.930> I<00:04:00.700> discussed

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
two as minority groups and I discussed

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.850 
two as minority groups and I discussed
how<00:04:03.850> social<00:04:04.850> identities<00:04:05.330> are<00:04:05.570> managed<00:04:06.080> and

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.550 

well<00:04:09.860> basically<00:04:11.709> how<00:04:12.709> their<00:04:13.580> identity<00:04:14.560> is

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
well basically how their identity is

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.729 
well basically how their identity is
created<00:04:16.459> because<00:04:17.180> identities<00:04:18.049> are<00:04:18.290> not<00:04:18.500> as

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
created because identities are not as

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.050 
created because identities are not as
objective<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.739> autonomous<00:04:21.739> as<00:04:22.040> many<00:04:22.729> people

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
objective and autonomous as many people

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.040 
objective and autonomous as many people
think<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:24.580> well<00:04:25.580> in<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:27.110> end<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.919> came<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:29.050> a

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
think and well in the end I came to a

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.030 
think and well in the end I came to a
conclusion<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.970> don't<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.450> time<00:04:33.040> to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
conclusion that I don't have time to

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.150 
conclusion that I don't have time to
speak<00:04:34.430> about<00:04:34.580> right<00:04:35.000> now<00:04:35.240> but<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:36.650> case<00:04:36.950> any

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
speak about right now but in case any

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.120 
speak about right now but in case any
