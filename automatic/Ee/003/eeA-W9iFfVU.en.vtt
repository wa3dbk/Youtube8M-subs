00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.630
 I dont know 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.860
 what do you think if we quickly talk 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.960
 about some of the releases 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.470
 that were carried out at the autoshow of 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 detroit 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.660
 the brand of w in a very intense way 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.930
 presented three products three products 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.050
 the first one was the bmw w m2 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.550
 series 2 and series 2 that evolves from what 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.680
 that we previously knew as the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.380
 series 1 coupé you have to remember that the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.930
 brand bmw has not decided and now carry 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.680
 somehow the vehicles recover 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.900
 one to a series in even numbers and the 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.260
 vehicles are Danish in the odd numbers 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.090
 then this series 2 is a vehicle that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.830
 today 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.590
 Take what was previously known 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.120
 as a series 1 very important coupé are going to 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.190
 Two motorizations are available in 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.050
 this vehicle a four- wheel drive 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.500
 turbocharged cylinders that will be 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.930
 generating 245 horses and on the other 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.270
 side is going to be a motorization of six 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.670
 cylinders in line a custom that we 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.170
 fixed has generated us the brand since 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.040
 many years that will be delivering 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.950
 around 326 horsepower 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.420
 with regard to series 2 talk a 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.940
 little of the exterior design the truth is 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.440
 simply to say that it is a 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.980
 vehicle that has a very line 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.780
 sporty is compact is a vehicle that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.700
 he also enjoys everything that is the DNA of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.550
 the brand on the front with this 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.140
 new design of the fronts instead of w 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.090
 and on the other hand we go to the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.760
 vehicles were expected 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.190
 vehicles that maximize sportsmanship 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.410
 both in series 3 and in the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.880
 new series 4 you have to remember that this 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.580
 series 4 follows from what 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.650
 previously we knew how in series 3 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.369
 coupe good these two vehicles now 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.930
 they will provide a pair of engines or motorbikes 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.150
 they are going to really provide the same engine 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.430
 apart from all the DNA and all the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.750
 support in sports technology 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.100
 that comes in this vehicle that is

 modifies suspensions are modified 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.700
 brakes put very important inserts 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.350
 of the portfolio m what is it that gives you 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 the greatest sportsmanship a small spoiler 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.620
 in the back they change 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 slightly later stages good 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.500

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.920
 technologies to which he has us 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.980
 accustomed to the bmw brand and this team
