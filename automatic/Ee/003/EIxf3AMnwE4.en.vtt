00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.310
 It is not difficult one of the last 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.969
 agra fliers in the immediate vicinity too 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:16.269
 places to unique the sound of the 320th 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.269
 ps strong star motors of the z 37 a 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.700
 that this over 40 year old airman 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.610
 responsible for the spring threat 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.750
 recognize you at the latest as the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.290
 at least as old back at 164 2 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.770
 the 500 liter tank with urea 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.770
 fills 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.110
 after only 250 meters on the runway 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.690
 the extra for the agrarflug 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.390
 arranged work place raises 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.140
 pilot seriously emperor and controls that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.140
 Next to field 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.409
 via a subsequently mounted gps 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.049
 system allows the pilot over the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.030
 acker navigate around a uniform 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.030
 to ensure distribution of the fertilizer 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 meanwhile , the excavator feels that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 fertilizer bag for fast loading 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.110
 of the plane over the spring can scale 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 the crane driver filled the amount 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 estimate 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.470
 this method was used in the ddr under the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 lions lionberger ballad technology 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.530
 develops around 500 kilograms of fertilizer 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 The fly will always scatter 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.520
 In this case, one is enough 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520
 filling for around five hectares 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.460
 at 120 km / h working speed 15 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.979
 meter over the operator helps the suffering 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.140
 was the first distance to the next lane 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.340
 to keep the crippling cycle takes less 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.130
 than five minutes 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.870
 provided that the areas to be fertilized are 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.680
 not more than three kilometers from 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.680
 Landing place away 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.410
 the fertilizer will be over the control unit m 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 72 distributed the caravelle will be the big one 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.750
 scattered disc directly driven and 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.989
 scatters depending on the altitude is to 30 meters 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.989
 wide 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.660
 a stirrer in the stainless steel container 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.020
 ensures the trouble-free fertilizer 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.020
 River 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.360
 in our case around 60 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.360
 hectare per hour are fertilized 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 but for such an achievement are then 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.370
 also hit largest of 30 acres and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.950
 more necessary best with long and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.099
 Narrow shaped as a turn with 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.900
 currently 37 takes over a minute 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.900
 is paid after flight hours 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.900
 after one and a half hours of flight must first 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.470
 be fueled because of the payload 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 just one of the 125 liter tank 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.100
 is filled 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.030
 around 80 liters of aviation fuel are consumed by the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.030
 bumblebee per hour 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.770
 The cockpit offers little comfort over 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.959
 the wheel becomes the fertilizer quantity 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.630
 set with a print on the 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.020
 Button on joystick starts to tax 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.020
 rotate 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.250
 because the capacity of these agricultural fliers 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.889
 meanwhile pilot is serious 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.810
 emperor assumed that this type of 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.810
 probably soon be history
