I don't feel comfortable in my uniform

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.850 
I don't feel comfortable in my uniform
because<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:00.550> feel<00:02:00.789> like<00:02:00.819> two<00:02:01.300> bags<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.500> you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
because I feel like two bags and you

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:14.320 
because I feel like two bags and you
don't<00:02:03.069> like<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.580> don't<00:02:03.880> really<00:02:04.060> like

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.500 

think<00:02:15.330> about<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.140> guy<00:02:16.349> who<00:02:16.890> wear<00:02:17.430> their<00:02:18.000> pants

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
think about the guy who wear their pants

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.559 
think about the guy who wear their pants
way<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.760> guys<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
way to go I think that the guys and the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.360 
way to go I think that the guys and the
boys<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.049> were<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.500> burns<00:02:22.739> really<00:02:23.069> low

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
boys that were there burns really low

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.199 
boys that were there burns really low
don't<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.330> really<00:02:24.690> styles<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:26.209> they

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
don't have really styles because they

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:58.300 
don't have really styles because they
just<00:02:27.480> want<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.049> be<00:02:28.230> looked<00:02:29.069> by<00:02:29.340> other<00:02:29.549> people
