 how many beautiful things welcome in the canal 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 of cooking these kitchen houses is not the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.570
 my first channel you write trips to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 this channel 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 and now I'll show you a little one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 cettina because the mate giving these 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 days you asked us so much about 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.769
 to do a light thing after a meal 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 can thus to dispose of all the eats 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
 a little to exchange no if he then calls 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 need to purify and deflate 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 then programming another 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 video we postponed the week 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 next just to do this thing for you 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.640
 that you have asked us so much is a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.800
 fruit base wall what are girls 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.510
 the waters are a detox thing too 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 too formidable that they have 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 doing so much since I bought 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.390
 these here then I always put it here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 inside these on the one I got from 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.750
 tigers we made the video for you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 and my sister anyway is fine 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.270
 you can even put a container in it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.710
 a nice beaker so big 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.260
 I recommend it more because those 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.270
 they are small gradient this is a water 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.010
 that now we do that you owe it 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 prepare the day before possibly 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 the night before even if they are enough 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
 only four hours of a merger in the case 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 where even in the morning he drinks it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.869
 afternoon is fine and you will make statute 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 infusion and then after the next day 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.409
 the vintage drink the live throughout the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 day you can also keep two 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.380
 three days 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.259
 and so you purify I clashed 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.650
 cantone you have to drink only water 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.020
 here I'm 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 strange things around when you hear 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 of toxo is thought to be only that no 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.480
 it is absolutely something more than that 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.090
 you have to drink then do yours 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.710
 normal power supply obviously works as 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.600
 put yourself in the right way 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 even a bit of sports truth 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.010
 sportingly helps me so much to deflate 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 the belly to have the belly you have 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.760
 ate too much just a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 purify them no thing that not only do 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.360
 losing weight fights cellulite but 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.790
 just for health ie if you have 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.000
 loved a lot of fat in short, on the other hand 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.740
 Cholesterol is good for the heart bit of everything 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.590
 now it does access like we do 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.110
 nor do I prepare 28 miccoli I put in these 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.760
 reasons it is very simple, that is also fatigue 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 something you have to do 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.410
 you must put the note of course you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.750
 decide the fruit you prefer buy 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.610
 for example I do these these 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 two mixes and now I'll show you two 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.390
 but I know so many of you 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.940
 maybe if you want me I can do it too 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 others to the city ​​of wild strawberries 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.040
 euro strawberries if they are here 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.750
 Italian evening where there are not 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 take the brun obviously I suggest 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.120
 always to take organic god fruit 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.620
 because obviously better because so 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.840
 you can also put with all the peel 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 obviously wash well let it stay 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 a little in the water so and you can 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.080
 so the peel is good 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.420
 good and so I put this fairy tale into it 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.140
 fairy tales too good has not really 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.380
 becomes a juice of yes now of a cool 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.540
 I put this little guy in here 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.580
 and it's not too big either 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.530
 consider type you can prepare 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.930
 even a there are kind of like a flagon 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.940
 like this one you make a liter and there 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.000
 put a type 200 grams of fruit 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.590
 for better or worse I have here in the center but a 3 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.360
 struggle obviously no more nor putting 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.540
 better because it takes just that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.670
 flavor I put three strawberries in it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.010
 then I put the lemon in it 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.080
 lemon is an ingredient that is there 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.360
 always because I want purifying lemon 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.880
 these tox waters are based precisely 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.650
 on lemon because if you returned already the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.690
 video he made on my first channel 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.030
 she said to me about diet diets 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.270
 I lived every day one morning 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.180
 glass of water with with lemon because 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.670
 indeed it is very very purifying ago 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.739
 very well draining and very draining 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.930
 then it speeds up the metabolism 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.270
 therefore it activates all the metabolism of the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.100
 day and these are based right on 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.310
 lemon then lemon always put it there 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.370
 must always be 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.350
 I put three strawberries and almost a lemon 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.540
 little Sumerian 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.700
 here in this other place to have dinner 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.890
 always the lemon that protected that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.990
 the ingredient that must be 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.060
 I put it all over the skin 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.070
 because these are the organic lemons in the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.770
 our very safe sapling that doesn't 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.620
 they are chemical substances above etc. 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.420
 otherwise you can buy bio today 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.100
 you can also find bio at its market 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.260
 so you have no excuse or else 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.090
 if I am not organic I recommend it 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.550
 remove the peel because it is better 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.250
 avoid her from eating junk 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.710
 chemistry except my beloved cucumber 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.960
 I love him too outrageous 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.330
 then it helps a lot just for 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.310
 deflate delivered Pauline casero 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.180
 in fact, even eating salad is 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.390
 very good and very much bulls a 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.730
 ritual to purify is really very good 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:01.600
 then full of guess then really 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:04.000
 good I put the cucumber in it to finish 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.020
 he puts some ginger on it and with which 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.200
 I find this company here 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.180
 neglected collection and market however if 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.820
 you have maybe you can also put 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.740
 that a c is an element that suits me 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.170
 But I put them down a little because I tend them 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.280
 very very spicy it feels in the mouth 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.140
 so put this water in it is excellent 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.960
 just against your own cellulite for 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.930
 purify yourself a lot because it too 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.320
 I will defend 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.889
 it has its own invigorating function then 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.199
 cleans up a lot from this flavor a little 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.509
 I beg you, however, that I sing little 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.060
 see why, if not, I really don't 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.550
 you can drink more 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.030
 here come in I know something to pour 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.310
 water cold water quietly not 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.259
 it must be warm so this is the 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.780
 principle that must be cold though 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.780
 must stay many hours so it's not a 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.699
 infused infusion we say slow where 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.169
 do not deteriorate the properties of 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.250
 ingredients precisely because water is 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:13.099
 cold logrieco good up to and above it 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:15.889
 I'm going to cover our waters here 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.620
 of the top lemon ceriolo lemon strawberries 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.120
 ginger are delicious even as a flavor 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.190
 I like this one the most I have to 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.870
 admit that the strawberries are hard though 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.419
 that this is very interesting this 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.699
 recently I had it also like for example yes 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.820
 I have to go to the gym, but I go back years 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.349
 I had it because it helps them to resume 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.840
 all those limits you asked for 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.430
 very thirst quenching two isarco line 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.050
 changing times are draining 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.419
 timid lean anti-cellulite do 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.610
 Very well, I drink this here 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.139
 quietly there were prepared the evening 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.690
 the morning as I drink it because it is 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.669
 so I recommend you little 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.139
 I say I had to use these guys 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.510
 because they are more expensive than if you find them 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.180
 larger and better prepared for example 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.159
 this full here, of course 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.590
 increase the amount resulting sheet 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.750
 fill well and so the next day 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.320
 you can drink this does for the whole 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.300
 day 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.030
 or if you make two liters you can 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.570
 say for two days then for casey yes 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.400
 it keeps quietly so this is 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.990
 all guys i hope these waters of 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.310
 tox you liked me now 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.280
 practically I do take it 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.030
 put in the fridge and leave it up to 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.410
 tomorrow 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.780
