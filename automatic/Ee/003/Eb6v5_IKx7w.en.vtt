on this side of the Rubik's Cube very
easy<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:59.130> did<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.159> corner<00:02:00.640> start

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
easy to do you just did a corner start

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.569 
easy to do you just did a corner start
it<00:02:01.179> like<00:02:01.689> this<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.649> they'll<00:02:02.890> actually<00:02:03.039> just

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
it like this and they'll actually just

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.100 
it like this and they'll actually just
feel<00:02:03.850> right<00:02:04.119> off<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.600> there

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.339 

as<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.349> can<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:12.569> I've<00:02:13.569> just<00:02:13.599> peeled<00:02:14.110> that

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
as you can see I've just peeled that

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.110 
as you can see I've just peeled that
entire<00:02:14.650> square<00:02:15.040> off<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
entire square off of that and the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880 
entire square off of that and the
adhesive<00:02:16.420> stays<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.650> don't

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
adhesive stays on there so you don't

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.039 
adhesive stays on there so you don't
even<00:02:18.010> need<00:02:18.190> any<00:02:18.370> glue<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:18.730> anything<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.840> what

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
four white squares from this website

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.020 
four white squares from this website
that<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.680> you're<00:02:27.280> going<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.549> replace<00:02:27.910> it

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
with excuse me four different cars from

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.069 
with excuse me four different cars from
your<00:02:33.069> own<00:02:33.190> cube<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.879> that's<00:02:34.329> all<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.930> to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
your own cube and that's all you have to

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.830 
your own cube and that's all you have to
do<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.560> you're<00:02:36.160> ready<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.549> perform<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.599> right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
do and you're ready to perform all right

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.979 
do and you're ready to perform all right
so<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.530> took<00:02:38.849> green<00:02:39.849> out<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.329> orange<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.810> blue

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
so I took green out the orange and blue

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.110 
so I took green out the orange and blue
and<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.260> red<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.040> put<00:02:42.610> them<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.000> these

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and a red one and put them in these

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.740 
and a red one and put them in these
positions<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.110> cube<00:02:44.410> all<00:02:44.860> right<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.599> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
positions on the cube all right so the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.750 
positions on the cube all right so the
whole<00:02:46.900> cube<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.349> perfect<00:02:47.799> except<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.579> one

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
whole cube is perfect except for the one

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.900 
whole cube is perfect except for the one
side<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.510> now<00:02:49.720> looks<00:02:49.989> very<00:02:50.109> mixed<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:51.489> put

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
side that now looks very mixed up so put

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.910 
side that now looks very mixed up so put
your<00:02:52.090> other<00:02:52.150> tube<00:02:52.450> away<00:02:52.599> you're<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:53.349> ready<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
your other tube away you're now ready to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
your other tube away you're now ready to
perform<00:02:54.129> all<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.090> now<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.599> have<00:02:55.810> our

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
perform all right now that we have our

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.130 
perform all right now that we have our
cube<00:02:56.349> give<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.180> remember<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:58.329> sides<00:02:58.690> are<00:02:59.019> the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
cube give it remember all sides are the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.970 
cube give it remember all sides are the
same<00:02:59.379> except<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.700> white<00:03:00.940> side<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.510> now<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
same except the white side is now a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.330 
same except the white side is now a
variety<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:03.940> squares<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:05.170> colors<00:03:05.739> all<00:03:06.160> right

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
variety of squares of colors all right

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.000 
variety of squares of colors all right
here's<00:03:07.180> how<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.510> set<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.049> up<00:03:08.319> before<00:03:08.859> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
here's how you set it up before the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.220 
here's how you set it up before the
performance<00:03:09.250> you're<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.629> mix<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.140> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
performance you're going to mix up the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.250 
performance you're going to mix up the
cube<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.450> three<00:03:13.690> moves<00:03:13.989> and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
cube you do this with three moves and

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.770 
cube you do this with three moves and
you've<00:03:14.500> got<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.980> remember<00:03:15.340> these<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:16.180> in

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
you've got to remember these because in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.270 
you've got to remember these because in
performance<00:03:17.530> you're<00:03:17.680> going<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.919> reverse

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
performance you're going to reverse

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.780 
performance you're going to reverse
those<00:03:18.700> moves<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:20.019> get<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.349> back<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.799> order<00:03:21.010> so

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
those moves to get it back in order so

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.210 
those moves to get it back in order so
the<00:03:22.030> three<00:03:22.299> moves<00:03:22.569> I<00:03:22.810> use<00:03:23.260> how<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:24.010> this

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
the three moves I use how you do this

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.800 
the three moves I use how you do this
you<00:03:24.459> take<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.940> white<00:03:25.180> side<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:28.120> face<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
you take the white side and you face it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.349 
you take the white side and you face it
away<00:03:29.200> from<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.709> you're<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.639> choose<00:03:30.940> a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.699 
my second move is I take the top of the
cube<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:10.510> move<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.859> right<00:04:12.129> once<00:04:13.709> my

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
cube and I move it to the right once my

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.370 
cube and I move it to the right once my
third<00:04:15.040> move<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.940> left<00:04:16.239> side<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.049> cube

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
third move is the left side of the cube

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.520 
third move is the left side of the cube
and<00:04:17.620> again<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:18.510> go<00:04:19.510> forward<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:20.260> I'm<00:04:20.349> going<00:04:20.469> to

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
and again I go forward so I'm going to

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.800 
and again I go forward so I'm going to
do<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.829> again<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.159> is<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.610> have<00:04:25.330> orange

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
do that again here it is I have orange

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.339 
do that again here it is I have orange
on<00:04:26.020> top<00:04:26.219> the<00:04:27.219> white<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.820> facing<00:04:28.360> away<00:04:28.630> from<00:04:28.870> me

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
on top the white is facing away from me

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.890 
on top the white is facing away from me
I'm<00:04:29.890> going<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.490> turn<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:31.000> right<00:04:31.180> side<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
I'm going to turn the right side of the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.610 
I'm going to turn the right side of the
cube<00:04:32.200> forward<00:04:32.770> what's<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.479> top<00:04:34.810> I'm<00:04:35.140> going<00:04:35.530> to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
cube forward what's the top I'm going to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.580 
cube forward what's the top I'm going to
go<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.039> right<00:04:36.219> once<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.940> on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.110> left<00:04:38.380> I'm

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
go to the right once and on the left I'm

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.520 
go to the right once and on the left I'm
going<00:04:38.979> to<00:04:39.130> go<00:04:39.280> forward<00:04:39.909> so<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:41.229> right

I'm explaining and I'm going to do the

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.800 
I'm explaining and I'm going to do the
moves<00:05:47.889> in<00:05:48.279> Reverse<00:05:48.729> but<00:05:48.969> I<00:05:49.029> never<00:05:49.300> want<00:05:49.690> this

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
moves in Reverse but I never want this

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.190 
moves in Reverse but I never want this
to<00:05:50.229> be<00:05:50.909> anywhere<00:05:51.909> but<00:05:52.150> facing<00:05:52.659> the<00:05:52.690> audience

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
to be anywhere but facing the audience

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.629

so<00:05:53.320> I'm<00:05:53.380> say<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.680> know<00:05:53.919> how<00:05:54.039> a<00:05:54.070> Rubik's<00:05:54.580> Cube

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
so I'm say you know how a Rubik's Cube

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.010 
so I'm say you know how a Rubik's Cube
words<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.570> take<00:05:55.779> whole<00:05:56.020> sides<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:58.020> you

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
words you take whole sides and you you

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.089 
words you take whole sides and you you
just<00:05:59.260> turn<00:05:59.950> them<00:06:00.130> like<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:01.919> but<00:06:02.919> you<00:06:03.070> can

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
just turn them like this but you can

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.920 
just turn them like this but you can
turn<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:03.760> you're<00:06:03.909> blue<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.270> face<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.570> you

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
turn that you're blue in the face of you

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.750 
turn that you're blue in the face of you
you'll<00:06:05.229> just<00:06:05.560> we'll<00:06:05.770> never<00:06:05.979> get<00:06:06.219> a<00:06:06.279> rubik's

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
you'll just we'll never get a rubik's

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.810 
you'll just we'll never get a rubik's
cube<00:06:07.060> fixed<00:06:07.590> now<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.650> audience<00:06:09.310> is<00:06:09.580> only

it's<00:06:17.169> fixed<00:06:17.380> up<00:06:17.620> everywhere<00:06:18.130> so<00:06:18.789> they<00:06:19.029> see

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
it's fixed up everywhere so they see

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.870 
it's fixed up everywhere so they see
that<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:19.950> sometimes<00:06:20.950> I'll<00:06:21.340> hold<00:06:21.520> it<00:06:21.669> like

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
that and sometimes I'll hold it like

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.279 
that and sometimes I'll hold it like
this<00:06:22.150> in<00:06:22.450> case<00:06:22.750> there's<00:06:23.260> audience<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:24.039> this

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
this in case there's audience to this
