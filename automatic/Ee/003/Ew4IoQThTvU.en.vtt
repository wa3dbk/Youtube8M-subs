Hi I'm Chris, and welcome to Earth Juice.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.640
This week we have been reading all about how
animals process time, and it got us wondering

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.580
whether an athlete sees the world differently
to a couch potato.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.310
Scientists from Trinity college in Dublin
Ireland along with some from Edinburgh and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.460
St Andrews University's in Scotland revealed,
in the journal 'Animal behaviour', that an

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.539
animal's perception of time is related to
their pace of life.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.579
For example, if you've ever tried to... swat
a fly and wondered why... they always seem

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.579
to escape...

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.450
That's all because they can observe motion
on a much finer timescale than us.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.370
Infact, they process the world around them
up to seven times quicker than we can.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.780
That means a looming newspaper is easy to
spot.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.880
By contrast the slow-moving leatherback turtle
processes much less information per second

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.980
than we do.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.090
Infact they see the world around three times
slower than humans.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.600
However, Dr McNally from Edinburgh University
pointed out that "There's very little point

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.630
in gaining lots of information if you just
don't have the speed to react to it".

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.659
That seems like an eminently sensible rule,
however it doesn't seem to apply to the Tiger

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
Beetle who seems to live in a kind of visionary
no man's land with eyes that can't keep up

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.899
with its lifestyle.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.119
The Beetle hunts by chasing its prey around
5.6 mph, that's 9 km/h for those who prefer

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.500
to work in metric.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.229
But the beetle's eyes can't process that much
information forcing it to stop every now just

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.299
to check that it's still going in the right
direction.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.920
So what's the science all around this?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.229
Well study leader, Dr Andrew Jackson from
Trinity College Dublin revealed that smaller

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.409
animals with fast metabolic rate, perceive
more information per unit of time than larger

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649
animals with slow a metabolic rate.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.789
Using a process called 'critical flicker fusion
frequency' researchers were able to measure

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.979
the maximum speed of flashes of light that
a individual could see before that light source

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380
was perceived to be constant.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.420
The researchers were then able to explain
that typically more agile animals can see

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.409
the world at a higher speed, potentially making
all the difference in a life or death scenario.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.259
And Professor Graeme Ruxton from St Andrews
University in Scotland added that while "Flies

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.530
might not be deep thinkers they can make good
decisions very quickly."

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.240
So if a fly sees life at high speed, where
as a turtle sees it at a much more ponderous

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.430
pace, are there differences in humans?

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.610
Can an athlete see the world quicker than
a couch potato?

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360
Well, first of all we have to understand how
we see.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.670
Now the eye acts like a light gathering organ.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.670
Light comes in, hits the retina and that signal
is then changed into an electrical one which

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.500
is passed to the brain to be processed as
an image.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.600
These images are essentially processed like
a set of photographs, but we can only do about

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.620
10 or 12 per second.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.630
Now, what you're watching is around 25 frames
per second to if we slow that to around 12,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.160
you may start to see a bit of flickering and
if we do it to 6, hopefully you'll see a series

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.820
of still images.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.000
Now of course humans are broadly similar,
it's not like we're comparing the fly and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the leather back turtle here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.830
We do all process things at about the same
rate.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.630
However, there are some differences.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.070
Athletes have been shown to track moving obstacles
sooner and to have faster reaction times than

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.430
the average human.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.750
As well as working on their physical condition,
athletes are known to train their visual skills

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.750
as well.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.470
They work on things like peripheral awareness,
speed and span recognition and hand-eye coordination,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.130
This allows them to process the world in about
240 milliseconds, compared to us mere mortals

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.900
who are likely to take about 330.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.680
So while you'll never be quite as quick as
fly, if you do get up off the couch, train

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.100
your eyes, next time you might just be able
to swat one.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:04:11.160
next time you might just be able to swat 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:35.630
one
So that's the weeks Juice.
