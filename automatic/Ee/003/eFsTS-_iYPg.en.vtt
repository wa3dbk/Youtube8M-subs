00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
Here I am at the second of the bedrock

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.030 
Here I am at the second of the bedrock
outcrop<00:00:02.939> claims<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.480> got<00:00:03.659> here<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.859> it's

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
outcrop claims I got here and it's

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.140 
outcrop claims I got here and it's
looking<00:00:05.279> really<00:00:05.430> good<00:00:05.520> just<00:00:05.850> wandering

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
great big train trestles and that one

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.030 
great big train trestles and that one
goes<00:00:31.210> right<00:00:31.300> through<00:00:31.509> that<00:00:31.960> block<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.529> stone

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
goes right through that block of stone

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.040 
goes right through that block of stone
right<00:00:33.520> there<00:00:33.570> nice<00:00:34.570> or<00:00:34.809> CD<00:00:39.000> anyhow<00:00:40.000> this<00:00:40.809> looks

good and right on my claim now I see
lots<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.510> gravel<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.470> test<00:00:44.829> here<00:00:45.159> nice<00:00:45.909> little

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
lots of gravel to test here nice little

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.660 
lots of gravel to test here nice little
spots<00:00:46.540> all<00:00:46.720> over<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.989> place<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.550> where<00:00:48.550> I'm

spots all over the place and where I'm
standing<00:00:48.850> right<00:00:49.059> now<00:00:49.210> is<00:00:49.839> basically<00:00:50.739> a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
standing right now is basically a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.680 
standing right now is basically a
natural<00:00:52.260> tailings<00:00:53.260> pond<00:00:53.559> just<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:55.120> recess<00:00:55.570> here

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
natural tailings pond just a recess here

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.990 
natural tailings pond just a recess here
recess<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.980> connected<00:01:00.519> up<00:01:00.609> with<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.850> river

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
recess not connected up with the river

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.290 
recess not connected up with the river
at<00:01:01.300> all<00:01:01.680> nowhere<00:01:05.310> nowhere<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:07.119> would

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
at all nowhere nowhere and this would

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.690 
at all nowhere nowhere and this would
take<00:01:07.500> hundreds<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.679> gallons<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.130> water<00:01:09.190> I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
take hundreds of gallons of water I

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.760 
take hundreds of gallons of water I
could<00:01:10.390> easily<00:01:10.720> run<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.050> high<00:01:11.229> bankrupt<00:01:11.679> there

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
could easily run a high bankrupt there

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.550 
could easily run a high bankrupt there
found<00:01:12.070> some<00:01:12.280> good<00:01:12.369> gold

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
found some good gold

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:29.060 
found some good gold
well<00:01:14.560> hey<00:01:14.800> go<00:01:14.950> check

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.950 

in<00:01:29.550> secrecy<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:32.510> then<00:01:33.510> purchasing<00:01:33.870> them

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
in secrecy and then purchasing them

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.090 
in secrecy and then purchasing them
around<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> corner<00:01:34.470> from<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> bridge<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
around the corner from the bridge so I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.609 
around the corner from the bridge so I
can't<00:01:35.310> show<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.560 

finally<00:01:39.400> found<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.760> gold<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:41.409> took<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.650> while

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
finally found the gold it took a while

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.520 
finally found the gold it took a while
just<00:01:43.570> digging<00:01:43.720> right<00:01:43.900> here<00:01:44.049> right<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.350> and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
just digging right here right now and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.539 
just digging right here right now and
it's<00:01:44.680> actually<00:01:44.920> coming<00:01:45.130> out<00:01:45.220> pretty<00:01:45.369> good

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
it's actually coming out pretty good

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.030 
it's actually coming out pretty good
gold<00:01:46.229> checking<00:01:47.229> over<00:01:47.380> there<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.650> bedrock

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
gold checking over there on the bedrock

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.830 
gold checking over there on the bedrock
lots<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.610> potential<00:01:48.970> but<00:01:49.299> I<00:01:49.330> just<00:01:49.600> couldn't

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
lots of potential but I just couldn't

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.800 
lots of potential but I just couldn't
find<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.290> pockets<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:52.450> here<00:01:52.659> we

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
find the pockets of it so over here we

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.830 
find the pockets of it so over here we
got<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:53.140> over<00:01:53.380> there

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
got it over there

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.450 
got it over there
somewhere<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:55.960> between<00:01:56.080> maybe<00:01:56.979> we<00:01:57.159> can<00:01:57.280> find

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
somewhere in between maybe we can find

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.490 
somewhere in between maybe we can find
that<00:01:57.610> transition<00:01:58.210> from<00:01:58.330> bedrock<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.080> gravel

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
that transition from bedrock to gravel

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.910 
that transition from bedrock to gravel
and<00:01:59.740> do<00:02:00.220> really<00:02:00.430> well<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:01.930> possible<00:02:02.320> I'll

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and do really well so it's possible I'll

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.139 
and do really well so it's possible I'll
show<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> picture<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.580> pan<00:02:03.820> once<00:02:04.030> it's

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
show you a picture of this pan once it's

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.649 
show you a picture of this pan once it's
done<00:02:04.330> because<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:06.009> last<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:06.369> was<00:02:06.399> alright<00:02:07.149> it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
done because my last one was alright it

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.170 
done because my last one was alright it
was<00:02:07.750> pretty<00:02:07.899> good

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.929 

the<00:02:14.930> goal<00:02:15.079> is<00:02:15.200> good<00:02:15.349> but<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.370> don't<00:02:16.819> think

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
the goal is good but it's don't think

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:27.040 
the goal is good but it's don't think
it's<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.209> good<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.629> other<00:02:17.900> site

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.040 

getting<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.140> agency<00:02:28.530> says<00:02:28.940> maybe<00:02:29.940> five<00:02:30.780> ten

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
getting this agency says maybe five ten

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:40.320 
getting this agency says maybe five ten
plagues<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.710> pan

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.060 

take<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.790> found<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.830> wasn't<00:02:44.830> quite

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
take it so I found it there wasn't quite

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.410 
take it so I found it there wasn't quite
what<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.280> wanted<00:02:45.610> because<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.940> was<00:02:46.030> still<00:02:46.240> just

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
what I wanted because it was still just

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.150 
what I wanted because it was still just
in<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> grapples<00:02:47.020> it<00:02:47.200> wasn't<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.620> bedrock

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
in the grapples it wasn't on the bedrock

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.620 
in the grapples it wasn't on the bedrock
I<00:02:48.310> want<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.520> find<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.850> deposit<00:02:49.270> it's<00:02:49.390> on

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
I want to find the deposit it's on

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.370 
I want to find the deposit it's on
bedrock<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.880> gold<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.240> good<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:52.600> not<00:02:52.750> great<00:02:52.960> I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
bedrock so gold is good but not great I

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.560 
bedrock so gold is good but not great I
think<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.370> site<00:02:54.610> downstream<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> bit

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
think I like the site downstream a bit

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.810 
think I like the site downstream a bit
better<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:55.930> far<00:02:56.350> even<00:02:57.280> though<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> longer
