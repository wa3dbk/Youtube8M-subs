00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in this video we will review the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.299
 properties functions and classification of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.880
 the lipids in the first videos of the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 biology series we made a definition 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 on polymers and on monomers 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 remember that polymers are molecules 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
 very large units 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 repetitive calls monomers between 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 these have to carbs 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.269
 example occurs with lipids that do not 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 all lipids are formed by 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.460
 repetitive units that's why they are not 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 considered as polymers an example 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 we have this molecule a triglycerides 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.910
 that it contains as we see in its 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.610
 composition of repetitive gas units 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.070
 and arms but we can also find 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 as lipids to different molecules that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 as we see in this scheme does not contain 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.149
 in its composition to fatty acids 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 a feature that all contain 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.430
 the Libyans are that they are biomolecules 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.199
 organic are few soluble or almost nothing 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.770
 soluble in water that's why they are 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 considered as hydrophobic molecules 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.120
 you will remember that if we place 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.640
 in a glass in a bowl of water and you 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 we add oil for example the oil does not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.899
 is going to mix 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.149
 it will float due to its low density to 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.369
 be less dense than water is going to 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.920
 move to the surface of the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.350
 container on the other hand the lipids are 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.200
 very soluble in solvents or solvents 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 not polar as the ether the benzene and the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 chloroform that favors that they can be 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.049
 extracted from cells or tissues 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 using those same substances in addition 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.780
 they are formed only by atoms of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 carbon and hydrogen a skeleton 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.649
 hydrocarbons like the one we see in 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.869
 this image carbon atoms attached to 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.209
 hydrogen atoms with few groups 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.429
 functional cells that have oxygen in the 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.670
 extreme we can appreciate the group 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.560
 functional ceo h o cars box and the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.179
 oxygen atoms we remember are 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.640
 characteristic of functional groups 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.979
 called hydrophilic that are soluble 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.079
 in water and the main feature of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.479
 the lipids we just mentioned is their 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.509
 hydrocarbon skeleton and that's the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.539
 reason for its little or no soluble in the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.160
 water therefore are clean 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.350
 hydrophobic molecules 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 and two play different functions 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.420
 biological of great importance among 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.850
 that we can consider acting as 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 energy reserves in living beings 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.680
 for example the triglycerides one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.740
 l0 molecule bound to three acids 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.600
 arms the consumption the combustion of a 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.300
 gram of lipids will give us 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.090
 approximately nine kilocalories is 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.220
 more than double what a gram yields 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.110
 of carbohydrates for example that is so 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.420
 it's only going to yield around four 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000
 kilocalories another important function 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.310
 that plays a lipid is to act 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.110
 forming part of structures a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.090
 structural function if not then 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.280
 let's remember the structure of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.620
 all cell membranes membrane 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.810
 cell phone that is one of the classes that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.430
 we will develop later is 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.710
 formed by a double layer a bilayer of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.080
 phospholipids ie Libyan attached to 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.930
 phosphoric acid and another function that 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.240
 play the clean is to act 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.430
 regulating the metabolic activity of 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.770
 cells and tissues as for example 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.740
 some hormones within them we have 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.230
 steroid hormones that is a type of 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.510
 lipids such as testosterone 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.730
 The classification of lipids is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.770
 quite varied and that because of the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.270
 chemical characteristics that possess those 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.800
 molecules but one of the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.590
 classifications that are used 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.480
 commonly divide lipids into two 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.880
 large groups the lipids to 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.340
 purifiers and lipids nós-up 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.710
 unified guides you bonuses the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.930
 first of them is characterized by the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.390
 presence of fatty acids in your 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.070
 composition and the second by the absence 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.460
 of these but if we talk about that 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.500
 bonus what thing that bonus 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.930
 let's see in the following images in 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.690
 first place the term soap comes from 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.840
 from the Latin toad is to purify 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.360
 means to turn into soap and like 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.730
 we make a soap first we need 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.750
 the presence of a lipid containing 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.340
 fatty acids ie lipids 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.739
 bonificables as we just defined 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.280
 those lipid bonuses when 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.020
 they react with alkaline substances 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.520
 hydroxide for example in this example 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.639
 we put the oxygen leader 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.310
 will react forming a soap and that 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.740
 soap contains the most fatty acids 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.440
 a fraction of the alkaline solution is 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.900
 say sodium ions and in addition it 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.449
 will form glycerin that is formed by 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.659
 the glycerol that is part of the lipid and 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.090
 the fraction of the group oxidize and what 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.580
 coming from the alkaline solution as 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.340
 we can appreciate a soap will present 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.970
 two fractions two characteristic zones 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.810
 a fat-soluble zone formed by the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.720
 acid arms and another water-soluble in that 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.409
 example by hate ions is to say the 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.090
 soaps with its fat-soluble fraction 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.970
 favors fats to dissolve 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.430
 while the water-soluble part goes to 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.919
 allow them to dissolve in the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.349
 water therefore we soaps 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.880
 allow a cleaning of the grease that 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.490
 can be found in our body 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.949
 coming from the same glands that 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.020
 we secretly therefore 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.509
 classify lipids we can take 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.370
 in consideration the presence of acids 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.200
 fatty acids or the absence of 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.900
 this is how to lipids then 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.390
 we will classify in two large groups the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.420
 lipid saponification contain acid 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.600
 arms and lipids are not effective or 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.300
 unsalable if they do not contain acids 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.030
 fatty inside the first ones we go to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.000
 find the wounded civilians to the 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.010
 phosphors injured to the skin or lipids and 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.290
 to the serious or waxes with the 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.630
 characteristic of being able to become 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.580
 soap in the presence of substances 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.920
 alkaline while they are not 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.880
 effective and do not contain fatty acids 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.550
 they are going to climb in turn in terpenes in 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.260
 steroids or prostaglandins molecules 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.070
 very important with very 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.140
 varied how to act as vitamins 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.870
 hormones membrane components between 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.030
 others some authors name the 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.920
 lipids to tone up is in turn like 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.780
 complex lipids while at 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.910
 lipids has planned us as 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.670
 simple lipids in the following video 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.920
 we will make a very profound description of 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.380
 the fatty acids that are compounds 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.070
 important organic in the composition 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.260
 of a 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.890
 number of lipids that we will study more 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.890
 ahead
