00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
just traveling alone
you<00:01:57.380> know<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.649> used<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.310> be<00:01:58.399> very<00:01:58.430> fulfilling

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
you know it used to be very fulfilling

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.090

but<00:01:59.270> all<00:01:59.810> of<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.960> sudden<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.290> doesn't<00:02:00.710> seem<00:02:01.070> to

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
but all of a sudden it doesn't seem to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.910 
but all of a sudden it doesn't seem to
be<00:02:01.310> any<00:02:01.460> more

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.400 

so<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.970> don't<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:07.750> don't<00:02:07.960> know<00:02:08.110> if<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:08.349> is

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
so I don't know I don't know if this is

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.550 
so I don't know I don't know if this is
a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.590 
a
am<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.459> done<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:11.630> tori<00:02:11.930> no

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600 

is<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.560> nice<00:02:16.800> way<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.070> feeling<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
is this just a nice way of feeling I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.190 
is this just a nice way of feeling I
don't<00:02:17.790> know

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.780 

people<00:02:24.200> people<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.800> cars<00:02:25.040> waving<00:02:25.460> me<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> lot

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
people people in cars waving me a lot

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.160 
people people in cars waving me a lot
but<00:02:25.970> they<00:02:26.090> always<00:02:26.240> do<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.660> last<00:02:26.870> minute

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
but they always do it at the last minute

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.410 
but they always do it at the last minute
so<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.380> can't<00:02:27.680> play<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.550> back<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.030> know<00:02:29.150> I'll

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so I can't play it back you know I'll

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.790 
so I can't play it back you know I'll
stretch<00:02:29.690> my<00:02:29.750> arms<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.500> look<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:30.740> the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
stretch my arms so if they look at the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.080 
stretch my arms so if they look at the
rear<00:02:30.950> view<00:02:30.980> mirror<00:02:31.310> they'll<00:02:31.460> see<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.760> but

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.949 

so<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.660> don't<00:02:37.870> know<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.410> think<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.900> think<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
so I don't know I think I think the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.570 
so I don't know I think I think the
language<00:02:41.140> barrier<00:02:41.500> definitely<00:02:42.040> contributed

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
language barrier definitely contributed

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.280 
language barrier definitely contributed
towards<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.450> think<00:02:43.690> even<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.019> i<00:02:44.080> got

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
towards it and I think even when i got

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.520 
towards it and I think even when i got
into<00:02:44.440> Texas<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:46.180> know<00:02:46.300> after<00:02:46.450> texas<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.230> next

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
into Texas you know after texas the next

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.119 
into Texas you know after texas the next

anxiety<00:02:52.470> traveling<00:02:53.470> into<00:02:53.650> Mexico<00:02:54.390> initially

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
anxiety traveling into Mexico initially

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.979 
anxiety traveling into Mexico initially
its<00:02:55.540> kind<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> unknown<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.560> know<00:02:57.989> there's
