00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.899 
living off with my Glalie as he's gonna
be<00:01:28.740> leading<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> emolga<00:01:29.759> I'm

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
be leading off with the emolga I'm

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
be leading off with the emolga I'm
thinking<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:30.630> most<00:01:30.840> likely<00:01:30.900> ish<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
thinking that he most likely ish is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
thinking that he most likely ish is
gonna<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.189> straight<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> bolts

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
gonna want to go straight for the bolts

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.880 
gonna want to go straight for the bolts
which<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.650> chance

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
which so I'm just gonna take this chance

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.830 
which so I'm just gonna take this chance
to<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.490> least<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.090> layer<00:01:36.360> spikes

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to get up at least the one layer spikes

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.359 
to get up at least the one layer spikes
but<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.560> he<00:01:37.590> makes<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.280> crazy<00:01:38.939> ballsy<00:01:39.930> play

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
but no he makes a crazy ballsy play

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
but no he makes a crazy ballsy play
predicts<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.640> spikes<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> goes<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> time

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
predicts my spikes and goes for the time

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.800 
predicts my spikes and goes for the time
and<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:44.070> thinking<00:01:44.820> okay<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.479> most<00:01:45.720> likely

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and now I'm thinking okay he most likely

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.300 
and now I'm thinking okay he most likely
is<00:01:46.200> gonna<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> thunderbolt<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.250> I'm

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is gonna go for a thunderbolt so I'm

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
is gonna go for a thunderbolt so I'm
going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> switch<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.600> Wigglytuff<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.409> he

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
going to switch into my Wigglytuff as he

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.010 
going to switch into my Wigglytuff as he
actually<00:01:49.710> ends<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.390> Encore

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually ends up going for the Encore

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
actually ends up going for the Encore
trying<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> lock<00:01:52.590> me<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.250> spikes<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.790> he

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
trying to lock me into the spikes as he

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
trying to lock me into the spikes as he
goes<00:01:54.450> ahead<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.079> both<00:01:55.470> switches<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
goes ahead and both switches into a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.429 
goes ahead and both switches into a
survivor<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.149> didn't<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
survivor I didn't want to go for the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
survivor I didn't want to go for the
wish<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.520> he<00:01:59.880> did<00:02:00.090> show<00:02:00.329> me<00:02:00.360> talk

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
wish just because he did show me talk

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.630 
wish just because he did show me talk
and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> would<00:02:01.920> obviously<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> able

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and then I would obviously not be able

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
and then I would obviously not be able
to<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> wish<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.420> thought<00:02:03.659> dazzling

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to use the wish so I thought dazzling

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
to use the wish so I thought dazzling
gleam<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.950> gonna<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.280> my<00:02:05.310> better<00:02:05.579> play<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:05.969> he

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
gleam was gonna do my better play as he

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
gleam was gonna do my better play as he
does<00:02:06.390> bring<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.719> far<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.290> said<00:02:07.530> does

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
does bring this far as I said does

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
does bring this far as I said does
practically<00:02:08.459> nothing<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.149> expecting

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
practically nothing and I'm expecting

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
practically nothing and I'm expecting
him<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> go<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.679> sludge

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
him to just want to go for the sludge

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.800 
him to just want to go for the sludge
bomb<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.760> nothing<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.390> my

wants<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> switch<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.709> survivors<00:02:14.310> I'm

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
wants to switch into survivors I'm

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.280 
wants to switch into survivors I'm
hoping<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.030> maybe<00:02:15.270> live<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> hit<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
hoping that I can maybe live a hit and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350 
hoping that I can maybe live a hit and
at<00:02:16.770> least<00:02:16.950> try<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:17.760> stealth<00:02:18.120> rocks

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
at least try to get on my stealth rocks

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.210 
at least try to get on my stealth rocks
but<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.870> not<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.050> case<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.560> he<00:02:19.980> ends<00:02:20.099> up

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
but that is not the case as he ends up

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.490 
but that is not the case as he ends up
clean<00:02:20.640> knocking<00:02:21.270> me<00:02:21.360> out<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.720> max<00:02:21.959> special

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that survivor can definitely pack a

worry about as on the double down I'm
gonna<00:03:10.650> bring<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.069> my<00:03:11.190> rampardos<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:11.970> he<00:03:12.450> ends

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630

up bringing in his survivor now I

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.130 
up bringing in his survivor now I
thought<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.910> he<00:03:15.060> would<00:03:15.180> actually<00:03:15.360> be<00:03:15.630> faster

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
thought that he would actually be faster

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.110 
thought that he would actually be faster
than<00:03:16.170> me<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.220> rap<00:03:17.400> artist<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.820> actually

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
than me but my rap artist is actually

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.330 
than me but my rap artist is actually
jolly<00:03:18.510> which<00:03:19.170> means<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:19.680> gonna<00:03:19.859> be<00:03:19.950> able<00:03:20.100> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
jolly which means I'm gonna be able to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.900 
jolly which means I'm gonna be able to
outspeed<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.810> survivor<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.670> easily<00:03:23.670> knock

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
outspeed this survivor and easily knock

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.610 
outspeed this survivor and easily knock
him<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.239> with<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> head<00:03:24.900> smash<00:03:25.109> thankfully<00:03:25.590> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
him out with the head smash thankfully I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.590 
him out with the head smash thankfully I
did<00:03:25.859> not<00:03:26.040> miss<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.459> if<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.000> had<00:03:27.209> carried

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
did not miss and if I had carried

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.729 
did not miss and if I had carried
something<00:03:27.810> like<00:03:28.019> earthquake<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.500> would<00:03:28.650> have

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
something like earthquake I would have

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.199 
something like earthquake I would have
gone<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> believe<00:03:29.700> my<00:03:29.880> other<00:03:30.000> two

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
gone for that but I believe my other two

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.300 
gone for that but I believe my other two
offensive<00:03:31.019> moves<00:03:31.319> are<00:03:31.500> super<00:03:31.530> power<00:03:31.980> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
offensive moves are super power and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.220 
offensive moves are super power and
crunch<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:33.150> because<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> did<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> dumb<00:03:34.200> thing

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
crunch just because I did a dumb thing

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.440 
crunch just because I did a dumb thing
and<00:03:34.709> brought<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.250> stealth<00:03:35.880> rockers<00:03:36.269> and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
and brought to stealth rockers and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.490 
and brought to stealth rockers and
obviously<00:03:36.780> didn't<00:03:37.019> want<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
obviously didn't want to go for the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.710 
obviously didn't want to go for the
rocks<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.920> he<00:03:38.310> brings<00:03:38.609> in<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.239> warmer<00:03:39.569> damn

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
rocks as he brings in the warmer damn

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.020 
rocks as he brings in the warmer damn
i'm<00:03:39.959> thinking<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.470> he's<00:03:40.829> gonna<00:03:41.190> easily<00:03:41.519> live

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
i'm thinking that he's gonna easily live

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.500 
i'm thinking that he's gonna easily live
this<00:03:42.630> head<00:03:42.900> smash<00:03:43.170> but<00:03:43.440> no<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.700> died<00:03:45.030> I

was honestly completely surprised about

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.979 
was honestly completely surprised about
that<00:03:49.709> because<00:03:50.459> warmer<00:03:50.880> damn<00:03:51.060> does<00:03:51.329> have<00:03:51.630> some

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
that because warmer damn does have some

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.890 
that because warmer damn does have some
decent<00:03:52.680> bulk<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.220> as<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.970> said<00:03:54.030> I'm<00:03:54.269> jolly<00:03:54.540> as
