00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.270
 in front of the camera 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.739
 good evening west look like i'm quite a big mouth 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.869
 and I know you are welcome here in the 4 and purchase 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.940
 today no longer require special attention for the unique wind book 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:23.859
 criticism and tips 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.569
 moreover by myself 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.099
 was written 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.079
 you want to know to prove that he can control the labels during the winter break 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.490
 who can take the street personally 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.640
 and thanks to a book these ordinary people are in a dip 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.589
 just like me 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.589
 which in turn deprived experts of the possibility 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.400
 They are in fact almost every other municipality in the area 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.250
 while 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.500
 I do not know 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 if the obligations have to do with an autistic die 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.990
 Saturday night 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.120
 because I am not in an open 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.400
 clearly there is still work to be done here 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 you know why not for a scooter now have a nice score further 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 at their own expense 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 I believe here openly criticized the ten children 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.270
 I want to play knows everything about it that was in the bulb region I have long than the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 col 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.040
 anyway this year 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.620
 on the basis of this book and with the help of those are not friendly people 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.620
 on your own that is faster 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 let's talk about love manners 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.370
 the oliebollen champagne after which the originally became the store 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.020
 in the beginning I start the trial with food in a restaurant in the increase 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 at this table 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.020
 I don't follow the corner 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 wageningen 117th therefore it should not be the vet first and twitter 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.810
 what are you doing here with a score from a lady 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.760
 we have 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 we reject that is doubling the danger 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.370
 China has to do with the competition and to show what I am worth 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 I now have a community there 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.649
 the team that the identity is not yet known in a restaurant in the 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:14.939
 municipality company 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.939
 then you are the polder here 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.529
 b 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:26.289
 3 according to my book page 17 the aunt toos who had nothing to do with those words 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:27.989
 to speak 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.989
 Brussels to work 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.790
 the group booked the team with 27 percent 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.689
 the coastguard reports that, for example 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.369
 about what is then the fields below 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.049
 we do have to serve our specialties on a bed of p 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.049
 read more the Dutch Antilles 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.489
 clearly on the trail and I have had the idea since then 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.439
 about the havo treatment 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.439
 This actually does not fit a lady capital Ankara 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.449
 also happy this time 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.849
 previously there was no drink 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.849
 how a little monitoring 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.429
 I don't think it's a lot 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.150
 I don't think so but I think you work in your own racing team 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.159
 hundreds of people went in more and more places you have to be logged in 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 theater maker and the debate 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.449
 the 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.879
 Mobillion start the first one that doesn't want to use a book 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.269
 so 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:00.260
 the animals 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.409
 nsk big or weak further 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.409
 for this reason 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.240
 were targeted 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.599
 stop filming 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.109
 You will see something that with this summer a stop order ignored an order 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.480
 Schiphol 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 they point out there is a neighborhood investigation 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.170
 it's not good to talk and 77 percent 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.250
 home depot that was typical has occurred the indices of the path of 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.250
 then the law so nobody has the set 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.150
 But these services are more ways to learn 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 persevere 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.830
 I would rather see locked up in the dressing room at the church the aex is not possible 

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:51.829
 different or the pony 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.150
 for the first time in the new collaboration 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.569
 that is therefore undetectable 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.569
 we live in a world where 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.150
 at around 7
