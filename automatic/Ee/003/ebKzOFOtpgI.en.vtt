and exciting video from techne bro today
we're<00:00:19.870> going<00:00:19.960> to<00:00:20.020> go<00:00:20.230> over<00:00:20.260> how<00:00:20.920> to<00:00:20.950> identify

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
we're going to go over how to identify

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.850 
we're going to go over how to identify
what<00:00:22.119> type<00:00:22.150> of<00:00:22.660> operating<00:00:23.350> what<00:00:23.680> type<00:00:23.830> of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
what type of operating what type of

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.230 
what type of operating what type of
windows<00:00:24.220> you're<00:00:24.369> running<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:24.880> what<00:00:25.060> type<00:00:25.210> of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
windows you're running and what type of

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.390 
windows you're running and what type of
addition<00:00:25.779> it<00:00:25.900> is<00:00:25.930> this<00:00:26.770> is<00:00:26.860> a<00:00:26.890> fairly<00:00:27.100> common

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
addition it is this is a fairly common

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.130 
addition it is this is a fairly common
question<00:00:27.939> really<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.270> solution<00:00:28.450> only<00:00:28.869> takes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
question really the solution only takes

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.230 
question really the solution only takes
a<00:00:29.230> matter<00:00:29.350> of<00:00:29.470> seconds<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.980> find<00:00:30.279> so<00:00:30.970> let's<00:00:31.119> get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
a matter of seconds to find so let's get

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.910 
a matter of seconds to find so let's get
right<00:00:31.390> into<00:00:31.450> it<00:00:31.750> what<00:00:32.380> we're<00:00:32.529> going<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.710> do<00:00:32.800> is

installed a 3.75 my system type this is

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.670 
installed a 3.75 my system type this is
really<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.960> part<00:01:17.140> where<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.320> going<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.500> find

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
really the part where you going to find

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.649 
really the part where you going to find
that<00:01:17.800> it's<00:01:18.100> going<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.430> add<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.790> 32-bit<00:01:19.510> or

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
that it's going to add this a 32-bit or

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.170 
that it's going to add this a 32-bit or
64-bit<00:01:20.050> operating<00:01:20.740> system<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.790> that's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
64-bit operating system and that's

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.310 
64-bit operating system and that's
really<00:01:22.420> important<00:01:22.840> when<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:22.990> comes<00:01:23.080> to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
really important when it comes to

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.600 
really important when it comes to

certain problems that you might that
might<00:01:24.760> arise<00:01:24.909> from<00:01:25.390> certain<00:01:25.720> programs<00:01:26.080> you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
might arise from certain programs you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.500 
might arise from certain programs you
have<00:01:26.230> as<00:01:26.620> many<00:01:26.830> haven't<00:01:27.280> transferred<00:01:28.090> or
