the xr2 has surpassed the man o'war to
become<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> believe<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.710> best

assault rifle in black ops 3 guys this
thing<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.429> absolutely<00:00:29.640> insane<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.890> see

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
thing is absolutely insane you can see

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
thing is absolutely insane you can see
from<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> gameplay<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.030> looks<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> burst

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
from the gameplay it looks like a burst

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
from the gameplay it looks like a burst
fire<00:00:34.950> weapon<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> would<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
fire weapon you would be right this is a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.350 
fire weapon you would be right this is a
burst<00:00:36.899> fire<00:00:37.410> gun<00:00:37.739> shoots<00:00:38.309> three<00:00:38.790> round<00:00:39.000> bursts

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
burst fire gun shoots three round bursts

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
burst fire gun shoots three round bursts
and<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.840> capable<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.890> bursting<00:00:41.550> enemies

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and it's capable of one bursting enemies

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.840 
and it's capable of one bursting enemies
out<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.660> about<00:00:42.829> medium<00:00:43.829> range<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.520> burst

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
out to about medium range the one burst

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
out to about medium range the one burst
range<00:00:45.210> isn't<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> best<00:00:46.050> throw<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.860> head

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
range isn't the best throw some head

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.260 
range isn't the best throw some head
shots<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> mix<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.059> definitely

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
shots in the mix and you can definitely

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
shots in the mix and you can definitely
go<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.930> further<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> one

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
go a little bit further with the one

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
go a little bit further with the one
burst<00:00:49.950> range<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.750> anything<00:00:51.750> beyond<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
burst range and anything beyond that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
burst range and anything beyond that
you're<00:00:52.260> gonna<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.980> burst<00:00:53.250> enemies

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you're gonna have to to burst enemies

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
you're gonna have to to burst enemies
but<00:00:54.360> you're<00:00:54.539> you're<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.110> wondering<00:00:55.620> how

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
but you're you're probably wondering how

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.880 
but you're you're probably wondering how
is<00:00:56.550> he<00:00:56.699> shooting<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.750> consistently<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
is he shooting it that consistently it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
is he shooting it that consistently it
looks<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.219> there's<00:00:59.850> never<00:01:00.149> any<00:01:00.359> changes<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
looks like there's never any changes in

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
looks like there's never any changes in
the<00:01:01.109> rate<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> fire<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the rate of fire well that's because the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.370 
the rate of fire well that's because the
xr2<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.530> fully<00:01:05.369> automatic<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.210> yes<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
xr2 is fully automatic and yes I just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.940 
xr2 is fully automatic and yes I just
said<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.580> gun<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> xr2<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.380> fully

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
said that this gun the xr2 is a fully

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.990 
said that this gun the xr2 is a fully
automatic<00:01:11.640> burst<00:01:12.630> fire<00:01:13.170> assault<00:01:14.010> rifle<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
automatic burst fire assault rifle that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.749 
automatic burst fire assault rifle that
means<00:01:15.330> again<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> shoots<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> bursts<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.549> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
means again it shoots in bursts you can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.810 
means again it shoots in bursts you can
get<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:17.970> burst<00:01:18.780> kills<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.409> enemies<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.610> when

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
get one burst kills on enemies but when

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
get one burst kills on enemies but when
you<00:01:20.939> hold<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> trigger<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.229> shoots<00:01:22.890> burst

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you hold the trigger it shoots burst

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
you hold the trigger it shoots burst
after<00:01:23.549> burst<00:01:23.939> after<00:01:24.240> burst<00:01:24.600> consecutively<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
after burst after burst consecutively so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.590 
after burst after burst consecutively so
you're<00:01:26.400> shooting<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.909> bursts<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you're shooting your bursts at the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
you're shooting your bursts at the
optimal<00:01:28.320> rate<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.040> fire<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
optimal rate of fire now I think this is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.399 
optimal rate of fire now I think this is
exactly<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:32.070> makes<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> xr2<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.869> good<00:01:34.170> into

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
exactly what makes the xr2 so good into

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
exactly what makes the xr2 so good into
my<00:01:34.560> opinion<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> best<00:01:35.310> assault<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.850> from

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
my opinion the best assault right from

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
my opinion the best assault right from
the<00:01:36.090> game<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.229> combines<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> best

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the game is because it combines the best

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
the game is because it combines the best
things<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:39.450> each<00:01:39.659> class<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.290> gun<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.860> three

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
things from each class of gun the three

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
things from each class of gun the three
round<00:01:41.340> burst<00:01:41.610> guns<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.720> fully<00:01:42.930> automatic

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
round burst guns and the fully automatic

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
round burst guns and the fully automatic
guns<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> three-round<00:01:44.880> burst<00:01:45.119> guns<00:01:45.390> we

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
guns from the three-round burst guns we

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
guns from the three-round burst guns we
have<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> potential<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:47.280> burst

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have the potential to get a one burst

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
have the potential to get a one burst
kill<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.420> makes<00:01:48.689> your<00:01:48.869> time<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.350> kill

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
kill which makes your time to kill

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
kill which makes your time to kill
insanely<00:01:50.189> fast<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> beat

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
insanely fast and you're going to beat

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
insanely fast and you're going to beat
out<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.409> weapons<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.549> also<00:01:53.790> has

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the fantastic accuracy of a burst fire

for<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.560> gun<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.950> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> extend<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.600> one

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
for this gun I want to extend the one

for this gun I want to extend the one
burst<00:02:40.260> kill<00:02:40.590> potential<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.310> far<00:02:41.730> as<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.180> could

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
burst kill potential as far as I could

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.420 
burst kill potential as far as I could
now<00:02:42.720> that's<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:43.950> Bruce<00:02:44.160> kill

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
now that's because the one Bruce kill

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.160 
now that's because the one Bruce kill
potential<00:02:44.700> although<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.330> certainly

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
potential although it's certainly

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290 
potential although it's certainly
relevant<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.010> not<00:02:47.190> lacking<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.000> any

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
relevant and it's not lacking in any

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.390

sense<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> word<00:02:48.930> especially<00:02:49.769> since<00:02:50.250> it's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
sense of the word especially since it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
sense of the word especially since it's
fully<00:02:50.610> automatic<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:52.170> could<00:02:52.530> always<00:02:52.739> be

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
fully automatic it could always be

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.100 
fully automatic it could always be
better<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.730> such<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.420> put<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.810> high

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
better and as such you can put on high

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.470 
better and as such you can put on high
caliber<00:02:55.800> round<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:56.820> that's<00:02:57.060> gonna<00:02:57.239> do

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
caliber round and what that's gonna do

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.910 
caliber round and what that's gonna do
is<00:02:57.660> simply<00:02:58.170> make<00:02:58.319> us<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.769> get<00:02:58.860> a

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
is simply make us that if you get a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.979 
is simply make us that if you get a
headshot<00:02:59.130> it's<00:02:59.400> gonna<00:02:59.489> do<00:02:59.670> more<00:02:59.910> damage<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.780> if

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
headshot it's gonna do more damage so if

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.050 
headshot it's gonna do more damage so if
you<00:03:01.200> throw<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> head<00:03:01.860> shot<00:03:02.069> into<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.610> mix<00:03:02.880> like

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
you throw a head shot into the mix like

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.300 
you throw a head shot into the mix like
if<00:03:03.269> one<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.019> your<00:03:04.200> shots<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.040> burst

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
if one of your shots of that burst

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.830 
if one of your shots of that burst
happens<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> headshot<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.569> have

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
happens to be a headshot and you have

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.860 
happens to be a headshot and you have
high<00:03:07.530> caliber<00:03:08.100> you're<00:03:08.310> able<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:09.239> one
