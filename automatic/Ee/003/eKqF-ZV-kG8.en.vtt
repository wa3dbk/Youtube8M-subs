00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.840
 and so there are two tools that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 give us the opportunity to regulate 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.279
 exposure that is that amount of light 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 which falls on the matrix of the camera 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.770
 these two instruments are called shutter speed and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.840
 diaphragm 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 but with these tools we 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.810
 you can not only affect 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
 scene exposure 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
 but also like an artist's brush to paint about 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.750
 how to use these two 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 tools to implement their 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.949
 creative ideas we are with you soon 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.660
 let's talk because it is very important because 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.360
 using aperture and shutter speed we are with you 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 we can select an object in the photo 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.850
 give a shot a dynamic or 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 use a variety of technical 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 tricks to create very 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 unusual photos 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.870
 but now let's deal with the fact that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.110
 such a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 expo steam and so shutter speed and aperture 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.920
 determines the amount of light entering 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.750
 on the camera matrix when talking about 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.180
 the exposures always mean 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.020
 some combinations of exposure values ​​and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.050
 aperture 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.060
 this combination calls the expo a pair 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.610
 there is a shutter speed and aperture is a pair 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.860
 parameters that determines the exposure 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 if you picked up the correct parameters 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.910
 then get the photos which is good 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.190
 reflects reality that is 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.470
 photo with correctly transmitted light 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 and color as we already know such 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 photos are called correctly 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.009
 exhibited by them or photos from 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.410
 correct exposure if the expo time 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.330
 it was chosen incorrectly then you will get 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.539
 too dark or too light 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.380
 photo that is neither before or 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.390
 overexposed well let's now 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.789
 repeat material from several past 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.709
 video tutorials and look at the process 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.720
 taking photographs in a complex and 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.340
 it looks like this 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 camera and photosensitive 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.729
 element for example film or matrix 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.489
 which is able to absorb light 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.380
 projected onto it through a lens for 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.880
 that the light is not constantly denounced 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 photosensitive element of it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 closes the special shutter mechanism 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.330
 shutter these curtains open on 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.610
 short time and misses 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410
 a portion of the light which is enough for 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.050
 image formation to light and 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.870
 sensitive element of this portion of the light 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.190
 can be adjusted in two ways 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.170
 diaphragm reducing or increasing 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.840
 a hole in the lens through which 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 passes light and shutter speed changing 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.210
 temporarily which shutter curtain remain 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.320
 open 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.750
 put the whole process of photographing 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.150
 can be in the form of a glass of water 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.070
 a glass filled with water is correct 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 about exhibited photographs 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.740
 frame with realistically transmitted objects 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.270
 and the lighting for filling the glass will be 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.970
 use water tap 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.490
 this is our camera time we 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.680
 open the tap with water this is an extract 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.480
 by opening and closing the tap we 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.910
 change the size of the hole inside it 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.550
 through which water flows a glass 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.590
 there is a diaphragm we can open much 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.080
 tap and glass filled with water to the brim 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.910
 in just seconds it will be 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.100
 match option when we are strong 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.830
 open the camera diaphragm and at 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.360
 this will set a very short exposure 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.220
 or we can tap slightly 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 slightly open and the water will drop by drop 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.660
 filling the glass a few minutes that is 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.640
 applied to the camera it will be 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.190
 mean that we covered a lot 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.320
 the diaphragm and exhibited a very long 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.980
 excerpt in either of these two options 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.870
 we get the same result 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.310
 the glass will be filled with water to the brim what 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.110
 applied to the photo will 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.560
 mean correctly exposed hey 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.780
 frame 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.490
 this example with a crane is very clear 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 demonstrates the interconnection of exposure and 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.610
 aperture 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.830
 impossible to separate these two tools 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.660
 one from the other is always their adjustment 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.790
 happening together and expo couple 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.160
 determines how our frame will turn out 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.080
 properly exposed to them or 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.690
 a chime might be the other way around too 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.850
 dark we will constantly return to 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.990
 the concept of expo pair that is to a combination 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.330
 shutter speed and aperture 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.220
 as this is a fundamental concept and 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.220
 without him it is simply impossible to do
