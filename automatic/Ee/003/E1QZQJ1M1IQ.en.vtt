anti-doping board thank you very much
for<00:00:30.390> joining<00:00:30.599> us<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> research<00:00:32.790> showed

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
for joining us so the research showed

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.569 
for joining us so the research showed
that<00:00:33.360> muscles<00:00:34.230> continue<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> grow<00:00:34.980> faster

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that muscles continue to grow faster

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.479 
that muscles continue to grow faster
after<00:00:35.760> steroid<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:36.899> has<00:00:37.170> stopped<00:00:37.739> how<00:00:38.370> does

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
after steroid use has stopped how does

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
after steroid use has stopped how does
that<00:00:38.579> impact<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.180> work<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.690> anti-doping<00:00:40.110> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that impact your work in anti-doping I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
that impact your work in anti-doping I
think<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.460> certainly<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> great<00:00:42.149> interest

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
think it's certainly a great interest

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.319 
think it's certainly a great interest
thing<00:00:43.140> though<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.250> remember<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
thing though we do have to remember that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
thing though we do have to remember that
the<00:00:45.450> study<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.719> performed<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.289> mice<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the study was performed on mice and the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
the study was performed on mice and the
length<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.629> looked<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.200> 3

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
length of time that they looked at was 3

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
length of time that they looked at was 3
months<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.850> found<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.270> after<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.570> 3

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
months so they found that after a 3

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.880 
months so they found that after a 3
month<00:00:51.989> period<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:52.800> evidence

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
month period there was some evidence

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.479 
month period there was some evidence
that<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> muscles<00:00:55.079> retained<00:00:55.559> extra<00:00:56.039> nuclei

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that the muscles retained extra nuclei

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.979 
that the muscles retained extra nuclei
which<00:00:56.820> enabled<00:00:57.239> them<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> grow<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.780> develop

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
which enabled them to grow and develop

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
which enabled them to grow and develop
more<00:00:58.440> rapidly<00:00:58.850> when<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.940> athlete<00:01:00.059> started<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
more rapidly when an athlete started to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580

have<00:01:20.670> looked<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.299> we've<00:01:21.750> seen

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
have looked at it too and we've seen

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.090 
have looked at it too and we've seen
that<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.610> suggests<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.990> bans<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.710> taking

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that this suggests the bans for taking

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
that this suggests the bans for taking
anabolic<00:01:26.310> steroids<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.000> increased<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
anabolic steroids will be increased to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.999 
anabolic steroids will be increased to
four<00:01:27.930> years<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> future

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
four years in the future

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800 
four years in the future
so<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> need<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.509> really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
so I think what we need to really

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.140 
so I think what we need to really
understand<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.650> whether<00:01:32.100> these<00:01:32.759> effects

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
understand now is whether these effects

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.569 
understand now is whether these effects
seen<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.570> lice<00:01:33.810> after<00:01:34.350> three<00:01:34.590> months<00:01:34.950> we'll<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
seen on lice after three months we'll be

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.760 
seen on lice after three months we'll be
able<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> humans<00:01:36.479> after<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.500> much

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
able to in humans after a much much

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.340 
able to in humans after a much much
longer<00:01:37.950> period<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.430> time<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.850> far<00:01:39.150> more

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
longer period of time so far more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
longer period of time so far more
research<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> needed<00:01:40.710> before<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.939> can

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
research is needed before I think we can

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.789 
research is needed before I think we can
categorically<00:01:42.570> state<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.079> allegoric

we have seen several examples of

we have seen several examples of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
years and then they come back and they

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
years and then they come back and they
do<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.200> well<00:01:55.409> perhaps<00:01:55.770> even

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
do really really well perhaps even

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
do really really well perhaps even
better<00:01:56.280> than<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.670> did<00:01:56.729> before<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.780> were

banned what does this research make you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.289 
banned what does this research make you
think<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.829> examples<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.670> think

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
think about examples like that I think

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
think about examples like that I think
first<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.869> foremost<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.530> suggest<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
first and foremost it does suggest that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.249 
first and foremost it does suggest that
a<00:02:05.250> two-year<00:02:05.670> ban<00:02:05.850> may<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.570> too<00:02:06.750> short<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a two-year ban may well be too short and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.389 
a two-year ban may well be too short and
that's<00:02:07.409> something<00:02:07.680> we've<00:02:07.950> certainly<00:02:08.250> been

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that's something we've certainly been

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.360 
that's something we've certainly been
advocating<00:02:09.319> for<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.530> review<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
advocating for a review of that and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.190 
advocating for a review of that and
potentially<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:12.030> change<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.510> an<00:02:12.599> inker

what<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.739> know<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.159> when<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.519> exercise

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
what we know is that when you exercise

what we know is that when you exercise
the<00:02:15.390> human<00:02:15.659> muscle<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.019> get<00:02:16.170> what's<00:02:16.379> called

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
the human muscle you get what's called

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.740 
the human muscle you get what's called
hypertrophy<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.609> get<00:02:17.730> extra<00:02:18.030> protein<00:02:18.480> being

laid<00:02:18.989> down<00:02:19.109> in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.319> muscle<00:02:19.650> which<00:02:20.250> makes<00:02:20.459> the

laid down in the muscle which makes the

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.729 
laid down in the muscle which makes the
muscle<00:02:20.849> bigger<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.450> stronger<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.230> clearly

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
muscle bigger and stronger and clearly

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.140 
muscle bigger and stronger and clearly
with<00:02:22.859> anabolic<00:02:23.280> steroids<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.879> can<00:02:24.030> achieve

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
with anabolic steroids you can achieve

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.869 
with anabolic steroids you can achieve
that<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.930> an<00:02:25.019> even<00:02:25.230> greater<00:02:25.560> effect<00:02:25.859> now<00:02:26.760> if

that to an even greater effect now if

that to an even greater effect now if

very good strength and very good muscles

very good strength and very good muscles
without<00:02:46.530> taking<00:02:46.950> steroids<00:02:47.370> that's<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.000> we

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
without taking steroids that's what we

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.280 
without taking steroids that's what we
advocate<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.840> what<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.049> want<00:02:49.230> people

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
advocate and that's what we want people

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.679 
advocate and that's what we want people
to<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.030> need<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.299> now<00:02:51.419> see<00:02:51.629> is

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
to do so what we need to now see is

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.420 
to do so what we need to now see is
whether<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.079> anabolic<00:02:52.319> steroids<00:02:52.950> really

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
whether the anabolic steroids really

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.580 
whether the anabolic steroids really
have<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.609> long-term<00:02:54.269> effect<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.109> think<00:02:55.319> we

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
have a long-term effect and I think we

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
have a long-term effect and I think we
all<00:02:55.680> welcome<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.340> research<00:02:56.700> that's<00:02:56.909> been

there<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.719> it<00:03:00.810> does<00:03:01.019> certainly<00:03:01.500> reveal<00:03:02.159> a

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
there but it does certainly reveal a

there but it does certainly reveal a
need<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.579> far<00:03:02.790> more<00:03:02.819> work<00:03:03.209> before<00:03:03.599> we<00:03:03.689> can

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
need for far more work before we can

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.479 
need for far more work before we can
categorically<00:03:04.319> say<00:03:04.560> as<00:03:04.859> I've<00:03:04.980> said<00:03:05.159> just<00:03:05.370> that

categorically say as I've said just that

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.670 
categorically say as I've said just that
that<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> hasn't<00:03:06.359> effect<00:03:06.719> on<00:03:06.870> humans<00:03:07.530> and

that this hasn't effect on humans and
