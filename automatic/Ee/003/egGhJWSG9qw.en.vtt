00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.290 
I just saw this video and I'll probably

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.610 
I just saw this video and I'll probably
reply<00:00:03.800> to<00:00:03.860> it<00:00:04.100> um<00:00:04.939> there<00:00:05.540> was<00:00:05.600> a<00:00:05.660> hyena<00:00:06.230> eating

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
reply to it um there was a hyena eating

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.030 
reply to it um there was a hyena eating
while<00:00:07.460> trying<00:00:07.910> to<00:00:08.149> beat<00:00:08.420> a<00:00:08.600> warthog<00:00:09.170> I'm

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
while trying to beat a warthog I'm

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.770 
while trying to beat a warthog I'm
guessing<00:00:10.429> it<00:00:10.550> was<00:00:10.639> a<00:00:10.670> baby<00:00:11.000> because<00:00:11.389> it<00:00:11.660> was

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
guessing it was a baby because it was

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.140 
guessing it was a baby because it was
awfully<00:00:12.080> small<00:00:12.500> war<00:00:13.160> dogs<00:00:13.340> can<00:00:13.670> get<00:00:13.820> pretty

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
awfully small war dogs can get pretty

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.260 
awfully small war dogs can get pretty
fucking<00:00:14.719> big<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:15.230> uh<00:00:16.130> they<00:00:16.640> wouldn't<00:00:16.970> just<00:00:17.119> go

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
fucking big and uh they wouldn't just go

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.359 
fucking big and uh they wouldn't just go
after<00:00:17.390> at<00:00:17.720> one<00:00:17.990> at<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.230> time<00:00:18.529> if<00:00:18.920> it<00:00:19.100> was<00:00:19.250> a<00:00:19.279> real

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
after at one at a time if it was a real

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.670 
after at one at a time if it was a real
warthog<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.449> would<00:00:20.869> be<00:00:20.990> about<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.350> size<00:00:21.500> of

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
warthog that would be about the size of

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160 
warthog that would be about the size of
four<00:00:22.070> hyenas<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.300> that<00:00:23.750> must<00:00:23.900> have<00:00:23.990> been<00:00:24.109> a

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
four hyenas so that must have been a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.400 
four hyenas so that must have been a
baby<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:25.699> I<00:00:25.970> like<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:26.449> video<00:00:26.779> because<00:00:27.230> it

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
baby but it I like the video because it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.920 
baby but it I like the video because it
illustrates<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:28.640> battle<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:29.359> all<00:00:29.539> face

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930

morally um you know a lot of people
don't<00:00:32.809> like<00:00:32.989> to<00:00:33.019> see<00:00:33.350> animals<00:00:33.860> get<00:00:34.100> gutted<00:00:34.969> and

brutalized<00:00:36.380> by<00:00:36.649> other<00:00:36.950> animals<00:00:37.219> but<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.880> fact

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
brutalized by other animals but in fact

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.610 
brutalized by other animals but in fact
they<00:00:38.210> should<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:38.630> know<00:00:38.660> it's<00:00:38.870> not<00:00:39.020> us<00:00:39.200> doing

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
and if you dislike that then you need to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.619 
and if you dislike that then you need to

be more so in favor of technology and
plowing<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.260> landscape<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:48.920> shit<00:00:49.160> because

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
plowing the landscape and shit because

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.790 
plowing the landscape and shit because
this<00:00:49.820> is<00:00:49.969> only<00:00:50.149> what<00:00:50.420> nature<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.649> know

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
this is only what nature is you know

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.369 
this is only what nature is you know
nature<00:00:52.160> is<00:00:52.280> death<00:00:52.579> naturist<00:00:53.180> disease<00:00:53.600> nature

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
nature is death naturist disease nature

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.310 
nature is death naturist disease nature
is<00:00:54.410> pain<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.309> conflict<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.270> resolution<00:00:56.329> and

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
is pain and conflict and resolution and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.849 
is pain and conflict and resolution and
work<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.250> it's<00:00:59.059> horrible<00:00:59.629> yes<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.739> know

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
work and it's horrible yes you know

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.099 
work and it's horrible yes you know
that's<00:01:01.760> why<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.000> should<00:01:02.300> be<00:01:02.390> against<00:01:02.809> nature

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
that's why you should be against nature

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.139 
that's why you should be against nature
that's<00:01:03.350> why<00:01:03.530> I'm<00:01:03.770> not<00:01:03.980> you<00:01:04.489> know<00:01:04.520> all<00:01:04.789> pro

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's why I'm not you know all pro

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.950 
that's why I'm not you know all pro
nature<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:07.520> good<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.000> see<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.420> because

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
nature but it's good to see it because

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.550 
nature but it's good to see it because
what<00:01:09.950> was<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.280> difference<00:01:10.430> between<00:01:11.000> that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
what was the difference between that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.170 
what was the difference between that
warthog<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.890> hyena<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.520> mean<00:01:13.790> besides<00:01:13.939> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
warthog and hyena I mean besides the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.609 
warthog and hyena I mean besides the
fact<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.390> was<00:01:14.570> probably<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.840> baby<00:01:15.080> warthog

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
fact that was probably a baby warthog

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.520 
fact that was probably a baby warthog
the<00:01:16.280> fact<00:01:16.549> was<00:01:16.820> as<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.270> hyena<00:01:17.630> was<00:01:17.930> nipping<00:01:18.229> at

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
the fact was as the hyena was nipping at

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
the fact was as the hyena was nipping at
its<00:01:18.740> thighs<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.490> legs<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.360> Warthog<00:01:20.810> could<00:01:21.049> do

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
its thighs and legs the Warthog could do

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.100 
its thighs and legs the Warthog could do
nothing<00:01:21.320> but<00:01:21.710> squeal<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:22.520> run<00:01:22.580> away<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.930> is

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
nothing but squeal and run away that is

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.690 
nothing but squeal and run away that is
the<00:01:24.259> difference<00:01:24.650> between<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:25.340> carnivorous

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the difference between a carnivorous

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.300 
the difference between a carnivorous
animal<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.780> herbivore<00:01:27.259> animal<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:27.890> don't

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
animal and a herbivore animal I don't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.039 
animal and a herbivore animal I don't
know<00:01:28.369> if<00:01:28.490> war<00:01:28.729> hogs<00:01:28.909> are<00:01:29.150> herbivores<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:29.810> think

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
know if war hogs are herbivores I think

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.830 
know if war hogs are herbivores I think
they're<00:01:30.259> um<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.799> think<00:01:31.159> they<00:01:31.520> meet<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.119> but<00:01:32.630> um

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
they're um I think they meet to but um

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.760 
they're um I think they meet to but um
my<00:01:33.740> point<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.780> war<00:01:35.960> hog<00:01:36.229> was<00:01:36.590> not

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
my point is that the war hog was not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.190 
my point is that the war hog was not
defending<00:01:37.369> itself<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.850> has<00:01:37.880> tusks<00:01:38.450> why<00:01:38.960> wasn't

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
defending itself it has tusks why wasn't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.410 
defending itself it has tusks why wasn't
it<00:01:39.350> using<00:01:39.829> them<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.189> don't<00:01:40.520> expect<00:01:40.939> a<00:01:41.060> warthog

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
it using them I don't expect a warthog

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.660 
it using them I don't expect a warthog
to<00:01:41.600> actually<00:01:42.110> be<00:01:42.229> able<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.439> fend<00:01:42.740> off<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.979> hyena

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
to actually be able to fend off a hyena

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.220 
to actually be able to fend off a hyena
let

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
let

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.590 
let
on<00:01:44.290> a<00:01:44.350> group<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.830> hyenas<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.210> should<00:01:46.420> make

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
on a group of hyenas but it should make

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.230 
on a group of hyenas but it should make
it<00:01:46.660> difficult<00:01:47.200> for<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.890> hyena<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.520> eat<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.000> it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
it difficult for the hyena to eat it it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.020 
it difficult for the hyena to eat it it
should<00:01:49.660> make<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.020> have<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.860> work<00:01:51.130> at<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.460> that
