00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.960
 good is good as it was good that we had 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:11.490
 sold the lid the next thing is to remove 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.620
 the housing that contains the hard disk 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.039
 what do we want to work 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.050
 front in this case 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.599
 what we do is remove the three 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.599
 screws that they have here is pure 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.560
 2 and 3 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.560
 we run them 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 as in only a third and it tells you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 here is a figure 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.050
 how to remove this part what 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.050
 we raise 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.250
 it is a precaution 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.969
 we see exact correct of the team and then 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.950
 well with this incoming waste what 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:10.090
 has this equipment is that the motherboard 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:13.680
 and other components are we could 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 say what I do not do, in my opinion 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.070
 and another has another idea better welcome 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:26.020
 be it but it contains memories of seeing two 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.009
 this d 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.049
 of notebooks and the boy team too 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.490
 they realize the reader is by the 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.030
 size more than anything and they want to keep 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.119
 of them but what they stop me is 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.369
 to make a desktop computer if 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.979
 we have to work it 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.920
 sincerely it is preferable to use the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.130
 another team and you're not tempting in this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.909
 type of product 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.689
 there is the project now 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.689
 see also elected to roast the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.689
 drivers 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.370
 good
