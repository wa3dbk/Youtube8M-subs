00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 two 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.590
 I am all of that, friend you were 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.559
 asking all this month and gamen you 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.750
 I would invite the dance I know but after 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.700
 the last talk I'm not sure that 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.880
 gavin be for me for the race 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.710
 of the pig is more than that I also 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.649
 he invited the chicken cake festival 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.649
 it's the same but with chickens 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.390
 then you will break with him I do not know him 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.100
 I'll say go to the pig race without 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.949
 so I think about that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.079
 I prefer to be at home than to go to the dance 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.969
 with the wrong guy I understand you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 I wish I went with yaiza instead of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.000
 shock will not leave me alone and your 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.940
 poems worsened 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.900
 chris is his name I always think about that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.730
 sleep awake with the first kiss 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.730
 there is no way for me to kiss it 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.250
 when you took one with my phone, use the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.310
 Flash is better with lots of light takes 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.740
 my good side and my other good side 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.040
 take another one with mine I think it blinks at 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.250
 one with rare faces 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.729
 and it will be known all the time although 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.729
 is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 I love that carry dress thank you is so 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.990
 adjusted that I can not sit down but it was 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990
 the only one of my favorite color 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.860
 I travel standing in the limousine when 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.100
 we came had a sliding roof and this 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.930
 explain the shapes in your hair not the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.390
 I put there myself 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.560
 what do the flowers of trees look like? 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.110
 plants myself I take care of the garden and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.870
 of the carpentry with what good in the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.020
 dance i will buy more tools guys 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.050
 you did not have to come here we wanted to see you 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.360
 it's weird to go to the dance without you teach no 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.490
 you want to go with us if you have the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.650
 we'll wait for you to be ready in 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.070
 seriously it can take hours to look at your 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.070
 hair 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.700
 al and do not hear it you're always great 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.700
 you are great 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 those two had something is a long 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.510
 history 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090
 Austin met him and a warm afternoon 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.080
 it seems time of year he played the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.840
 battery and al and said they did not have something is 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 all 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.569
 I understand you'll be fine here alone 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.400
 I'll be fine I want everyone to be 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.659

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.659
