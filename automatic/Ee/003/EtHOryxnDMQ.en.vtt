hey guys what's up it's Jarek ubirr in
this<00:00:02.730> video<00:00:03.030> I'll<00:00:03.300> be<00:00:03.570> reviewing<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.110> shank

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
this video I'll be reviewing the shank

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:17.510 
this video I'll be reviewing the shank
Shou<00:00:04.560> 10<00:00:04.830> by<00:00:04.980> 10<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> shank<00:00:16.590> Shou<00:00:16.770> 10<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.160> 10<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
Shou 10 by 10 the shank Shou 10 by 10 is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.910 
Shou 10 by 10 the shank Shou 10 by 10 is
the<00:00:17.550> first<00:00:17.940> mass-produced<00:00:18.300> 10<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:19.050> 10<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.470> uses

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the first mass-produced 10 by 10 it uses

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.470 
the first mass-produced 10 by 10 it uses
a<00:00:19.949> slightly<00:00:20.250> different<00:00:20.520> anti<00:00:21.000> popping

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
a slightly different anti popping

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
a slightly different anti popping
mechanism<00:00:21.990> than<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> other<00:00:22.350> shank<00:00:22.650> shells<00:00:22.920> so

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
mechanism than the other shank shells so

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.130 
mechanism than the other shank shells so
does<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.670> prevent<00:00:23.970> those<00:00:24.119> nasty<00:00:24.630> shank<00:00:24.930> shell

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
does it prevent those nasty shank shell

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.170 
does it prevent those nasty shank shell
lock<00:00:25.320> ups<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> quality<00:00:26.609> live<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.029> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
lock ups and as the quality live up to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
lock ups and as the quality live up to
Changsha<00:00:27.599> standards<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.650> shank<00:00:28.890> shot<00:00:29.039> 10<00:00:29.220> by

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
Changsha standards the shank shot 10 by

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
Changsha standards the shank shot 10 by
10<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.609> 130<00:00:30.300> dollars<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> quite

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
10 is 130 dollars which is quite

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.240 
10 is 130 dollars which is quite
expensive

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
expensive

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.830 
expensive
however<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> cube<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> new<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> price

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
however the cube is new and the price

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
however the cube is new and the price
should<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.350> down<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.710> time<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.460> cube<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.760> quite

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
should go down in time the cube is quite

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.940 
should go down in time the cube is quite
large<00:00:36.210> being<00:00:36.510> only<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.809> tad<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.380> smaller<00:00:37.710> than

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
large being only a tad bit smaller than

large being only a tad bit smaller than
the<00:00:38.070> 11<00:00:38.399> by<00:00:38.489> 11<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.120> makes<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.600> hard

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the 11 by 11 this makes it a little hard

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
the 11 by 11 this makes it a little hard
to<00:00:39.989> handle<00:00:40.200> especially<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:41.129> those<00:00:41.250> with

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

to handle especially for those with
smaller<00:00:41.820> hands<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.629> cube<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.960> also<00:00:43.260> very

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
smaller hands the cube is also very

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
smaller hands the cube is also very
heavy<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.520> tiring<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.390> the

heavy and can get tiring to use the
turning<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> would<00:00:47.070> expect<00:00:47.430> from

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
turning is just as you would expect from

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the new anti pop mechanism works very

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
the new anti pop mechanism works very
well<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.409> help<00:01:13.590> prevent<00:01:13.890> those<00:01:14.040> horrible

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
well to help prevent those horrible

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
well to help prevent those horrible

the cube is still capable of these lock

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
the cube is still capable of these lock
ups<00:01:18.659> I've<00:01:18.810> never<00:01:19.110> experienced<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.920> during

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
ups I've never experienced when during

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
ups I've never experienced when during
assault<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> mechanism<00:01:21.689> works<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
assault the way this mechanism works is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
assault the way this mechanism works is
that<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.830> tabs<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> pieces<00:01:23.909> fit<00:01:24.299> into

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that these tabs all the pieces fit into

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
that these tabs all the pieces fit into
the<00:01:24.720> dips<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> pieces<00:01:25.799> next<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:26.369> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the dips on the pieces next to them this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
the dips on the pieces next to them this
acts<00:01:26.939> sort<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.360> torpedoes<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.320> hold

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
acts sort of like torpedoes which hold

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
acts sort of like torpedoes which hold
the<00:01:28.619> pieces<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.040> place<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.759> stickers<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> this

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the pieces in place the stickers on this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
the pieces in place the stickers on this
cube<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.840> standard<00:01:31.290> shangzhou<00:01:31.560> they

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
cube are your standard shangzhou they

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
cube are your standard shangzhou they
are<00:01:32.369> very<00:01:32.640> dull<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:32.880> bland<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> quality

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
are very dull and bland but the quality

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
are very dull and bland but the quality
is<00:01:34.049> decent<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:34.979> only<00:01:35.130> minor<00:01:35.490> signs

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
is decent as there are only minor signs

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.530 
is decent as there are only minor signs
of<00:01:35.970> wearing

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of wearing

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.420
