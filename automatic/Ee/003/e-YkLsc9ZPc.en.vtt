pretty<00:01:41.500> cool<00:01:41.619> sound<00:01:42.070> effects<00:01:42.369> as<00:01:42.520> well

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.410 

so<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.070> graphics<00:01:55.580> looked<00:01:55.759> really<00:01:56.060> nice<00:01:56.360> in

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
so the graphics looked really nice in

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.050 
so the graphics looked really nice in
this<00:01:56.689> game<00:01:56.960> I<00:02:02.979> find<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.070> sometimes<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
this game I find that sometimes the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.710 
this game I find that sometimes the
flippers<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.720> not<00:02:05.869> react<00:02:06.259> properly<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.720> that

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
flippers do not react properly and that

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.809 
flippers do not react properly and that
is<00:02:08.869> about<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.470> only<00:02:09.590> problem<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.429> find

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
is about the only problem that I find

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.050 
is about the only problem that I find
with<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.090> game<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:13.190> guess<00:02:13.880> because

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
with this game is that I guess because

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.080 
with this game is that I guess because
they're<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.600> low<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.170> screen<00:02:16.090> sometimes

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
they're so low to the screen sometimes

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
they're so low to the screen sometimes
they<00:02:17.360> get<00:02:17.450> harder<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> hit<00:02:20.890> but<00:02:21.890> other<00:02:22.100> than

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
they get harder to hit but other than

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:44.000 
they get harder to hit but other than
that<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.520> gameplay<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:24.010> pretty<00:02:25.269> cool

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.060
