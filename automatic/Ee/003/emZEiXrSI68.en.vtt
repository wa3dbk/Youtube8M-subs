software as you can see it's a pretty
light<00:00:17.970> install<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.660> only<00:00:18.779> takes<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.199> few

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
light install and it only takes a few

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
light install and it only takes a few
seconds

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.030 

you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.550 

when<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:33.940> program<00:00:34.120> starts<00:00:34.630> up<00:00:34.810> create<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.410> new

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
when the program starts up create a new

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.580 
when the program starts up create a new
project

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.800 

after<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.610> create<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.910> new<00:00:43.090> project<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.780> new

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
after you create a new project a new

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.690 
after you create a new project a new
page<00:00:44.200> is<00:00:44.350> going<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.560> pop<00:00:44.770> up<00:00:44.800> asking<00:00:45.220> you<00:00:45.520> to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
page is going to pop up asking you to

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.880 
page is going to pop up asking you to
select<00:00:45.940> your<00:00:46.090> capture<00:00:46.330> source<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:47.620> can<00:00:47.740> also

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
select your capture source you can also

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.500 
select your capture source you can also
change<00:00:48.160> some<00:00:48.400> other<00:00:48.550> settings<00:00:48.910> here<00:00:49.090> but<00:00:49.330> I'm

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
change some other settings here but I'm

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.260 
change some other settings here but I'm
going<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.660> leave<00:00:49.810> everything<00:00:49.989> at<00:00:50.320> default

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.540 

so<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.380> we're<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> main<00:00:55.830> program<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.490> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so now we're in the main program and you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.770 
so now we're in the main program and you
should<00:00:56.700> now<00:00:56.790> be<00:00:56.850> able<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.450> your<00:00:57.540> capture

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
should now be able to see your capture

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.020 
should now be able to see your capture
source<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.920> next<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.430> need<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.580> create<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.910> new

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
source so next we need to create a new

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.120 
source so next we need to create a new
sequence<00:01:00.240> so<00:01:01.080> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> menu<00:01:01.530> bar<00:01:01.560> click<00:01:01.740> on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
sequence so in the menu bar click on

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.090 
sequence so in the menu bar click on
sequences<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.060> new<00:01:03.540> sequence<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
sequences and new sequence here you can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
sequences and new sequence here you can
edit<00:01:05.250> whatever<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.940> but<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.210> just

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
edit whatever you like but I'm just

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.670 
edit whatever you like but I'm just
going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> leave<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.900> default<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.500> press

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
going to leave it at default and press

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.000 
going to leave it at default and press
ok

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.290 

so<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:11.160> we<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.370> our<00:01:11.460> sequence<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.180> can

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
so now we have our sequence and we can

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.330 
so now we have our sequence and we can
start<00:01:12.510> working<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> time-lapse<00:01:13.440> so<00:01:14.220> on

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
start working on the time-lapse so on

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.060 
start working on the time-lapse so on
the<00:01:14.430> menu<00:01:14.670> bar<00:01:14.820> click<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.300> tools<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the menu bar click on tools and then

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.150 
the menu bar click on tools and then
select<00:01:17.070> time<00:01:17.340> lapse<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:20.010> in<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
select time lapse so now we're in the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.340 
select time lapse so now we're in the
mini<00:01:20.310> /<00:01:20.490> time-lapse<00:01:20.910> here<00:01:21.660> we<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> choose<00:01:21.960> how

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
mini / time-lapse here we can choose how

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.840 
mini / time-lapse here we can choose how
much<00:01:22.500> time<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.890> pass<00:01:23.040> before<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.580> takes<00:01:23.760> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
much time will pass before it takes a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.150 
much time will pass before it takes a
frame<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.120> our<00:01:24.360> video<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.710> example<00:01:25.770> if

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
frame for our video so for example if

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.800 
frame for our video so for example if
you<00:01:26.250> were<00:01:26.370> taking<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.730> time-lapse<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.390> sun

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you were taking a time-lapse of sun

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.260 
you were taking a time-lapse of sun
rising<00:01:28.260> or<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> clouds<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:29.370> you<00:01:30.120> would

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
rising or the clouds going by you would

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.200 
rising or the clouds going by you would
set<00:01:30.480> it<00:01:30.510> anywhere<00:01:30.930> between<00:01:31.080> 10<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.280> 25<00:01:32.670> seconds

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
set it anywhere between 10 to 25 seconds

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
set it anywhere between 10 to 25 seconds
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.960> also<00:01:34.110> choose<00:01:34.410> to<00:01:34.620> have<00:01:34.710> your

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you can also choose to have your

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
you can also choose to have your
time-lapse<00:01:35.040> start<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> stop<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.390> any

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
time-lapse start and stop on any

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.500 
time-lapse start and stop on any
specific<00:01:36.780> date<00:01:37.410> or<00:01:37.440> time<00:01:38.120> when<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.360> all

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
specific date or time when you have all

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.150 
specific date or time when you have all
the<00:01:39.600> settings<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.080> want<00:01:40.200> selected<00:01:40.710> press

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
the settings you want selected press

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.620 
the settings you want selected press
start<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.550> your<00:01:41.850> time-lapse<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.420> start

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
start and your time-lapse will start

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
start and your time-lapse will start
recording<00:01:42.900> from<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.280> minimize<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
recording from here you can minimize the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.760 
recording from here you can minimize the
program<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.170> whatever<00:01:46.350> while<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
program and just go do whatever while it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
program and just go do whatever while it
records<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.430> doesn't<00:01:48.150> take<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.450> much

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
records it doesn't take up that much

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.540 
records it doesn't take up that much
memory<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.410> there<00:01:49.770> won't<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
memory so there won't be much of a

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.730 
memory so there won't be much of a
slowdown<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.240> computer<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.710> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
slowdown on your computer and you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.110 
slowdown on your computer and you can
just<00:01:52.979> leave<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> running<00:01:53.310> overnight<00:01:53.700> or

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
just leave it running overnight or

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.100 
just leave it running overnight or
however<00:01:54.450> long<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.870> want<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.050> to

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.470 
video I did at the morning sky honestly
the<00:02:41.890> quality<00:02:42.280> looks<00:02:42.430> terrible<00:02:42.909> i<00:02:43.000> know<00:02:43.060> but

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
the quality looks terrible i know but

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.880 
the quality looks terrible i know but
that's<00:02:43.629> because<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.109> film<00:02:44.409> this<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> two

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's because I film this with a two

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.759 
that's because I film this with a two
dollar<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.579> 50<00:02:45.879> cent<00:02:46.090> webcam<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:47.409> pretty

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
dollar and 50 cent webcam I'm pretty

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.460 
dollar and 50 cent webcam I'm pretty
sure<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.099> program<00:02:48.609> can<00:02:48.849> run<00:02:49.090> HD<00:02:49.359> cameras<00:02:50.140> so

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
sure this program can run HD cameras so

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.110 
sure this program can run HD cameras so
I<00:02:50.769> think<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.340> depends<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.849> type<00:02:52.090> of

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I think it just depends on the type of

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000 
I think it just depends on the type of
camera<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.629> and<00:02:53.109> it's<00:02:53.379> not<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.620> program

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
camera you have and it's not the program

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.399 
camera you have and it's not the program
