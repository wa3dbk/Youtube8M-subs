 about the homemade mask recipe 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.020
 ingredients so the lemon 1 yogurt 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.220

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.770
 it's one of the best ingredients 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.320
 to make homemade masks 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.059

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640
 vitamins into minerals and it has a content 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 also suffer the young Belgian is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.320
 very rich in zinc phosphorus 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 the sit in and selenium and then I was 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.590
 leblanc 2 must be kept 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.210
 for oily hair because it 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.950
 brings all that they protein to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.870
 know that it's the egg white that's going 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.570
 fight against the hair one can know 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.400
 that the egg in general is suitable for all 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.810
 hair types it's true we 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.940
 uses a lot for dry hair 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
 but after associating with others 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.430
 products as we are going to do it there with 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.409
 lemon and yoghurt 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.180
 it's a very good thing for people 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.760
 oily hair then you add 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 entirely the lemon so you squeeze 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.320
 all the juice that will allow to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 cleanse your hair and then also 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.330
 to be able to slow the excess of sebum therefore 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.130
 as you make this mask 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.229
 you will see that you have less 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.680
 less oily hair less and less of 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.690
 sebum 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's not going to be done once or 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.710
 obviously do the treatment on 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.119
 several several weeks this mask 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.610
 I advise you to do it twice 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.890
 per week you apply of course the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.930
 roots on everything and if you can even 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.719
 doing cranial massages that's really 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.189
 to make the mask penetrate and then 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.189
 rinse well in cold water 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.499
 concerning the first treatment it is 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.019
 a treatment with a lemon only 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:29.689
 so a lemon anti cut in half 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.010
 then he'll have the thorns and for 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.379
 henri really all the hedges the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.169
 pines do not go and feet in front 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.840
 all the pips inside there you 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:40.730
 will actually pay your hair for 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.980
 to separate your hair from which you are going 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.319
 to actually bother you well you're going 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.200
 to bother for where we see the 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.629
 scalp and with half of the lemon 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.139
 for example on the right side this is the 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.109
 left side 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.419
 you 're going to crush your case 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.939
 lemon and have the juice absorbed in 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.559
 your in your head and then you 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.739
 prepared with the other half of citizens 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:05.629
 on the other side of your hair for this 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.849
 treatment you let mass act 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.709
 for 45 minutes and then you 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.150
 rinse with cold water and that I you 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.129
 advise to do it two to three times 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.469
 per week depending on when you are 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.819
 wash your hair in fact and for at 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.819
 at least two weeks entirely 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.240
 concerning the second treatment I 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.860
 advise you to do this treatment 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.180
 with baking soda 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.830
 it's really a product that you 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.540
 can find from anywhere in the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.520
 supermarkets is not very very 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.709
 dear and that will allow you precisely 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.510
 to absorb the sebum for this treatment 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.690
 you just have to mix 3 spoons to 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.850
 bicarbonate soup with water you 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.319
 do not dare to water exactly two 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.000
 three tablespoons 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.280
 bicarbonate you have nor for that the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.680
 bicarbonate and water make a paste 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.390
 like that in less than this dough like 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.850
 for the first treatment you apply it 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.620
 created only on your roots so that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.480
 it can absorb all the sebum 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.160
 regarding the duration it's exactly 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.660
 same as for the first treatment 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.000
 that is, you will do it 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.400
 three times a week maximum 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.569
 for two weeks and then it's up to 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.190
 from that moment on that you 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.610
 start seeing tall and deficient 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.610
 motion 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.790
 now I can give you some 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.739
 tips to avoid getting fired 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.260
 it's ugly so first and 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.440
 the idea absolutely to touch your hair 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.910
 at the root like that or scratch you 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.110
 the head or anything because 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.860
 this is how you grill 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.110
 her beautiful hair 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.730
 it is absolutely not necessary to wash 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.380
 hair in hot water because that's 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.960
 the heat also that it will make grease 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.940
 your scalp so try to 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.740
 wash with warm water or 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.660
 really cold water when you have 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.700
 finished making your shampoo you 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.610
 put on the side and wurz is really 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.229
 without fooling your body with water 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.020
 cold when you dry your hair 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.919
 avoid sending them directly to 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.690
 your scalp 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.280
 because here it is the same it will the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.290
 grease while you 're coming from 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.840
 wash them so it's a pity is by 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.970
 against trying to not leave at home with 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.130
 hot air but rather privilege 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.639
 cold air or so means air 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.220
 temperate 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.530
 a last little tip do not apply 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.090
 your after shampoo on the roots 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.770
 because there you are to degrease your 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.410
 hair especially if after want to dance 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.570
 man and is applied the eventual mans to 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.430
 from here really you apply 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.530
 your after shampoo just on the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.020
 lengths it is amply enough 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.270
 this is the girls this video mask 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.039

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.950
 to have greasy hair which do not hesitate 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.960
