00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.680
 Now that the wedding is over 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.560
 this forces to burn 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.420
 the camping of april 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.549
 Father Abbot 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.609
 parrot to the room 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.609
 meadow hit the air to the side air 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.039
 instead of doing 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.240
 It is quite adequate according to the survey 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.720
 we will also talk a little 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.829
 eduardo ortego 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 the previous day 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.980
 the third duel in which mercury stood out on October 3, 1962 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.590
 card 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.359
 the first of the long-duration flights 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.359
 and the capsule was called massive design 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.480
 when the unreal gualich space suit was placed in orbit 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.110
 I start to overheat 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 threatening to cancel the flight 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.890
 managed to adjust the coolant flow and the temperature was 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.280
 controlled 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 green light for 6 hours 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 the mission was more focused on engineering is that science 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.030
 it is unknown if it is drifting to see if the automatic piloting system 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.340
 it worked correctly 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.280
 if israel did not call the chimp configuration 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.330
 he tried to throw himself by the stars but it turned out to be a difficult task of 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 get 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.100
 the course of its flight took thus real to greater altitude until the moment they have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 caused by a manned flight 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 283 kilometers 200 meters at the height of the highest orbit 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 the flight lasted nine hours and 13 minutes and the sibila sites fell into the ocean 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.649
 peaceful this time near the island of michel a flight almost without chances 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.049
 the NASA plans is going to get that Kennedy's goal will materialize and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 The new generation of spacecraft began to take shape 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.229
 the llanisca program would take two astronauts to space 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 once much more maneuverable and sophisticated 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.189
 the Soviet Union launched three more rockets bound for Mars 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.989
 was launched on October 24, 1962 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.809
 the vehicle's engine worked well after it exploded in the last 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.319
 stage 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.219
 a month later it was launched the mars 1 got successfully start the 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.719
 trajectory towards the sea 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.980
 the communications failed on the way and never more was known 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.249
 in 1962 another attempt to launch a Mars ship failed and it did not come out 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.819
 of Earth's orbit 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.819
 is supposed to have exploded the super stage 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.040
 in their desire not to be left behind the Soviets launched on Monday 4 in April 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.239
 of 1963 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.959
 after the success of the previous moon engineers and scientists were 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.560
 unsuspecting however this lunar lander did not reach our satellite and followed 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.149
 in permanent orbit 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.539
 space exploration was a dangerous goal 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.629
 there was much to learn before being able to successfully carry out a mission 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:52.150
 the next mercury flight originally piloted by leroy gordon 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.729
 cooper sons more known as hukou was the youngest astronaut of the 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.359
 market 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:05.229
 the atlas mercury 9 was launched on May 15, 1963, the first flight of the 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.979
 airplane 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.669
 before the launch from the flight control they had to wake up fat 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.859
 like the famous one because he was able to sleep anywhere and in any 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.109
 moment 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.739
 this bonus was very long 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.250
 with a duration of thirty nine 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.520
 hours and 19 minutes and spent in space longer than all the astronauts 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.129
 of mercury together 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.460
 ojú lost 22 laps to the earth 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.460
 Could be a nap while I was in trouble 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.499
 3 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:37.489
 the mission of cúper was the last of the mercury series and the last time 

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.489
 an American flew alone to space 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.229
 valentina tereshkova was so excited about yuri's flight 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.089
 gagarin that his coworkers called him the truth nonconforming 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.180
 was born on March 6, 1937 and while living in the self-government of Escobar 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:10.529
 he became an expert parachutist who wanted to fly into space 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.240
 wrote to Moscow asking to be cosmonauts 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.370
 was accepted at once for several reasons the first because his father was 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.990
 sergeant of battle tanks and war hero 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.710
 died in the winter war 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.800
 and the second because he was a member of the communist party 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.509
 Leoz choir had suggested sending a woman into space after the success of 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.210
 Canary Islands 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.160
 a body of cosmonaut women and 100 aspirants was formed 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.690
 five were selected iker Escobar was among them 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.880
 all received instruction in rocket ship engineering theory 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.820
 spacecraft were trained for flights without gravity isolation and testing 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.039
 centrifugation 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.069
 Iter Escobar learned to fly as part of his training 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.889
 On June 14, 1963, he waited for Vostok 5, taking the cosmonaut Valeri and 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:01.219
 you
