pace hits the top top of the water

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.890 
pace hits the top top of the water
they're<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.040> these<00:03:15.310> again<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.480> bit

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
they're on it and these again a bit

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.780 
they're on it and these again a bit
bigger<00:03:17.140> fish<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:17.950> see<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.310> there<00:03:18.549> it's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
bigger fish I can see it there it's

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.970 
bigger fish I can see it there it's
about<00:03:18.880> five<00:03:19.480> pound<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.200> wallowing<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.830> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
about five pound just wallowing on the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.440 
about five pound just wallowing on the
top<00:03:23.069> hopefully<00:03:24.069> because<00:03:24.640> it's<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.970> bigger<00:03:25.180> fish

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
top hopefully because it's a bigger fish

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.000 
top hopefully because it's a bigger fish
it's<00:03:25.690> not<00:03:25.750> going<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.140> fight<00:03:26.350> as<00:03:26.560> are<00:03:26.769> there's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
it's not going to fight as are there's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.789 
it's not going to fight as are there's
them<00:03:27.190> smaller<00:03:27.610> two<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.150> three<00:03:28.390> pounders<00:03:29.049> that

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
them smaller two and three pounders that

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.910 
them smaller two and three pounders that
have<00:03:29.920> been<00:03:30.130> been<00:03:30.850> catching<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:32.319> expanded

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
have been been catching on the expanded

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
have been been catching on the expanded
pellet<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:34.420> can<00:03:34.600> see<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.080> us<00:03:35.700> it's<00:03:36.700> just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
pellet you can see that us it's just

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.809 
pellet you can see that us it's just
wallowing<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.110> now<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:39.519> will<00:03:39.610> just

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
wallowing in I think now it will just

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.520 
wallowing in I think now it will just
come<00:03:40.060> towards<00:03:40.630> me<00:03:40.780> like<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.200> all<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.500> way

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
come towards me like this all the way

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.340 
come towards me like this all the way
turn<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.220> hopefully<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:47.049> one<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
turn that hopefully it's just one of
