00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.840 
you basically smash it and each smash
down<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.789> you<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.539> fire<00:01:57.899> wave<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.470> it

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
down you do you get to fire wave on it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.490 
down you do you get to fire wave on it
now<00:01:59.850> he<00:01:59.910> will<00:02:00.390> automatically<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
now he will automatically do this I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
now he will automatically do this I
think<00:02:01.830> about<00:02:01.979> three<00:02:02.550> times<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.060> something

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
think about three times or something

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.160 
think about three times or something
like<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.220> end<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.520> getting<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.630> don't

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
like that and you end up getting I don't

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.749 
like that and you end up getting I don't
know<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> distict<00:02:08.130> but<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

for<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.239> good<00:02:09.450> couple<00:02:09.660> minutes<00:02:10.019> you'll

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
for like a good couple minutes you'll

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.610 
for like a good couple minutes you'll
