have this these kind of three commands

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.539 
have this these kind of three commands
here<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.700> are<00:01:09.890> together<00:01:11.270> they<00:01:12.270> disable

here these are together they disable
Mouse<00:01:14.549> acceleration

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
Mouse acceleration

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.679 
Mouse acceleration
okay<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.119> Counter<00:01:18.659> Strike

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
okay so in a game like Counter Strike

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.620 
okay so in a game like Counter Strike
for<00:01:19.020> example<00:01:19.700> Mouse<00:01:20.700> acceleration<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.570> be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
for example Mouse acceleration can be

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.330 
for example Mouse acceleration can be
useful<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.409> sniping<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.040> something

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
useful if you're sniping or something

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
specific then we have hi here and typing

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.810 
specific then we have hi here and typing
that<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.490> give<00:01:53.670> dota<00:01:54.390> 2<00:01:55.700> priority<00:01:56.700> in

that in will give dota 2 priority in
your<00:01:57.000> CPU<00:01:57.360> usage<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> make<00:01:58.290> sure<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
your CPU usage so you can make sure that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
your CPU usage so you can make sure that
it's<00:01:58.710> running<00:01:58.829> properly<00:01:59.130> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> nice<00:02:00.390> if

having that issue so doing the windowed

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.460 
having that issue so doing the windowed
mode<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.569> nice<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.959> then<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.349> actually

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
it to be full screen you can set it to a

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.160 
it to be full screen you can set it to a
smaller<00:02:45.560> resolution<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.930> personally<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:47.989> do

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
smaller resolution I personally just do

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.839 
smaller resolution I personally just do
the<00:02:48.290> whole<00:02:48.410> screen<00:02:48.650> because<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.340> you

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
the whole screen because I like to you

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.280 
the whole screen because I like to you
know<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.000> want<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.690> entire<00:02:50.959> screen

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
know I want it to be the entire screen

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.500 
know I want it to be the entire screen
and<00:02:51.440> then<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.799> course<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.400> do<00:02:52.609> over<00:02:53.480> here

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
and then of course you can do over here

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.259 
and then of course you can do over here
you<00:02:53.780> can<00:02:53.930> do<00:02:53.989> no<00:02:54.230> border<00:02:54.620> okay<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.489> -<00:02:55.819> no<00:02:56.030> border

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
you can do no border okay so - no border

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.849 
you can do no border okay so - no border
and<00:02:56.450> what<00:02:56.959> that's<00:02:57.140> going<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.500> do<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.709> it's

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
and what that's going to do is it's

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.150 
and what that's going to do is it's
going<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.099> make<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.819> window<00:03:00.040> appear<00:03:01.040> as

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
going to make the window appear as

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.069 
going to make the window appear as
though<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.489> in-game<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.299> not<00:03:02.569> an<00:03:02.720> actual

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
though it's in-game and not an actual

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.690 
though it's in-game and not an actual
window<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.040> kind<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.250> gets<00:03:04.340> rid<00:03:04.519> of<00:03:04.579> that

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
window so it kind of gets rid of that

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.059 
window so it kind of gets rid of that
top<00:03:04.940> bar<00:03:05.209> with<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.599> X<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.079> that's<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.680> square

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
top bar with the X and that's the square

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.240 
top bar with the X and that's the square
and<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.730> little<00:03:08.540> line<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.989> minimize<00:03:09.349> it<00:03:09.590> okay

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
and the little line to minimize it okay

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.140 
and the little line to minimize it okay
so<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.299> should<00:03:11.329> fix<00:03:11.930> or<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:13.280> should<00:03:13.459> make

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
so that should fix or that should make

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.119 
so that should fix or that should make
it<00:03:14.359> much<00:03:14.599> easier<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:15.049> alt<00:03:15.230> tab<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:15.980> other

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
it much easier to alt tab and do other

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.720 
it much easier to alt tab and do other
things

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
things

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.400
