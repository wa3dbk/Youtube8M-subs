 Barber shares his experience 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.250
 Vyacheslav Dudinka 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.250
 let's 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.080
 continuing the topic of basic haircut techniques i 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.450
 I will tell you today about the process of shading 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.579
 performing scissors cutting technique on 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 comb the comb itself 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.020
 need to hold between the index and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 thumb 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.720
 here in this way with the implementation of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.190
 braiding comb moves upwards and 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.019
 when we have finished all the sections we 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.839
 turn it over and it allows us 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.270
 comb the hair and pull out the comb 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.840
 back to the original position of the canvas 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.800
 scissors 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 you need to keep the edge 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.199
 parallel to the calculation itself when performing 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 shading we make translational 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 movements with scissors and comb 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.679
 what mistakes happen when performing 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 shading this hold wrong 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.899
 combs because if you are so 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.380
 hold it then you can't do it 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:17.100
 overturn the second mistake is when 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.830
 scissors is not held parallel to itself 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.110
 calculation 3 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.679
 a very big mistake many masters 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.280
 perform shading without moving along with 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.970
 comb while trying to make a cut 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.679
 which they do on the finger 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.200
 previous plot and transverse 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:41.310
 the classic connection we completed our 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.959
 Now Iâ€™ll do this styling job 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.810
 it is on the back of the head and so we expose 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:52.200
 the angle we need the angle 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.330
 the comb should go out to the area 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.709
 for the fact that the side zone is exactly the same 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.459
 we put the same angle and cut parallel 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.390
 comb translational motion 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.390
 holding a constant angle 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 another big mistake is when 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.370
 comb with scissors like this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.810
 swims back and forth back and forth and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 this way can remain cilia 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.830
 therefore the comb should be held in 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.410
 one does not need to go anywhere to its plane 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.530
 stagger after the immediate process 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 tushevki when we roughly swelled 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.480
 unnecessary hair to us we do the process 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.480
 grinding 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.200
 when hair is more precise hair to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 hair cut with scissors on a comb 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.780
 and finally, after the shading and polishing 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.000
 we perform the polishing process he 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.840
 performed without comb 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.660
 when separate hair sticking out glasses 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.330
 they just cut it off 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.150
 be sure to look at the shape of the light 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.540
 when better to see those extra hairs 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.900
 Well, after performing sanding shading 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.359
 and polishing we got 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.859
 great shape she is absolutely 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.859
 different from the previous one 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.580
 so clearly you are convinced that the process 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.440
 haircut with scissors on the comb is very 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.220
 an important element in the arsenal of any 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.220
