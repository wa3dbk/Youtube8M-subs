00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 is connected directly to its capacity 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.379
 to give it ten directly 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.840
 type of attack is our next 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.790
 passive ability and win movie 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 in the gun swap or else you're going 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 gain film shift which is 20% of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.180
 critical with 33 cm speedy 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 which is great because you probably 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 when you just to dag you will 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 need greater mobility and the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 20% more critic will help you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.550
 a lot to finish the target our next 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.649
 kiss is number 8 and it's art 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 allows you to select where you want to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.090
 You want to play our two trepp? 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.090
 yes without that same one you would use 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.160
 simply on your foot and also increase 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.370
 the range of darkness 50% 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.399
 our next liability is 10% more damage 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 flanking what is not for nothing 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.699
 tubing with good shorts you already go 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 to be beating flanking to be able to give 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.220
 o'brien will add 5% more damage to the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.189
 his first hit of the most vulnerable 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.590
 10% damage because you're hitting 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.950
 the franchisee while the target will be 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 probably paralyzed and finally the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.439
 universe goes will is 30 points too 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 our first passive unit is a means 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.630
 force as I said force increases in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.579
 100% your endurance regeneration is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 this first passive as if he had a 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.450
 half active force 100% of the time 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.579
 Our first one will even be number 4 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.530
 508 in your neighborhood that will win 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.220
 force every time you use more than 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 drive 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 then I'll have to use that spin of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 new for you to understand why this is 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.350
 one of the strongest rooms you have 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.729
 survival within that of our bild 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.619
 like I said earlier when you 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.240
 use the spring he is giving some courses 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.189
 of generation 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.759
 The problem is that generation is a 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.820
 skill of the kidney which activates the vigo the time 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.159
 So, so, when are you catching him? 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.700
 uses the sprint tries to keep the whole fight 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.690
 within that radius of spin effect that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.430
 You will win for 15 seconds. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.160
 coming back at 3 our next 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.349
 passive skill is your pet wins 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.239
 protection for two seconds 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.480
 When you give a dowry 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.540
 it is not very useful, and not at all 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.459
 It's just a little more survival of your 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 pet every time you give a dodge 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.950
 our next sock will be number eight 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.500
 which is to gain regeneration every time 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.319
 Are you taking any of these? 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.829
 conditions that are listed here in 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.410
 own ability there regeneration as 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.470
 I already told you before, it's the same regime 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.079
 dhpp per second based on your life in 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.590
 power which increases further survival 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.870
 of this bild which is very important to 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 our next passive unit is to give 5% 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.140
 extra damage is for the entire period 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.190
 that you have above 90% of the ht 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.150
 so we 'll give one more 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.400
 recapitulated 5% damage on initial hit + 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.709
 10% damage to the face will paralyze 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 You will hit your your grandchildren with 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.079
 spider is going to hit the guy funkeado tá 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.780
 stopped it will not hit you then 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.389
 you do not miss the controls on top of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.569
 character you will keep the maximum of 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:31.680
 possible time and if hps where 90% what 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.440
 you get 5% extra damage is against the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.519
 target and finally our last one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.680
 number 12 that will be 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:45.599
 it's you, your pet from the moment you 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.840
 reach 25% of HP take 30% less than 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.220
 Damn it, it's too strong, it's only when 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.169
 it's inside the mp you get to 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.269
 realize that there are several 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.970
 situations in which you will struggle with 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.000
 minimum of hp you will speak with 345 kg 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.910
 hp and e sometimes wins the fight during 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.950
 is this lock-up period in function of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.109
 some skills like that that take 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.810
 30% damage touches you receive our streets 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.209
 will be a didi by the fact that it 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.820
 it gives you happy and media condition that is 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.010
 fully linked to build synergy 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.580
 which is basically what we are 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.820
 using for weapons we will have 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.730
 in the short good surdina struck of romance 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.890
 which is every time you found the gun goes 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.040
 give a mini ring around you 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.730
 will apply policy on 37 pitching in the 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.020
 target 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.190
 will add up to everything we've already 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.500
 show you're going around 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.210
 character will you have to spike tv going 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.070
 being funding and dealing bridge 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.840
 if you sweat for quick weapon 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.040
 to be able to finish you have more 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.880
 3 times 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.130
 flax on its target and to dag people 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.280
 will use littín which is his next hit 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.360
 Since you 're only going to be there, I'll give it to you. 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.950
 existed 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.290
 which is even more interesting in 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.060
 function of downtown Guimarães and that we 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.850
 we have this bild 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.270
 and to finish all this theoretical part 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.660
 our amulet and our jewelry will be the reb 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.570
 which is also geared to the condition of me 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.590
 and tops that is the synergy that we have 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.270
 with all our corners of the build 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.640
 one of the best functions to fit 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.530
 This bild would be the point holder. 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.210
 I was able to run content is the guy who 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.060
 usually capture a point like you 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.660
 they are seeing now and have to go 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.970
 no longer a large 1 x 1 and in case of 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.490
 2 x 2 he tries to survive the maximum 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.980
 possible until the Romanian team arrives 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.200
 Nobody's going to basically do it. 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.510
 That's what put the two strikes on the people. 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.110
 said elegant area to capture the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.610
 point and exit the enemy 's area of vision 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.290
 This makes it possible for you to look at my 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.110
 surprise as well as being able to return to strikes 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.889
 back here in the town scraps you 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.689
 that did not stop 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.819
 He 's back, you start beating. 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.759
 strong year to be able to redeem the maximum 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:06.229
 of me possible annual if necessary uta 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.229
 shock me 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.430
 is it guys it was our 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.370
 first sport in brazil two 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.530
 I hope you have enjoyed it seem 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.920
 like the dynamics of the tutorial as 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.140
 was the sink is obvious that hopes to April 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.870
 from sejus to you 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.110
 Just like the board and the shape 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.740
 a jewel for people used in the video and 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.010
 two links in the description of the video that 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.240
 a year facebook or twitter and v3 co 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.710
 especially for those who want to suggest 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.420
 new ways 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.400
 we will be protecting those who 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.600
 are more requests listening by bringing 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.270
 for you 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.070
 her as possible in the tweet always 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.760
 have to be training next continuous 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.960
 year 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.940
 now that you like a representative 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.940
 make a time can appear
