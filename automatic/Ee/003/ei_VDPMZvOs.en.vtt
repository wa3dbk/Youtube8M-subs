and Brent Celek I think that tight end
duo<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:45.040> one<00:00:45.430> of<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.579> more<00:00:45.670> underrated<00:00:45.850> duels

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.970 
think the Browns do have solid talent
defensively<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.630> do<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.290> x<00:03:18.470> factor<00:03:18.800> for

defensively to do so so the x factor for

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
defensively to do so so the x factor for
the<00:03:19.100> Browns<00:03:19.310> has<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.120> Victor<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:21.140> you

Philadelphia<00:03:29.210> Eagles<00:03:29.240> in<00:03:29.690> my<00:03:29.810> opinion<00:03:30.140> they

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
Philadelphia Eagles in my opinion they

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.720 
Philadelphia Eagles in my opinion they
have<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.650> best<00:03:30.830> offense<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.490> matchup

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
have the best offense in this matchup

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.540 
have the best offense in this matchup
Titan<00:03:32.450> is<00:03:32.540> also<00:03:32.870> another<00:03:33.050> key<00:03:33.320> thing

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
Titan is also another key thing

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.520 
Titan is also another key thing
offensive<00:03:34.550> line<00:03:34.700> defensive<00:03:35.360> line<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:36.260> could

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
offensive line defensive line it could

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.190 
offensive line defensive line it could
be<00:03:36.620> tough<00:03:36.890> for<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.460> Cleveland<00:03:38.390> Browns<00:03:38.510> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
be tough for the Cleveland Browns to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.900 
be tough for the Cleveland Browns to
move<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.500> football<00:03:39.740> however<00:03:40.400> Cleveland's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
move the football however Cleveland's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.250 
move the football however Cleveland's
defense<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.510> tough<00:03:41.690> they<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.110> best

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
defense is tough they have the best

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.290 
defense is tough they have the best
secondary<00:03:42.770> in<00:03:42.860> my<00:03:43.040> opinion<00:03:43.340> from<00:03:43.880> Corner

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
secondary in my opinion from Corner

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.390 
secondary in my opinion from Corner
corner<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.780> love<00:03:44.990> their<00:03:45.170> safeties<00:03:45.560> as<00:03:45.740> well<00:03:45.920> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
I think they have the best opportunity

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.930 
I think they have the best opportunity
in<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.620> special<00:03:48.950> teams<00:03:49.100> department<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.760> as

outstanding returner and their coverage
units<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.510> outstanding<00:03:54.200> as<00:03:54.320> well<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:54.980> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
units is outstanding as well so the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.949

can get something point all physically

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.780 
can get something point all physically
they<00:04:09.380> could<00:04:09.560> have<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.830> potential<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.280> upset

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
they could have the potential to upset

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.430 
they could have the potential to upset
Philadelphia<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.360> weak<00:04:11.540> one<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:11.900> I'm<00:04:12.200> going

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
Philadelphia a weak one but I'm going

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.440 
Philadelphia a weak one but I'm going
with<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.680> Eagles<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.760> matchups<00:04:14.240> on

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
with the Eagles I like the matchups on

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.479 
with the Eagles I like the matchups on
the<00:04:14.900> ground<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:15.500> LeSean<00:04:15.890> McCoy<00:04:15.920> will

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the ground I think LeSean McCoy will

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.070 
the ground I think LeSean McCoy will
have<00:04:16.730> some<00:04:16.940> success<00:04:17.120> running<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:17.930> football

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
have some success running the football

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.459 
have some success running the football
against<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.739> Browns<00:04:19.040> front
