00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello welcome to the first and only channel 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.569
 in all youtube where you will be able to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.820
 learn to drive a standard car or 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.920
 manual changes completely from 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
 zero simply follows each of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 our videos in the order in which 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.340
 they are published and you will find out 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.550
 how easy it is now if we go with the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550
 video 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.240
 how about friends welcome to this new 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.700
 video learn to manage from scratch my 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.200
 name is isak and this time I'm going 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.620
 to give the reasons why it is 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760
 important to know how to pass a form 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.850
 slow or slow 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.129
 in some situations I think that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.220
 you have realized that there is 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.860
 some vehicles that pass the top or the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.460
 speed reducer and dian dolo or 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.650
 that's how it is not put aside and passing it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.320
 slowly and slowly because what 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.360
 they do well, possibly because the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.470
 car come very loaded or bring 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.010
 people and get off and this causes the 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.860
 car crawls when passing the stop and what 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.560
 they pass it sideways because of this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.720
 way is the correct way to do it 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.510
 since if they did fit the line 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.130
 in a straight way because it would be more risky 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.150
 for them since they can cause a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 harm there are times where people 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.420
 for not knowing how to pass a cap what they do 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.720
 is to eat it or fly it 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.270
 and they do it incorrectly since 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.420
 there are people who are complicated 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.970
 too much to pass a cap even though 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 they called the car they prefer to eat it the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.080
 problem of these that can cause 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.409
 damage and I'll give you an example this 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.630
 that I have in my hands is the lid of the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.360
 crankcase oil box 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.180
 speeds or transmission the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.490
 transmission so that it can work 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.429
 you need oil ok and this goes down the 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.509
 box or transmission ok and this is what 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.680
 contains most of the good oil 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:16.000
 a person ate ok a cap was passed 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.120
 very quickly that he made the car to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.870
 time to get off the front 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.290
 it hits the stop it cracked or broke 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.170
 Transmission case cover ok 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.360
 by doing this all the oil in the box 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.130
 he 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.490
 it was watered ok obviously it had to 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.250
 buy the piece the piece was purchased 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.610
 bought something called adjunct that is 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.740
 what goes here that surrounds this that is more 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.560
 or less like this that we are seeing ok 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.140
 the stage was purchased, the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.770
 board had to buy 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.110
 obviously the transmission oil and 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.230
 obviously he had to pay for it 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.740
 someone would do it and well that came out a 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.130
 bit expensive obviously if you had not 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.800
 realized the person in time and would have 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.360
 continued its march then well also 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.730
 would have decomposed the transmission already 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.100
 that the transmission are gears that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.500
 they need oil to lubricate themselves 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.380
 work without oil these are arrived at 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.840
 dry and start working ok so 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.890
 forced and a series of 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.560
 problems 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.959
 all for not knowing how to pass a cap 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.080
 a speed reducer that's why 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.209
 the sequence of stops that we saw in the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.030
 previous video it is important that you 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.880
 I remember it zen and especially the garment 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.220
 to do so that you do not provoke 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.680
 No damage to the vehicle I have known 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.310
 damage as much as this one that I just had 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.910
 present as damage in directions or in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.270
 suspensions ok or in bearings 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.730
 also from those of the tires where 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.440
 the people for not knowing pass ceilings 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.230
 obviously they damage very early 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.450
 the car of something is a wear 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.180
 normal and another thing is that you damage them 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.680
 early then well 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.829
 these are some of the consequences 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.870
 for not knowing how to pass a stop I 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.520
 I recommend that you learn well the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 previous sequence that we saw so that 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.060
 none of this happens to you in the videos that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.010
 continue we are going to move on to the next 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.340
 stage which is the stage of the simulation 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.470
 so that you can see each one of 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.639
 the sequences already in action are going to be 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.060
 realize that it is very simple 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.770
 so do not worry let's continue 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.780
 watching the videos we will try to 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.150
 do it more regularly and then they 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.560
 we hope here in a next one in a 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.509
 next video of learn to drive from 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.139
 zero my name is isaac and see you 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.139
 until next time
