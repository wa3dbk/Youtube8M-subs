 everything is already clear in general the whole song 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.590
 played on three chords well only 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.590
 chorus is played 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.530
 it should be abruptly immediately 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.500
 i.e 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.980
 several have rearranged everything 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.370
 and so all the couplets I think everything is clear
