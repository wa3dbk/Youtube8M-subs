I've even seen in this game that that

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.320 
I've even seen in this game that that
the<00:03:03.650> only<00:03:03.770> deviation<00:03:04.430> was<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.820> shadow<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.210> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
the only deviation was the shadow to the

68<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.160> go<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.400> treads<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.630> mean<00:03:11.810> now<00:03:12.230> we

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
68 just go for treads but I mean now we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.630 
68 just go for treads but I mean now we
do<00:03:12.530> see<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.920> only<00:03:13.160> diff<00:03:13.340> thats<00:03:13.520> the<00:03:13.610> only

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
do see the only diff thats the only

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.460 
do see the only diff thats the only
difference<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.360> mostly<00:03:14.720> everything<00:03:15.050> else<00:03:15.320> is

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
difference and mostly everything else is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.960 
difference and mostly everything else is
pretty<00:03:15.620> much<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.830> same<00:03:16.070> i<00:03:16.280> guess<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.760> for

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
pretty much the same i guess the for

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.490 
pretty much the same i guess the for
staff<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.690> bit<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.960> difference<00:03:18.290> as

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500
