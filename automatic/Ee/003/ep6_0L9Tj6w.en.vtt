00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.720
 2 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.740
 that helps under the 900 in it 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.899
 from Sony Ericsson 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.139
 the manufacturer has around 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.139
 the packaging went virtually perfectly well 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.960
 Format held around however 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.980
 which for the cardboard cards east strengthen not for otherwise from Father das ista 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.099
 difference 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.589
 to most Sony Ericsson packaging 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.589
 but you can already see that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 right and also exciting links next to it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 a usb-stick is with it 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.020
 that is stupid Jane Mesum Turkey even virtual 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 the special thing about this book is usb-stick 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 difficult it is more and more often I can not show it 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.320
 I had a slot 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.780
 KÃ¶rting Memory Stick Micro m2 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.660
 that is to say 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 yes the same memory card I use here in the phone can not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.380
 easy 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.500
 Put in this enjoyment Basic and 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 can Almunia so very fast data with the exchange with the computer if I 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830
 here at this practical 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 Have adapter 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.600
 so much for that now usually come 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.330
 to the phone 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 because that's certainly what most of you are interested in here 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 So it is a slider 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.880
 which from the Delphi to Retz I believe it is help millimeters 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 The phone is also very light with 86 grams 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.549
 can be affected by the Rodau of Strutz 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.780
 good in the hand 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.580
 that as the cell phone so now i will look again what else in with 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.560
 the packaging is in it 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.880
 because the weather certainly also some are interested in the delivery of the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 all 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.729
 the whole thing is missing 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369
 Compartments in it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.039
 We have a USB cable here, too. "If I have one here 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.089
 I have the usb-stick with it, "or I knew I could hear one 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.549
 from both associations and in the fields with the computer to exchange 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.729
 like to still have headphones 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.569
 The whole thing is one and my phone and has also been very special 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.609
 features 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.590
 The one in which the door to music would also be explained in more detail the keywords 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.849
 may be in the SMI and Shake Control 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.849
 as such many cases Fichtes also look 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.949
 and tighten the hammer 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.979
 Pack of course Steiner is not there 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 also a charging cable of course 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.369
 and Hermann still the 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.839
 usual according to instructions and also to the pc software 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.429
 for the data exchange 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.869
