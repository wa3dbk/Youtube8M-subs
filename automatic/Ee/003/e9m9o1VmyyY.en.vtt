and they're gonna be stacked next to
each<00:02:25.170> other<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.680> they<00:02:26.040> can<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.299> thing<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
each other so they can do that thing and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.240 
each other so they can do that thing and
not<00:02:28.079> be<00:02:28.230> bothered<00:02:28.560> by<00:02:28.590> an<00:02:28.739> efficiently

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
not be bothered by an efficiently

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
aquarium next to him when you get to the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.330 
aquarium next to him when you get to the
point<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.230> actually<00:02:34.230> spray-painting<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
point of actually spray-painting the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.369 
point of actually spray-painting the
glass<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.360> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> start<00:02:36.810> off<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.140> light

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
glass you want to start off with a light

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.280 
glass you want to start off with a light
coat<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.670> hit<00:02:39.000> whatever<00:02:39.599> other<00:02:39.989> part<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
coat and then hit whatever other part of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.990 
coat and then hit whatever other part of
the<00:02:40.410> aquarium<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.459> you're<00:02:41.610> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.910> be

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the aquarium that you're going to be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.330 
the aquarium that you're going to be
painting<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.810> then<00:02:43.319> work<00:02:43.560> your<00:02:43.739> way<00:02:43.829> back<00:02:44.099> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
painting and then work your way back to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220 
painting and then work your way back to
what<00:02:44.519> you've<00:02:44.670> already<00:02:44.849> coated<00:02:45.480> once<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.079> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
what you've already coated once and just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.199 
what you've already coated once and just
keep<00:02:46.440> doing<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:47.190> method<00:02:47.459> over<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> over

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
keep doing this method over and over

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.110 
keep doing this method over and over
again<00:02:48.329> until<00:02:48.629> you<00:02:48.920> completely<00:02:49.920> black<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.430> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
again until you completely black out the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.920 
again until you completely black out the
glass<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:53.040> will<00:02:53.459> scratch<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.720> not

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
glass this will scratch it's not

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.490 
glass this will scratch it's not
absolutely<00:02:55.590> foolproof<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.970> sense<00:02:57.180> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
absolutely foolproof in the sense of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.569 
absolutely foolproof in the sense of
completely<00:02:58.500> blacking<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.370> still

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
completely blacking out so you still

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.430 
completely blacking out so you still
have<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.850> kind<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.120> careful<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.870> way<00:03:01.019> that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
have to be kind of careful the way that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.229 
have to be kind of careful the way that
you<00:03:01.530> handle<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:01.980> glass<00:03:02.670> after<00:03:02.940> it's

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
you handle the glass after it's

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.539 
you handle the glass after it's
completely<00:03:03.630> painted<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.889> does<00:03:05.040> hold<00:03:05.280> up<00:03:05.459> a

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
completely painted but it does hold up a

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.710 
completely painted but it does hold up a
lot<00:03:05.700> better<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:06.569> my<00:03:06.870> previous<00:03:07.350> latex<00:03:08.720> paint

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
lot better than my previous latex paint

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.319 
lot better than my previous latex paint
method<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.500> used<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.859> use<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.849> this<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
method that I used to use so this is the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.000 
method that I used to use so this is the
aquarium<00:03:12.569> completely<00:03:13.260> blacked<00:03:13.500> out

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
aquarium completely blacked out

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.850 
aquarium completely blacked out
a<00:03:15.099> little<00:03:15.760> setup<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:17.019> clownfish<00:03:17.650> that

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
a little setup for the clownfish that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.069 
a little setup for the clownfish that
I'm<00:03:17.920> gonna<00:03:18.099> be<00:03:18.250> picking<00:03:18.430> up<00:03:18.670> here<00:03:18.879> shortly<00:03:19.150> and
