it<00:02:51.310> works<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:51.550> well<00:02:51.790> there's<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.690> a

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it works really well there's like a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.600 
it works really well there's like a
great<00:02:53.110> two-way<00:02:53.470> communication<00:02:54.190> between<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
great two-way communication between the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.610 
great two-way communication between the
parties<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.420> think<00:02:55.660> we<00:02:55.870> sync<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.320> really

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
parties and I think we sync up really

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.560 
parties and I think we sync up really
well<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:57.310> tough<00:02:57.489> working<00:02:57.760> with<00:02:57.970> filmmakers

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.660 
well it's tough working with filmmakers
who<00:02:58.750> haven't<00:02:59.050> done<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> sport<00:02:59.980> themselves<00:03:00.550> or

who haven't done the sport themselves or

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.890 
who haven't done the sport themselves or
don't<00:03:00.850> really<00:03:00.940> understand<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.720> little

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
don't really understand the little

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
don't really understand the little
nuances<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.739> skiing<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:04.239> able<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.480> take

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
nuances of skiing so to be able to take

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.590 
nuances of skiing so to be able to take
a<00:03:04.989> film<00:03:05.950> side<00:03:06.370> after<00:03:06.970> doing<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.480> yourself

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
a film side after doing it yourself

around and get in the backcountry to a
little<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.120> think<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.570> film<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.900> year<00:03:49.930> is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
little so I think the film this year is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.630 
little so I think the film this year is
gonna<00:03:50.290> be<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> little<00:03:50.590> more<00:03:50.680> diverse<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.459> have

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
gonna be a little more diverse and have

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.490 
gonna be a little more diverse and have
some<00:03:51.850> really<00:03:52.299> cool<00:03:52.540> interesting<00:03:52.870> moments<00:03:53.410> and
