00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.560 
talk about serious business we're
talking<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.770> quad-core<00:02:05.280> processor

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
talking about a quad-core processor

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
talking about a quad-core processor
right<00:02:06.570> yeah<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.380> four<00:02:07.680> gigabytes<00:02:08.099> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
right yeah and then four gigabytes of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190 
right yeah and then four gigabytes of
RAM<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:08.939> like<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.239> said<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.629> four<00:02:09.959> that's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
RAM and like we said that's four that's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
RAM and like we said that's four that's
where<00:02:10.769> it's<00:02:10.920> gaming<00:02:11.310> capabilities<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
where it's gaming capabilities like I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.229 
where it's gaming capabilities like I
think<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.260> -<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.310> -<00:02:14.459> oh<00:02:14.640> yeah<00:02:15.030> two

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
think it's - is it - oh yeah two

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.910 
think it's - is it - oh yeah two
gigabytes<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.630> RAM<00:02:15.810> yeah<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
gigabytes of RAM yeah and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.280 
gigabytes of RAM yeah and
so<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.550> example<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.720> isn't<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> first

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so for example like this isn't the first

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.200 
so for example like this isn't the first
streaming<00:02:19.770> device<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.280> comes<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:20.820> gaming

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
streaming device that comes with gaming

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.910 
streaming device that comes with gaming
capabilities<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.020> Roku<00:02:22.380> three<00:02:22.680> have

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
capabilities like the Roku three have

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.640 
capabilities like the Roku three have
some<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.090> pretty<00:02:24.690> basic<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
some of that but it's pretty basic and I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.080

Apple<00:05:59.220> fans<00:05:59.790> had<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.090> suffer<00:06:00.330> through<00:06:00.480> about

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
Apple fans had to suffer through about

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.060 
Apple fans had to suffer through about
like<00:06:00.810> two<00:06:01.020> years<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.410> think<00:06:01.650> until<00:06:01.920> they

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
like two years I think until they

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.110 
like two years I think until they
finally<00:06:02.340> got<00:06:02.520> HBO<00:06:02.760> um<00:06:03.740> but<00:06:04.740> uh<00:06:04.770> but<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:06.030> know

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
finally got HBO um but uh but you know

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.580 
finally got HBO um but uh but you know
for<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:06.480> most<00:06:06.600> part<00:06:06.750> everyone<00:06:07.050> else<00:06:07.260> is<00:06:07.380> there

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
for the most part everyone else is there

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.190 
for the most part everyone else is there
there's<00:06:07.860> also<00:06:08.040> like<00:06:08.310> MLB<00:06:09.150> was<00:06:09.510> left<00:06:09.720> out<00:06:09.930> but<00:06:10.140> I

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
there's also like MLB was left out but I

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.810 
there's also like MLB was left out but I
think<00:06:10.380> they've<00:06:10.650> said<00:06:10.860> that<00:06:10.950> that<00:06:11.430> one<00:06:11.670> is

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
think they've said that that one is

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.090 
think they've said that that one is
definitely<00:06:12.300> on<00:06:12.450> its<00:06:12.480> way<00:06:12.660> um<00:06:13.140> what<00:06:14.010> about

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
definitely on its way um what about

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.770 
definitely on its way um what about
music<00:06:14.310> fans<00:06:14.700> what<00:06:14.910> are<00:06:15.000> they<00:06:15.060> gonna<00:06:15.210> find<00:06:15.510> here

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
music fans what are they gonna find here

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.230 
music fans what are they gonna find here
in<00:06:16.560> terms<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:17.040> like<00:06:17.220> audio<00:06:17.550> like<00:06:17.730> the<00:06:17.850> biggest

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
in terms of like audio like the biggest

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.080 
in terms of like audio like the biggest
omission<00:06:18.750> is<00:06:19.110> Spotify<00:06:19.770> which<00:06:20.490> like<00:06:20.790> you<00:06:20.820> know

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
omission is Spotify which like you know

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.810 
omission is Spotify which like you know
I<00:06:21.120> definitely<00:06:21.390> use<00:06:21.840> Spotify<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.710> so<00:06:22.920> you<00:06:23.730> know

I definitely use Spotify and so you know
I'm<00:06:24.030> I'm<00:06:24.390> more<00:06:24.600> inclined<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:24.990> use<00:06:25.050> Roku

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
I'm I'm more inclined to use Roku

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.550 
I'm I'm more inclined to use Roku
because<00:06:25.770> they<00:06:26.070> have<00:06:26.280> Spotify<00:06:26.840> but<00:06:27.840> but<00:06:28.170> Amazon

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
because they have Spotify but but Amazon

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
because they have Spotify but but Amazon
said<00:06:28.710> that<00:06:28.830> they're<00:06:28.950> also<00:06:29.100> working<00:06:29.430> with

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
Spotify to eventually get them on there

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.800 
Spotify to eventually get them on there
and<00:06:31.950> and<00:06:32.460> you<00:06:32.550> know<00:06:32.670> it's<00:06:32.850> and<00:06:33.090> Spotify<00:06:33.570> like

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
and and you know it's and Spotify like

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.990 
and and you know it's and Spotify like
it<00:06:34.050> is<00:06:34.440> a<00:06:34.470> really<00:06:34.800> popular<00:06:35.070> online<00:06:35.580> service

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
it is a really popular online service

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.880 
it is a really popular online service
but<00:06:36.150> it's<00:06:36.300> also<00:06:36.450> not<00:06:36.840> on<00:06:37.080> many<00:06:37.470> of<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.680> others

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
but it's also not on many of the others

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.130 
but it's also not on many of the others
like<00:06:38.190> Google<00:06:39.030> chromecast<00:06:39.330> and<00:06:39.750> Apple<00:06:40.050> they

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
like Google chromecast and Apple they

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.980 
like Google chromecast and Apple they
don't<00:06:40.290> have<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.560> yet<00:06:40.710> um<00:06:41.160> but<00:06:41.970> for<00:06:42.780> the<00:06:42.870> most

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
don't have it yet um but for the most

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.390 
don't have it yet um but for the most
part<00:06:43.230> it<00:06:43.380> seems<00:06:43.590> like<00:06:43.710> Amazon<00:06:44.070> did

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
part it seems like Amazon did

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.640 
part it seems like Amazon did
most<00:06:45.180> of<00:06:45.389> what<00:06:45.570> it<00:06:45.690> needed<00:06:45.930> to<00:06:46.169> in<00:06:46.320> terms<00:06:46.470> of

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
most of what it needed to in terms of

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.460 
most of what it needed to in terms of
content<00:06:47.190> on<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:48.330> price<00:06:48.600> point<00:06:48.630> like<00:06:49.080> seems

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
content on the price point like seems

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.780 
content on the price point like seems
like<00:06:49.680> really<00:06:49.800> good<00:06:50.070> it's<00:06:50.340> obviously<00:06:50.699> very

competitive<00:06:51.419> with<00:06:51.479> Apple<00:06:52.020> um<00:06:52.850> but<00:06:53.850> yeah<00:06:54.060> it'll

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
competitive with Apple um but yeah it'll

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.670 
competitive with Apple um but yeah it'll
be<00:06:54.360> interesting<00:06:54.539> to<00:06:54.780> see<00:06:54.930> you<00:06:54.960> know<00:06:55.080> if<00:06:55.350> people
