00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 It is always one in every country 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.830
 challenge the production in the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 instant, of course, due to the new 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 Of course, everyone is very happy 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.349
 it is always engaged 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 challenge because then production 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.099
 the suppliers are running high 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.420
 and at the same time here in sum 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.430
 have high volume because we 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 at the same time a high load with x5 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.260
 colors with x3 so here is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 good pressure in the boiler, I would 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.170
 say 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 exciting and it looks quite good as 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.000
 The employees do their excellent job 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 job 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 on the one hand, the three themes on the one hand 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.630
 market growth the usa what we saw 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.640
 We have further potential there 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.670
 have and second very important reason 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.219
 was the theme of natural hedge in the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 Independence, so to speak, from the us 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.160
 euro exchange rate because a production in 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.989
 usa and of course that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 Opportunity gives value in dollars 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.110
 to generate and the third was that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.050
 We believed the brand will be here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.180
 also develop and the suv market 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 the usa was the home, so to speak 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 server and we thought of that when you did 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.149
 start a production here in usa then 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.340
 We will become the brand and bmw group 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.170
 First of all, it was quite developing 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.850
 very important that every employee here 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 in this work as in Germany the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 Top priority on quality has quality 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 and productivity we have here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 Of course, you also need to invest more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.390
 still in education because 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.540
 I do not like so many in Germany 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 qualified graduates find out in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 as is the teaching of high three-year-olds 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 so far you can learn from 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.460
 both sides well 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.250
 the americans are very flexible, the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.979
 are very positive that are very 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 what concerns the subject in 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.640
 Germany and we have on both 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 development is very much on the side 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 is centrally located in germany in research 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 engineers center and goes naturally 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.170
 then with the series start in here 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.759
 but there is a small part of that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.679
 course care here in 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.840
 this work because of course if in 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.549
 Munich people sleep in the night 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.869
 then there can still be production here 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.549
 run and then one has to be fast too 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.079
 That's why there is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.850
 always a small defense attendant 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.350
 development team here, too 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.959
 The Sparsburg also for local 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 releases from suppliers because we yes 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.380
 then here in us not just with the x3 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 or x5 grow 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.479
 We are growing with three films 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.380
 was with seven products and that leads 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.239
 of course, to a higher one 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.280
 utilization of the plants in Germany because 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.880
 the brand in sum a positive 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.880
 momentum of
