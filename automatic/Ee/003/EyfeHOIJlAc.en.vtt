00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
but it has a couple of things that you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.430 
but it has a couple of things that you
don't<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.489> lot<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.940> Windows<00:00:36.270> 8<00:00:36.390> tablets<00:00:37.350> are

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
don't see a lot on Windows 8 tablets are

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.160 
don't see a lot on Windows 8 tablets are
really<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.190> tablets<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> general<00:00:38.910> these<00:00:39.059> days

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
really on tablets in general these days

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
really on tablets in general these days
including<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.890> side<00:00:41.100> there's<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.430> optical

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
including on the side there's an optical

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
including on the side there's an optical
sensor<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.600> use<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> control<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
sensor which you can use to control a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.630 
sensor which you can use to control a
mouse<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.329> cursor<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.590> sure<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> actually

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
mouse or a cursor so sure you actually

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
mouse or a cursor so sure you actually
see<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> happening<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> all<00:00:49.350> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
see it's happening there and all I'm

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
see it's happening there and all I'm
doing<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.680> moving<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:50.070> finger<00:00:50.640> over<00:00:50.850> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
doing is moving my finger over this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
doing is moving my finger over this
optical<00:00:51.449> sensor<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.800> almost<00:00:53.190> feels<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
optical sensor which almost feels like a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
optical sensor which almost feels like a
physical<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.449> push<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
physical of you push down on it but you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
physical of you push down on it but you
don't<00:00:55.469> need<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.070> move<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
don't need to you just move it like it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
don't need to you just move it like it
you<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> trackpad<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you would over a trackpad and then on

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.299 
you would over a trackpad and then on
the<00:00:59.250> other<00:00:59.280> side<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> device<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.660> have

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
the other side of the device you have

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
the other side of the device you have
the<00:01:02.309> left<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> right<00:01:02.760> buttons<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.690> clicking

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the left and right buttons for clicking

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
the left and right buttons for clicking
so<00:01:04.559> basically<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> hold<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> two

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so basically you can hold it in two

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
so basically you can hold it in two
hands<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:07.400> we're<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:11.159> can

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
hands as we're about to see and you can

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
hands as we're about to see and you can
put<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.549> hand<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.720> move<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
put one hand on on the side move it and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
put one hand on on the side move it and
then<00:01:13.590> click<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.189> hand<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
then click with the other hand so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
then click with the other hand so
complete<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.920> click

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
complete it down on this one I can click

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
complete it down on this one I can click
down<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> why<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> pushes<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.210> ya<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.810> I'm
