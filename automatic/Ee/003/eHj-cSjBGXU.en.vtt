00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 you google 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.890
 well red sloupk company 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.900
 represents a tank that is not exactly 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 will be ashamed of the thickness of its trunk 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.330
 in front of others st10 tank commander 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.330
 turret to its size broke the record 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.640
 absolute champion in this discipline 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.940
 t110 e5 please love and favor 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.590
 mx 30 b is actually a leopard but not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 Scorch that you know a b g in general 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.879
 will cease to introduce into the game new tanks and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 so mx 30b 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.810
 safety margin of this fruit of love 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.830
 french engineers to german 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.110
 1900 hp technologies 50 less than 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.650
 leopard weight thirty five and a half 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 tons to 4 tons less than the leopard 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.300
 radius of 410 meters is the same as 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 leopard dynamics 720 horses 65 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.680
 kilometers per hour and forty eight degrees 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 per second can't deny myself 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.970
 pleasure to compare with the leopard 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.240
 the maximum speed of the tanks is the same as 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 power density of 20 horses per ton 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 Frenchman engine less powerful but not 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.530
 we forget that our hero is 4 tons 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.020
 easier now go to the gun and she 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.149
 what is the same as leopard 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 for some reason I am not surprised all the difference 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.899
 is that french cannon 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.420
 one tenth of a second longer 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.910
 Charges and two tenths longer 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.649
 come down well and break through too little 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.899
 worse but otherwise 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.690
 one to one and this is good news 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.360
 because the leopard cannons are one of the best in the game 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.789
 is it worth saying that armor after 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.209
 the phrase that the tower is 30b cardboard and 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.250
 leopard towers think not therefore yet 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.550
 Enjoy a second tsiferkami on 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.080
 screen and go to the choice of equipment 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.209
 in my opinion is best suited 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 standard set for medium tank 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.220
 rammer clear and stabilizer 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.560
 rammer will add us chances in dealing with 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.900
 more rapid Soviet with t and 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 enlightened to with stabilizer serve 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.370
 not a bad bonus to our already 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.830
 the strengths of perks on your screen 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.489
 I propose to get a portion of buzz from 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.489
 speakers and gun mxt 30b 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.489
 go 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.879
 on 5 5 and 5 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.709
 as you most likely noticed by the first 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.930
 parts of the video I could not decide 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.329
 with your opinion about our hero 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.060
 on the one hand, I'm not at all glad that this 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.849
 another copy of the leopard 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.269
 because there is still a STB-1 well, that though 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.360
 tower strong and mx 30 b has absolutely 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.970
 the same strong and the same weak 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.709
 hand that and the leopard seems to me that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.530
 repeats the story of the Soviet 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.260
 tenths of which are novice players 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.299
 probably already confused let's 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.920
 Just a second remember the game is what it is 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.560
 was a couple of years ago 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.200
 German tanks were accurate and possessed 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.079
 Americans were famous for their strong armor 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.019
 veins and dp moms Soviet tanks were 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.870
 universal and the French had drums 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.389
 what do you have now tips on 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.879
 tenth level 3 identical with t y 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.620
 Americans have drum tanks like 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.510
 the Germans who even got 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.950
 a branch of cardboard Fri-sau and now mx 30b 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.560
 violating the tradition of the French have 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.199
 drum on the tenth level let's something 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.199
 a copy of the leopard is introduced in every nation 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.460
 let be 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.740
 you forgive that review mx and I 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.930
 turned into some kind of analytics of change 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.860
 occurring in the game but as they say 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.040
 boiling hot 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.960
 now let's go back to 30b and here 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.720
 I just can not say that the tank 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.300
 turned out bad in him absolutely happy 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.300
 all amazing dynamics are phenomenal 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.850
 mx gun has all the qualities for 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.400
 which we swing because of which we love 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.620
 medium tanks Frenchman offers us 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 true gameplay of variability and 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.970
 lack of armor does not mean at all 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.800
 what we have to register in the bushes 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.290
 and climb out of them only to finish 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.910
 Art at the end of the battle, remember what 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.400
 you play more aggressively 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.800
 the greater your chance of winning gets 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.960
 command but if you turn on the blind 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.010
 rage and rush to attack the maximum 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.590
 what will you achieve 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.080
 it will light a couple of opponents a 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.020
 then go to the aggressive hangar 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.960
 the game does not exclude calculation is not analysis 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.080
 situations moreover they are necessary when 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.630
 you play a cardboard tank amx 30 b 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.880
 extreme skill dependent tank and he 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.400
 definitely not suitable for beginners 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.200
 a player but it's hard to imagine what else 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.300
 medium tank can also be good 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.300
 show yourself in the hands of an experienced tanker 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.420
 as a conclusion I want again 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.550
 return gameplay mx deny i'm not in 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.770
 In no case do I exclude the possibility that the Frenchman 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.690
 can perfectly show himself as a sniper 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.490
 playing in the second third line 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.280
 but to fully reveal it 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.290
 potential need to move a platoon 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.170
 fly prague to the rear and create on the battlefield 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.110
 real madness and only then you 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.720
 understand how beautiful mx 30b 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.150
 if you like the video rate it 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.070
 like and subscribe to the channel if you 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.070
