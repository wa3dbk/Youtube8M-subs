welcome<00:00:06.299> someone<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.720> some<00:00:06.839> games<00:00:07.080> I'm<00:00:07.440> Rob

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
welcome someone on some games I'm Rob

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.870 
welcome someone on some games I'm Rob
this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.420> Bowser's<00:00:09.960> Castle<00:00:09.990> racetrack<00:00:10.950> and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
this is a Bowser's Castle racetrack and

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.209 
this is a Bowser's Castle racetrack and
now<00:00:12.269> I'll<00:00:12.599> say<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.049> doesn't<00:00:13.230> work<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
now I'll say it doesn't work the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.849 
now I'll say it doesn't work the
racetrack<00:00:14.549> doesn't<00:00:14.790> work<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.120> did<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.289> had<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
racetrack doesn't work I did I had the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
racetrack doesn't work I did I had the
entire<00:00:17.130> road<00:00:17.369> connected<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.630> see

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
entire road connected but as you can see

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.029 
entire road connected but as you can see
in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> distance<00:00:19.140> there<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> right

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
in the distance there like the right

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.150 
in the distance there like the right
angles<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:21.390> caused<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.439> track<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.010> work

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
angles they caused the track not to work

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
angles they caused the track not to work
I<00:00:23.369> guess<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> need<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.199> have

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I guess you need to have when you have

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.689 
I guess you need to have when you have
an<00:00:25.350> intersection<00:00:25.800> piece<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.550> need

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
an intersection piece like that you need

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.570 
an intersection piece like that you need
to<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.689> road<00:00:27.930> go<00:00:28.230> from<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.859> end<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
to have the road go from one end to the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.800 
to have the road go from one end to the
opposite<00:00:29.970> end<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.630> right

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
opposite end you kind of have right

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.459 
opposite end you kind of have right
angles<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:32.130> made<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.200> connected<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> all

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
angles so I made it connected and all

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.639 
angles so I made it connected and all
nicely<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.160> stuff<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> didn't<00:00:36.660> work<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
nicely and stuff but it didn't work so I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130 
nicely and stuff but it didn't work so I
chopped<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> made<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.390> exact<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
chopped it up and made it more exact and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
chopped it up and made it more exact and
so<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> could<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.010> away<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so because I could get away with that so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.040 
so because I could get away with that so
now<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> friendly<00:00:42.930> race

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now it's just like a friendly race

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
now it's just like a friendly race
between<00:00:43.290> friends<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.090> these

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
between friends so we can have all these

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
between friends so we can have all these
splits<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> stuff<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.170> making<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
splits and stuff now I'm making the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790 
splits and stuff now I'm making the
exact<00:00:47.039> replica<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:49.170> near<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> original

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
exact replica of the near the original

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.119 
exact replica of the near the original
Bowser's<00:00:50.399> Castle<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.920> very

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
Bowser's Castle so this is it it's very

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
Bowser's Castle so this is it it's very
nice<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> will<00:00:54.690> say<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> lava<00:00:55.230> took<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
nice and now I will say the lava took a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
nice and now I will say the lava took a
very<00:00:55.770> long<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.570> am<00:00:57.570> i<00:00:57.719> gaining<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.260> crash

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
very long time am i gaining just crash

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
very long time am i gaining just crash
before<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.219> toy<00:00:59.399> box<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> full<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
before the toy box is full I think it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
before the toy box is full I think it
struggled<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.289> live<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.739> die<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> crash

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
struggled we all live or die in a crash

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
struggled we all live or die in a crash
you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.480> object<00:01:03.930> generated<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.860> my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you know my object generated what my

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.800 
you know my object generated what my
vehicle<00:01:05.339> weapons<00:01:05.640> aren't<00:01:05.880> connected<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
vehicle weapons aren't connected so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.120 
vehicle weapons aren't connected so
they're<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.049> popping<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.500> they're<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.860> but

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they're not popping up they're there but

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.920 
they're not popping up they're there but
they're<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.280> popping<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.090> can't<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.810> well

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they're not popping up I can't be well

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.800 
they're not popping up I can't be well
connecting<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.470> again<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.670> always<00:01:12.270> say<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> use

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
connecting them again I always say I use

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
connecting them again I always say I use
the<00:01:12.990> Pirates<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> Caribbean<00:01:13.530> racetrack

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the Pirates of Caribbean racetrack

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
the Pirates of Caribbean racetrack
pieces<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> theme<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.560> look

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
pieces like the theme for them they look

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
pieces like the theme for them they look
good<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.970> soon<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> racetrack

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
good but as soon as the racetrack

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
good but as soon as the racetrack
doesn't<00:01:19.080> actually<00:01:19.290> work<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
doesn't actually work like it's just

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 
doesn't actually work like it's just
more<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> fun<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.070> race<00:01:23.070> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
more of like a fun little race your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
more of like a fun little race your
friends<00:01:23.820> no<00:01:24.450> real<00:01:24.840> serious<00:01:25.229> racing<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
friends no real serious racing going on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
friends no real serious racing going on
here<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.310> muck<00:01:26.520> around<00:01:27.049> you<00:01:28.049> could

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
here it's just muck around you could

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
here it's just muck around you could
probably<00:01:28.729> instead<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> having<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> racetrack

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
probably instead of having the racetrack

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
probably instead of having the racetrack
pieces<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> section<00:01:32.490> where

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pieces because there's a section where

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.880 
pieces because there's a section where
it<00:01:32.790> goes<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.270> track<00:01:33.479> goes<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.930> thin<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it goes the track goes really thin so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590 
it goes the track goes really thin so
the<00:01:35.070> tiles<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:35.970> facing<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> wrong<00:01:36.540> way

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the tiles are facing the wrong way

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.830 
the tiles are facing the wrong way
actually<00:01:37.350> facing<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.630> horizontal<00:01:39.630> rather

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
actually facing like horizontal rather

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.639 
actually facing like horizontal rather
than<00:01:39.960> vertical<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:41.070> ahead<00:01:42.229> yeah<00:01:43.229> well<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
than vertical I go ahead yeah well you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.280 
than vertical I go ahead yeah well you
know<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.920> mean<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.110> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
know what I mean you can so I think you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.450 
know what I mean you can so I think you
could<00:01:46.500> instead<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> doing<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> racetrack

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
could instead of doing the racetrack

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.710 
could instead of doing the racetrack
pieces<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> could<00:01:47.939> actually<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.360> like

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
pieces you could actually put down like

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.149 
pieces you could actually put down like
the<00:01:48.869> tiles<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.729> just<00:01:50.729> choose<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the tiles and just choose like the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
the tiles and just choose like the
castle<00:01:53.640> prints<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> stuff<00:01:54.840> instead<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
castle prints and stuff instead of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.660 
castle prints and stuff instead of
actually<00:01:55.619> having<00:01:55.649> racetrack<00:01:56.159> pieces<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
actually having racetrack pieces you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
actually having racetrack pieces you
should<00:01:56.790> use<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> squares<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:57.960> stuff<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
should use the squares and stuff and you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.819 
should use the squares and stuff and you
can<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.490> nicer<00:02:00.479> looking<00:02:00.829> but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
can make it a little nicer looking but

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.429 
can make it a little nicer looking but
that's<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> racetrack

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
that's up to you I think the racetrack

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's up to you I think the racetrack
looks<00:02:04.649> fine<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.250> yeah<00:02:05.939> this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.149> basically

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
looks fine but yeah this is basically

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.850 
looks fine but yeah this is basically
thousands<00:02:06.899> possible

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
thousands possible

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.139 
thousands possible
don't<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.100> don't<00:02:08.430> touch<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> lever<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
don't get don't touch the lever will you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.540 
don't get don't touch the lever will you
die<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.140> since<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.680> an<00:02:10.800> actual<00:02:11.190> real

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
die and now since this is an actual real

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.000 
die and now since this is an actual real
race<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:11.970> since<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> doesn't<00:02:12.720> actually<00:02:12.810> work

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
race like since it doesn't actually work

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.110 
race like since it doesn't actually work
you<00:02:14.010> could<00:02:14.190> actually<00:02:14.310> cheat<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> guess<00:02:14.940> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you could actually cheat I guess you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.960 
you could actually cheat I guess you
could<00:02:15.270> jump<00:02:15.510> from<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.350> there<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
could jump from here to there like so

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
could jump from here to there like so
and<00:02:18.900> there's<00:02:19.140> those<00:02:19.260> thin<00:02:19.530> pieces<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> was

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
and there's those thin pieces I was

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
and there's those thin pieces I was
talking<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.190> facing<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> wrong<00:02:21.150> way<00:02:21.230> but

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
talking about facing the wrong way but

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.000 
talking about facing the wrong way but
yeah<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.650> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
yeah this is it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:37.820 
yeah this is it
Bowser's<00:02:23.640> Castle<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:24.330> nice<00:02:24.720> little<00:02:24.870> replica

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890
