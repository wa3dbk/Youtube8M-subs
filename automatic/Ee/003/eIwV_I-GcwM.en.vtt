and<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.799> each<00:02:16.010> side<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.430> fairing<00:02:16.730> there's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and on each side of the fairing there's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.770 
and on each side of the fairing there's
three<00:02:17.329> bolts<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.739> need<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.950> remove

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.520 

and<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.290> four<00:02:26.530> millimeter<00:02:28.530> allen

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and that's a four millimeter allen

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.910 
and that's a four millimeter allen
wrench<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.430> he's<00:02:30.550> using<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.680> bike

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
wrench is what he's using and this bike

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.520 
wrench is what he's using and this bike
has<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.209> wind<00:02:34.209> deflectors<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.080> those<00:02:35.290> are

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
has a wind deflectors on it so those are

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.790 
has a wind deflectors on it so those are
actually<00:02:35.680> just<00:02:37.140> used<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.290> hold<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> wind

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
actually just used to hold the wind

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.320 
actually just used to hold the wind
deflectors<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.280> also<00:02:39.520> secure<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> fairing

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
deflectors and also secure the fairing

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.820 
deflectors and also secure the fairing
so<00:02:40.420> we're<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.690> take<00:02:40.870> those<00:02:41.050> off
