00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
critical to you you can just turn that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959 
critical to you you can just turn that
off<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.590> app<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.920> only<00:01:02.129> update<00:01:02.460> when

off and the app will only update when
you<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.719> launch<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:04.920> take<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you actually launch it it will take a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.310 
you actually launch it it will take a
second<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.760> each<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:06.990> much

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
second or two each time but it is much

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.719 
second or two each time but it is much
better<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> maximize<00:01:08.340> your

better if you want to maximize your
battery<00:01:09.240> life<00:01:09.680> location<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> also<00:01:11.070> very

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
battery life location is also very

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700 
battery life location is also very
intensive<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.299> battery<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.590> go

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
intensive on the battery so you can go

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.679 
intensive on the battery so you can go
to<00:01:13.799> settings<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> way
