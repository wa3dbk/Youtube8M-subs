00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.979 
this morning that did not look nice and
there<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:30.819> an<00:03:30.940> all-world<00:03:31.300> expected<00:03:31.840> about

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
there was an all-world expected about

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
there was an all-world expected about
two<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.319> four<00:03:32.470> inches<00:03:32.530> oh

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.940 

well<00:03:45.299> that's<00:03:45.569> two<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.930> four<00:03:46.110> inches<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.709> you

well that's two to four inches that you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.490 
well that's two to four inches that you
can<00:03:47.159> keep<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.659> think<00:03:51.840> for<00:03:51.989> us<00:03:52.079> we<00:03:52.230> supposed

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
can keep but I think for us we supposed

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710 
can keep but I think for us we supposed
to<00:03:52.560> get<00:03:52.680> ours<00:03:52.860> tonight<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:54.060> cold<00:03:54.299> front<00:03:54.390> will

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
to get ours tonight that cold front will

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.470 
to get ours tonight that cold front will
come<00:03:54.930> through<00:03:54.989> again<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.500> think<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:57.180> most<00:03:57.329> of

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
come through again I think for most of

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.160 
come through again I think for most of
the<00:03:57.599> week<00:03:59.090> next<00:04:00.090> week<00:04:00.329> we're<00:04:00.629> always<00:04:00.720> being

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
the week next week we're always being

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.880 
the week next week we're always being
the<00:04:02.090> high<00:04:03.090> 40s<00:04:03.599> low<00:04:03.659> 50s<00:04:03.989> during<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.500> day<00:04:04.650> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
the high 40s low 50s during the day and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.140 
the high 40s low 50s during the day and
I<00:04:04.980> think<00:04:05.099> in<00:04:05.250> 20<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.060> 30<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.480> 90<00:04:07.849> but<00:04:08.849> hopefully

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
I think in 20 and 30 to 90 but hopefully

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.959 
I think in 20 and 30 to 90 but hopefully
that<00:04:09.480> will<00:04:09.569> be<00:04:09.659> short-lived
