00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.069
 at present the world of 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.049
 videogames is incredibly vast 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.730
 we can find good entertainment 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.639
 anywhere at very low prices 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.129
 accessible and even free that's why 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.949
 that buy metal and 5 rounds and rolls is 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.500
 totally a luxury I would not pay nor 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.900
 five dollars for the gta 5 because I do not 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.999
 they like the gta or the saints but not 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.689
 I say that if someone sold it 60 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.429
 dollars be unfair because that person 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.640
 appreciate the value of that game whatever 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.430
 be the reason metal and round serves is without 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
 doubt some luxury a luxury that are 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.780
 willing to pay only people 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.300
 who loves to die the saga of metal gear 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.220
 solid 'and are so impatient as to 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.470
 do not let wait the time to leave 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.720
 metal gear phantom pain that will be a 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.080
 complete game in every question a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.700
 difference of this which is a version 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.610
 extremely short of an experience that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.650
 will leave you wanting more always 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.200
 I said that a game has to have the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.960
 exact duration to leave you happy already 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.060
 be 10 minutes or 100 hours a 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.920
 video game has to leave you satisfied 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.680
 the time you decide to invest 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.750
 this game unfortunately does not leave that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.119
 particular impression because the game 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.640
 it's so incredibly cool that 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.040
 you just want to play more and more 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.680
 you want more content you want more 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.770
 story you want more missions you want 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.990
 more and more is a game that I believe 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.549
 I even have to describe more because 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.649
 those who do not like metal jr 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.930
 they do not really have to buy it anymore 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.270
 that if they like and buy it and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.009
 we finish it so I can only 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.130
 comment on general things that I 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.080
 they loved what I played on playstation3 and it's 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 totally amazing in the section 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.799
 graphic if you notice that it is a version 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.080
 cut out of a new console 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.390
 generation but still has several 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.130
 incredible effects for the console the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.140
 gameplay is definitely an evolution 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.840
 natural to what had been seen in metal 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.450
 and in every respect they are the controls 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.149
 more comfortable that I've played in the saga and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.979
 the most enjoyable gameplay I 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.170
 loved the load functionality 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.450
 enemies and especially the mechanics of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.680
 run that no doubt was missing 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.329
 metal jr 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.370
 I think the biggest evolution in gameplay 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.409
 are the contacts of the radio 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.900
 that now they do not interrupt the gameplay 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.940
 but they are quite useful as well 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.280
 that appear just when you need them 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.319
 or you get used to asking for them when they are 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.849
 necessary that I can say of the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.849
 history and direction 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.280
 kojima has created a universe from which 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.560
 I can escape and vctor is my 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.750
 favorite character of all metal jr 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 so every moment I enjoy it at 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.730
 maximum the end of the game no doubt I 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.069
 leaves thoughtful and excited to the point of 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.890
 that I started playing metal gear again 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.109
 peace walker which by the way is made 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.870
 more important than ever in metal gear 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.569
 thanks to this game the voice acting 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 as always it is magnificent indeed not 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.099
 I had problems adapting to the new 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.560
 beatbox voice and I would love it in a 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.530
 future see this voice see beatbox speaking 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.109
 with snake and his already iconic voice of deivid 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.489
 hater which is undoubtedly the best voice 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.220
 metal jr 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.349
 the gameplay is great without a doubt 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.299
 as soon as the main mission is finished 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.310
 immediately after I started playing 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.290
 the four most missions that this has 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.620
 game though if you feel something 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.440
 locked in to play 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.060
 space but the gameplay is great and there 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.709
 a lot to play if you really want 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.239
 invest the time everything has 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.819
 thought the kojima team for 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.580
 improve me workshop has worked without a doubt 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.980
 some metal gear feels cooler 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.290
 that I will never refer to the game as 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.360
 a demo for the simple fact that this 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.730
 mission is not confirmed to be 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.980
 will repeat in phantom pain that would be the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.650
 only correct way to call it a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.930
 demo I do not know where many people are from 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.989
 got the idea that a demo means 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.910
 little content or short duration instead 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.410
 of a demonstration of the content that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 will be included in the final material 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.000
 maybe at some point they will end 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.640
 calling tetris the biggest issue of the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.609
 history under this concept according to them 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.280
 my final verdict is that I do not recommend 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.500
 to metal gear rounds and rolls not because 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.989
 I think it 's short that it's expensive or that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.150
 not worth no reason 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.250
 I do not recommend a ground silver because 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.199
 If you're a fan of metal gear, you're going to 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.750
 be so frustrated of just having 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.380
 had a taste of something so cool 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.700
 and excellent that you're going to have nightmares 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.340
 waiting for a fan to come out 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.830
 it's an impotence that even with all the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.920
 money of the world you can give it resolution 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.380
 it's a feeling that I do not wish anyone 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.840
 since at this moment more than ever 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.300
 I'm dying of despair for 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.660
 have a phantom pain in my hands 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.340
 hideo kojima you have made me a disgusting 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.340
 drug addict is something I'm not 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.370
 sure if it 's good to be proud of you 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.120
 I give my money regardless of the amount and 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.610
 I also smile at you for that maleficent genius 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.740
 bastard I can not hate the subject 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.420
 always try to do new things and 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.300
 improve something with what I can 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.580
 relate and also appreciate quite a 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.280
 those who do not like metal and this game 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.840
 It will be very expensive for them although it is a 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.990
 game that can surprise you 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.720
 and for fans of metal gear is a 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.790
 game that is worth every penny and that we 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 suggests that the future of metalships 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.920
 it can not be brighter
