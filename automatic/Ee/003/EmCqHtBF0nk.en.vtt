00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.799
 so 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.120
 welcome to the last tutorial for the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.040
 Mayan program 2012 3d 3d facilitated 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.600
 dotcom today we are going to learn 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.210
 how to create a project in majer ya 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 As auto save the scenes when 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 start creating projects a little more 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.830
 complexes within maya so that you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.930
 you want to do so in very models 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.870
 detailed that you want to use images 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.290
 of reference and images as textures 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.230
 maps in turn you want to render your 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.760
 model and even encourage your model is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.909
 you need to keep all your files 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 well organized then in this 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.210
 tutorial we are going to learn to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 how to create a project within maya 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 so that you can keep all 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.680
 the files organized so that the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.960
 you can share and even move now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 you want and here I have an extra they were 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.970
 let's imagine what they were like 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.379
 working with this model during 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.640
 weeks 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.070
 let's imagine that it is also textured 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.300
 let's save it file 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.300
 project windows 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.200
 and here I open a window to create 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.509
 my project and it should be noted that in other 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.840
 versions of maya closes a way 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.670
 a little different if if you have 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.810
 a version before May 2012 and you 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.840
 you go to fair projects in you to create a 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.010
 new project in this case here we are going to 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 be of favorites let's name it 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:48.160
 and expect a low 3 of facilitated with three 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 of is easy I can change the place 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.990
 where my folder is going to be stored 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.950
 for example I think it is already 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.920
 go project and be when not 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.630
 another great change three versions of maya 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.960
 is that he is dividing my folders 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 in primary and secondary 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.860
 and the primary folders are going to be 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.540
 what we will usually be 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.240
 using as scenes images of 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.020
 reference is a place to save 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.030
 our samples our renders 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.930
 particles sounds clips scripts 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.209
 etc. I can change in the names 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.880
 and even where they are going to water where they go 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.830
 to be saved but well this this 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 we can leave it like this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.260
 secondary project location is 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.780
 selling as something more advanced we have 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.890
 for example trip in hyper texts 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.320
 reimagines shaders maya moore and a great 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.880
 amount of things not if I want 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.850
 use them because I just put it in 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.000
 edit and changed the direction in which I 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.709
 I want you to be 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.950
 we are using that are translator data 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.440
 cheap locations and custom what is 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.600
 simply 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.860
 I want to keep this primary school and 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.410
 project that they are going to give you access 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.790
 It was already created in my project to save it 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.739
 and see how automatically 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 my project went to wait for language 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.180
 with three of facilitated scenes 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.280
 and then let's give spheres 3 of 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.280
 easy 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.960
 let's create a new scene 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.260
 and note that if I give you here to open a 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.530
 scene automatically goes to the project 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.260
 previous I had and scenes then 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.819
 let's open this is ok 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.769
 same if I want to address mesh yet 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.420
 to a project folder or wifi it 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.420
 projected and I choose the folder 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.000
 and also be if we are 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.130
 working then on this project 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.650
 complex not or sometimes even in 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.970
 projects because a little basic is going to 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
 tend to close and if you have not saved 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.550
 your project you then scene you're going to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.040
 put all the work done then 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.770
 for that Maya gives us a choice of 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.530
 auto save 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.900
 let's go to windows 7 and preferences 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.949
 preferences 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.639
 and let's fine projects is the section 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.300
 of auto border 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.710
 let's give it enable to enable and 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.840
 here we will be able to modify the 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.520
 time interval that we want in the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.770
 that our project is 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.599
 saving let's give it eight minutes 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.880
 because then I 'm working on my 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.950
 masterpiece suppose save 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.870
 and this way I will not talk 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.200
 Well, a great pity to lose all my 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.400
 files and it's going to be saving 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.340
 it is automatically important to tell you 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.600
 that throughout the maya tutorials 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.400
 no sight occasions sharing 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620
 that the folders of the projects that 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.750
 we will be creating for 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.880
 that if you can be then checking is 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.880
 of all reference images 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.060
 both renders the scenes that I've 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.770
 created etcetera then this would be all for 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.050
 this mural I hope you have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.420
 enjoyed and agreed has brought to you 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.110
 once in 3d I facilitate dotcom I wait in the 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.110
 next tutorial
