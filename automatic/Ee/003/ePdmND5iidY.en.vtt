00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
yourself here look at the wall of this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.799 
yourself here look at the wall of this
building<00:00:51.110> between<00:00:52.110> those<00:00:52.379> two<00:00:52.860> lines<00:00:53.190> like

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
building between those two lines like

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.260 
building between those two lines like
this<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.289> throw<00:00:56.629> basically<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.170> see

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
this and throw basically as you can see

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:10.520 
this and throw basically as you can see
the<00:01:00.270> smoke<00:01:00.570> goes<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.930> won't<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the smoke goes here so you won't have to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.780 
the smoke goes here so you won't have to
check<00:01:11.010> short<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.110> before<00:01:13.110> rotating<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:14.010> hey

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
check short and before rotating from hey

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.960 
check short and before rotating from hey
like<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.340> will<00:01:17.340> won't<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.299> able<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.689> peek<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
like this will won't be able to peek you

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
like this will won't be able to peek you
same<00:01:20.970> goes<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.570> people<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.020> come<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
same goes for the people can come here

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
same goes for the people can come here
and<00:01:23.210> basically<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.750> smoke<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:26.360> like<00:01:27.360> as

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and basically the smoke is not like as

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
and basically the smoke is not like as
much<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.110> use<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:30.110> kulbir<00:01:31.110> something

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
much to use for kulbir something

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.300 
much to use for kulbir something
actually<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.360> moved<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.900> check<00:01:34.470> something

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
actually is as moved to check something

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.050 
actually is as moved to check something
less<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.990> rush<00:01:37.290> side<00:01:37.790> like<00:01:38.790> for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
less because when you rush side like for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.469 
less because when you rush side like for
example<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:40.049> B<00:01:40.229> side<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
example the B side you will have to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.360 
example the B side you will have to
check<00:01:42.750> yeah

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
check yeah

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.520 
check yeah
site<00:01:45.090> itself<00:01:45.810> inferno<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.900> so<00:01:48.900> if<00:01:49.230> you<00:01:49.380> have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
site itself inferno and so if you have

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.750 
site itself inferno and so if you have
to<00:01:49.710> check<00:01:50.450> rotation<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.660> there<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:52.560> be

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
to check rotation from there it will be

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.090 
to check rotation from there it will be
harder<00:01:54.140> mostly<00:01:55.140> because<00:01:55.380> you're<00:01:55.770> playing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
harder mostly because you're playing

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.000 
harder mostly because you're playing
with<00:01:56.540> random<00:01:57.540> people<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.260> get<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.740> was

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
with random people like get right was

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.360 
with random people like get right was
doing<00:01:59.370> so<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:01.320> better<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.190> have<00:02:02.220> to

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
doing so it's better just to have to

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.470 
doing so it's better just to have to
check<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:03.980> obviously<00:02:04.980> someone<00:02:05.400> can<00:02:05.640> go<00:02:05.850> into

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
check that obviously someone can go into

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.100 
check that obviously someone can go into
this<00:02:06.630> mode<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.200> stay<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.580> still<00:02:09.450> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this mode and stay there but still it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.000 
this mode and stay there but still it's
it's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:11.100> cool<00:02:11.730> smoke<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.240> believe<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.650> hope

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it's a cool smoke I believe so I hope

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.710 
it's a cool smoke I believe so I hope
