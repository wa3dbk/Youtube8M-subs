00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
[LGR Theme]

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.440
[fizz, sip]

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.300
Aahhh!

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.520
Carmageddon is one of those unique
games that you just have to wonder

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.940
how it was created in the first place.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.480
"Racing for the chemically imbalanced,"

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.000
states the rather graphic box art,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.380
right under its blood-splattered logo.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.280
Even Postal 2 didn't have a cover this blatant.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.320
This is the uncensored American release here.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.440
For those of you that may
not have gotten the idea yet,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.880
Carmageddon is about racing cars

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880
while causing all sorts of mayhem

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.060
in a somewhat armageddon-like fashion.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.300
And holy crap, this game is fun!

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.500
Carmageddon is not to be confused

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.720
with the very much horrible Carmageddon 64.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.620
This one is amazing

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.560
and it was made by SCI,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.160
who later released games under the Eidos brand

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.300
and is now owned by Square Enix.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.300
To get a general idea of the game's feel,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.860
think about a mashup of demolition derbies

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.560
and movies like Mad Max and Death Race 2000.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.000
And actually, that's more accurate
than you might think at first.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.360
The game started off as a
demolition racing game concept.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.940
The idea was scrapped and it was reworked

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.580
once they got a license to the movie Mad Max.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.560
But that license fell through
and instead was replaced

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.760
with a license to the sequel
to the movie Death Race 2000,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.340
Death Race 2020.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.980
But that movie was canned,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.580
so that license fell apart, too.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.800
Eventually they just said,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.280
"Let's get the freaking game done,"

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.140
and they released it as Carmageddon.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.780
You start out as one of two drivers,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.400
Mad Mike or Die Anna,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.700
with Mike having a car

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.900
mainly made for destroying other cars,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.540
and Anna with a car that's better for killing people.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.760
A little more lightweight.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.900
Yeah, that is the main draw of the game:

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.680
being able to slaughter pedestrians for points,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.760
just like the movie Death Race 2000.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.440
In fact, Mad Mike's–

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.280
not to be confused with Mad Max's– car

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.400
is based on the alligator car

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.220
from the movie Death Race 2000.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.800
So you can pick either of these two players.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.580
Each car is good for certain things,
but it really doesn't matter too much.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.540
They're really, really similar as far as specs.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840
The career mode consists of 36 races

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.480
and a couple of dozen vehicles that can be unlocked.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.720
You can also upgrade your cars up to five levels,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.780
and six after you beat the game,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740
with money that you earn for killing
people and killing your opponents.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.140
So you're really free to play how you want to,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.520
no matter what car you pick.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
And I mean that to the fullest.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.060
You

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.860
can play

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.780
Carmageddon

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.260
any way you can think to.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.080
Each race is completed in one of three ways:

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.540
by destroying your opponents demolition derby-style,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.380
by killing all of the pedestrians,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.180
or by completing the race circuit.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.320
Nobody ever really completes the actual racing circuits

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.700
because they're for pansies.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.520
So personally, I'd go for blowing up my opponents,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.640
as there are sometimes up to 700 pedestrians to kill.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.020
So that could take forever.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.540
And the racing takes place in
rather large open world areas.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.820
Finding all these pedestrians can
be hard to do without a power-up.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.540
Really, a nice mix of things is the way to go.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.360
Mow over a few dozen people
and animals, or even better,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.620
run over the people AND your
opponents in one felled swoop.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.700
Preferably by electrocuting them.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660
And then landing on them from a high jump

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.400
and then running back over
their carcass with your tires,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.260
spreading their guts all over the place,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.920
mixing it with the burning oil of your dead rivals.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.700
Laughing like a maniac

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.920
all along the way!

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.040
[maniacal laugh]

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.760
Of course, you've got to save
a replay of that if it happens,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.860
post it on YouTube,
'cause that would be awesome.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.400
And no, I am not a psycho.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.540
This game...

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.220
just... does horrible things.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.100
And you know what?
That's why I love Carmageddon so much.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.860
It gives you such an intense feeling of freedom

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.620
for playing how YOU want to.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.740
No matter how horrific it is,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.900
and usually the MORE horrific it is, the better.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.720
You get points in cash for no matter what you do,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.260
so you never feel like you're wasting your time, really.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.600
It's just that some things you do
are gonna be a little more satisfying

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600
to your style than other things.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.820
You could go as crazy as you want.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.960
And yes, your car will take serious damage,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.180
but as long as you have some credits to repair your car,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.580
you can do so on the spot.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.120
If you flip over, you can reset your car for 1,000 credits.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.600
I mean, I never feel like I'm being
punished playing Carmageddon.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.420
I always come away from the game feeling satisfied.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.540
Now there are three difficulty modes

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.280
and the hardest difficulty is really challenging.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.380
But if you get bored of simply annihilating everyone,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.120
it's a good way to mix things up.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.380
And if you like a particular race a whole lot,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.600
you can back and play it over
as many times as you like,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.140
still earning more cash and upgrades along the way.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.980
It's the little things like this that
are actually HUGE things missing

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.360
from racing games today,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.800
which is the freedom to follow your own disturbing path

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.540
and still have loads of fun making actual,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.480
discernible game progress.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.440
Sure, the graphics are pretty dated,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.060
but it doesn't make it any less fun.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.280
And when you use the high-res mode or 3dfx patch,

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.860
it's certainly more than playable.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.020
The soundtrack is also very enjoyable
and I think very appropriate,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.740
mostly by Fear Factory,
which was sort of a staple

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.160
of action-racing games in the late '90s.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.480
The sounds are all appropriately nasty too,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.600
with screams and crunchy collisions.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.000
One or two of them are kind of annoying,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.480
like your little guy up at the top of the screen,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.460
shouting obscenities and random things here and there.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.180
You can turn him off, thankfully.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.160
Really annoying, though, are the
cops and the sound they make.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.540
That siren just never stops for the last half of the game.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.660
So that gets old.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.800
The opponent artificial intelligence
is also... very well done,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.120
with each driver having a personal style

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.460
that you'll have to learn in order to defeat them.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.880
Each area you race in feels unique in its own way,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.280
though most of them are just
variations on previous races.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.500
There's only about five or six different track types.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.920
But each one feels different enough.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.520
You'll have some that are dark,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.920
some are in the daytime,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.720
some where it's gonna be foggy or...

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.220
it just looks different enough where it to
make it feel like you're racing somewhere else.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.400
And the controls... wow.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.000
Once you get used to the very solid physics,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.820
it is a joy to drive

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.000
each of the cars.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.000
Every car feels extremely different

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.660
and very appropriate to its shape and mass.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.740
And it's felt in every bump,
jump and head-on collision.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.340
And with this much variation to the cars,
as well as the tracks themselves,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.960
it makes what is already a lot
of gameplay feel like even more.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.780
And if that's still not enough,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.760
there's an expansion, the Splat Pack,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.600
which adds a whole lot more cars and tracks

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.860
and a few tweaks along the way.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.760
And I could go on with more details,
but honestly I really don't care to.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.320
Because Carmageddon is really that good.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.600
No other DOS racing game

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.120
even comes close to this as far as I'm concerned,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.120
as far as raw fun factor.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.500
Now I do still like and prefer the sequel,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.000
Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.280
It's pretty much the exact same game,
but with even more to do.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.160
There's something more intangibly
raw-feeling about the original game.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
It's kind of like Doom in that respect.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.520
Sure, there are more advanced games in the genre,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.520
but this DOS classic

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.920
is just perfect the way it is.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.400
And the end result

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.160
is a timeless feeling that you'll get

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.420
with no other DOS racing game, period.
