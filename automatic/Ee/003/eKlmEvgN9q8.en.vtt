chain tensioner that comes with this kit

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
chain tensioner that comes with this kit
is<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:47.190> absolute<00:00:47.610> piece<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.059> crap<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> got

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
is an absolute piece of crap so I got

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.270 
is an absolute piece of crap so I got
this<00:00:49.440> whole<00:00:49.649> new<00:00:49.829> wheel<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:51.960> that

deuce the hub hub in a sprocket assembly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.219 
deuce the hub hub in a sprocket assembly
I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> was<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.570> pirate<00:01:00.960> cycles<00:01:03.229> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

I think it was from pirate cycles and
it's<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> 40<00:01:04.920> tooth<00:01:07.369> sprocket<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.450> there's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's the 40 tooth sprocket and there's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's the 40 tooth sprocket and there's
my<00:01:09.810> own<00:01:09.960> homemade<00:01:10.500> chain<00:01:10.830> tensioner<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so a couple of little upgrades I made

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.410 
so a couple of little upgrades I made
where<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> NGK<00:01:43.770> spark<00:01:43.799> plug<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.490> I'll

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
where the the NGK spark plug and I'll

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.249 
where the the NGK spark plug and I'll
set<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.720> MSD<00:01:46.290> plug<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> garage<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
set this MSD plug in the garage so I

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.490 
set this MSD plug in the garage so I
swap<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:51.170> upgraded<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
swap that in and upgraded some of the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.219 
swap that in and upgraded some of the
hardware<00:01:53.090> here<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> side<00:01:54.570> covers<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.079> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
hardware here on the side covers not all

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.249 
hardware here on the side covers not all
of<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> intake

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
of it but a lot of it here at the intake

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
of it but a lot of it here at the intake
and<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> exhaust<00:01:59.820> cover<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> studs

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and at the exhaust cover of the studs

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.459 
and at the exhaust cover of the studs
and<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.649> allen<00:02:02.520> head<00:02:02.700> bolts<00:02:03.479> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
and just just got allen head bolts you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.469 
and just just got allen head bolts you
can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> does<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> boost<00:02:06.090> bottle

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
can see it does have a boost bottle

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.380 
can see it does have a boost bottle
that's<00:02:07.140> another<00:02:07.380> little<00:02:07.530> homemade<00:02:08.390> boost

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that's another little homemade boost

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that's another little homemade boost
bottle<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> believe<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.410> ones

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
bottle I believe that ones

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.180 
bottle I believe that ones
the<00:02:13.220> total<00:02:13.640> volume<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.950> little

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the total volume of that the little

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.880 
the total volume of that the little
bottle<00:02:16.490> plus<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.390> tube<00:02:18.610> believed<00:02:19.610> was<00:02:20.470> 60<00:02:21.470> CC

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
bottle plus the tube believed was 60 CC

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.010 
bottle plus the tube believed was 60 CC
so<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.430> under<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.450> displacement<00:02:23.990> of

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
so it's just under the displacement of

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.050 
so it's just under the displacement of
the<00:02:24.140> engine<00:02:24.170> which<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.770> 66<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.880> see<00:02:29.030> I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the engine which was 66 and you see I

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.180 
the engine which was 66 and you see I
made<00:02:29.330> little<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.900> had<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.830> there<00:02:31.040> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
made little I had to get in there and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.370 
made little I had to get in there and
make<00:02:31.850> some<00:02:32.380> solid<00:02:33.380> mounts<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> little

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
make some solid mounts the little

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.030 
make some solid mounts the little
running<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.500> around<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:38.590> frame<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.800> bike

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
running in around the frame of the bike

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.150 
running in around the frame of the bike
it<00:02:40.640> just<00:02:40.700> allowed<00:02:41.120> too<00:02:41.300> much<00:02:41.480> flex<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it just allowed too much flex and the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160 
it just allowed too much flex and the
engine<00:02:43.460> would<00:02:43.550> always<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.270> would<00:02:44.390> dive<00:02:44.690> over

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
engine would always it would dive over

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.470 
engine would always it would dive over
and<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.640> would<00:02:46.730> throw<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.000> chain<00:02:47.240> line

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
and so that would throw the chain line

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.970 
and so that would throw the chain line
out<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:48.020> whack<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.440> then<00:02:48.530> my<00:02:48.620> chain<00:02:48.860> would

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
out of whack and then my chain would

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.070 
out of whack and then my chain would
bind<00:02:49.220> up<00:02:49.459> or<00:02:49.610> my<00:02:49.700> chain<00:02:49.940> would<00:02:50.090> jump<00:02:50.330> off<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:50.840> I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bind up or my chain would jump off so I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.010 
bind up or my chain would jump off so I
just<00:02:51.709> made<00:02:51.860> some<00:02:52.040> solid<00:02:52.400> mounts<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.810> see

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
just made some solid mounts you see

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.740 
just made some solid mounts you see
there's<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.350> rear<00:02:54.500> one<00:02:55.480> there's<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> front

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
there's the rear one there's the front

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.550 
there's the rear one there's the front
one<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.459> was<00:02:58.550> about<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.380> I'll<00:03:00.380> get

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
one and that was about it and I'll get

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.890 
one and that was about it and I'll get
this<00:03:00.680> thing<00:03:00.740> fired<00:03:01.070> up<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.700> I'll<00:03:02.690> let<00:03:02.810> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
this thing fired up and I'll let you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:26.740 
this thing fired up and I'll let you
hear<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.080> running

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.970 

still<00:03:27.750> haven't<00:03:27.990> been<00:03:28.170> able<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.950> to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
still haven't been able to get it to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.520 
still haven't been able to get it to
idle<00:03:29.340> correctly<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:32.930> anyway<00:03:33.930> I've<00:03:34.410> been

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
idle correctly so anyway I've been

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.290 
idle correctly so anyway I've been
working<00:03:34.800> on<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.220> tell<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> truth<00:03:36.120> I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
working on that and tell you the truth I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.290 
working on that and tell you the truth I
think<00:03:36.390> I'm<00:03:36.540> gonna<00:03:36.630> swap<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.020> out<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.350> put<00:03:37.500> a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
think I'm gonna swap this out and put a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.360 
think I'm gonna swap this out and put a
four-stroke<00:03:39.590> engine<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.710> this<00:03:40.830> little<00:03:41.190> three

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
four-stroke engine in this little three

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.250 
four-stroke engine in this little three
horsepower<00:03:41.640> now<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.720> I've<00:03:42.810> got<00:03:42.990> all<00:03:43.020> this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
horsepower now that I've got all this

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.810 
horsepower now that I've got all this
this<00:03:44.250> whole<00:03:44.460> setup<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.960> this<00:03:46.820> hub

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
this whole setup back here this hub

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.870 
this whole setup back here this hub
adapter<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.330> sprocket<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.460> I'll<00:03:50.460> just<00:03:50.730> get

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
adapter and sprocket and I'll just get

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.940 
adapter and sprocket and I'll just get
like<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.030> three<00:03:51.270> horsepower<00:03:51.950> four-stroke

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
like a three horsepower four-stroke

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.220 
like a three horsepower four-stroke
engine<00:03:53.420> well<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.720> typical<00:03:55.050> clutch

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
engine well this is a typical clutch

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.710 
engine well this is a typical clutch
throw<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.420> see<00:03:57.420> how<00:03:57.570> that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
throw that on there and see how that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.120 
throw that on there and see how that
goes<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.170> all<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.220> all<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:01.680> pretty<00:04:01.770> alright

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
goes but all in all it's pretty alright

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.110 
goes but all in all it's pretty alright
the<00:04:02.250> biggest<00:04:03.350> improvement<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.440> performance

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the biggest improvement in performance

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.780 
the biggest improvement in performance
comes<00:04:06.200> from<00:04:07.200> swapping<00:04:07.590> out<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.610> these

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
comes from swapping out to one of these

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.410 
comes from swapping out to one of these
NGK<00:04:09.330> plugs<00:04:09.950> everything<00:04:10.950> else<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.310> did<00:04:11.580> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
NGK plugs everything else that I did the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.160 
NGK plugs everything else that I did the
the<00:04:13.230> new<00:04:13.380> wire<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.490> boost<00:04:14.700> bottle<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.660> kind<00:04:15.990> of

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
the new wire the boost bottle it kind of

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.310 
the new wire the boost bottle it kind of
helped<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.280> most<00:04:18.060> noticeable<00:04:18.780> sort<00:04:19.230> of

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
helped but the most noticeable sort of

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.510 
helped but the most noticeable sort of
seat-of-the-pants

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.350 

improvement<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.730> power<00:04:24.440> came<00:04:25.440> from<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.680> plug

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
improvement in power came from this plug

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.450 
improvement in power came from this plug
much<00:04:27.360> easier<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.840> start<00:04:28.140> ran<00:04:28.920> a<00:04:28.950> lot<00:04:29.190> cleaner

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
much easier to start ran a lot cleaner

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.450 
much easier to start ran a lot cleaner
ran<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.790> lot<00:04:30.000> smoother<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.190> got<00:04:32.310> one<00:04:32.430> of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
ran a lot smoother so if you got one of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.880 
ran a lot smoother so if you got one of
these<00:04:32.580> engines<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.510> highly<00:04:34.200> recommend<00:04:34.620> putting

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
these engines I highly recommend putting

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.080 
these engines I highly recommend putting
in<00:04:35.040> one<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.220> these<00:04:35.280> NGK<00:04:36.240> plugs<00:04:37.880> also<00:04:38.880> got<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
in one of these NGK plugs also got the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.680 
in one of these NGK plugs also got the
little<00:04:39.210> o-ring<00:04:39.390> here<00:04:40.070> between<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.690> intake

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
little o-ring here between the intake

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.080 
little o-ring here between the intake
tube<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:44.360> carburetor<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.610> that's<00:04:47.760> it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
tube and the carburetor and so that's it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.440 
tube and the carburetor and so that's it
pretty<00:04:48.720> fun<00:04:48.900> little<00:04:48.930> project<00:04:49.880> but<00:04:50.880> I'm

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
pretty fun little project but I'm

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.610 
pretty fun little project but I'm
probably<00:04:51.600> going<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.900> improve<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.470> little

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
probably going to improve on it a little

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.700 
probably going to improve on it a little
bit<00:04:52.740> more<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.270> I'll<00:04:54.270> keep<00:04:54.390> filming<00:04:54.720> thanks

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
bit more and I'll keep filming thanks

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.100 
bit more and I'll keep filming thanks
for<00:04:55.830> watching
