00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.279
 we will now show the process of production of vine shoots police 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.700
 aunt 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.860
 It's all production of seedlings Police vine Auntie she can be used to 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.369
 any cultivar 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:12.620
 It's Indian, it's going 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.909
 from the American to the fine 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.920
 for the production of a fine 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.739
 police vine had 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.900
 we can 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.679
 make the impacts of these forms in defending those moments 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.810
 we can fix it with a stake from a certain port still without roots 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.059
 that is made annually is made inside a shed so it is called 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.680
 table grafting 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.490
 we can start behaving right 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.590
 already rooted in the previous year 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.060
 or we can do it in seritinga already in a plant 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.080
 not because it was established in the field 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.870
 To make it easier for us, we'll show you. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.780
 in a power stake still the country 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900
 We are going to show you. 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.789
 ect is ripe so far the time is the winter so we go 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.789
 is not a material we have available at the moment 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.980
 so to make it right on the part of a certain port he said in the house that I 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.120
 I participate bankruptcy is not yet bloated 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 We're going to cut this graft port. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.480
 in the north 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.880
 to be a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.070
 an internal long-term make sense 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.150
 once cut then we'll do 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.760
 the gap 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.820
 so let's get a pocket knife we'll do with a cut on naw's face 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.510
 right in the middle 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.590
 and let's fit a wedge 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 which is the penalty part of the plant life that our producer 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.270
 so we took a branch a tutor variety 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.720
 let's cut 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 near the place 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 close to another type we have a parliament 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.200
 containing a gem and we go from these seams will make a cure 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.910
 It is important that the knife is sharp enough to make this wedge because it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.730
 have to cut the fabric and not 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.730
 the carts 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.159
 once this harvest has been 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
 we just fit 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.089
 in the branch 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.729
 in the uncertain part of the room 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:27.769
 once it tries the conock of the fork in the port the fair thus to 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.709
 Next operation is to protect this region of Chianti here with one with the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.499
 Plastic also called lashing the hour batter can be done with any 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.469
 Plastic type ten of these pascoski are rushed beach beach sun 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.569
 wake up cars and other 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.719
 and other foods 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.819
 how plastic sachets plastic sachets there are plastics 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.489
 specific action present also 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.969
 it is found in agricultural lands 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.529
 none of the materials that have been used only very easily 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.239
 application is a common client pvc movie 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.029
 she who housewives or decent work who are partly 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:07.950
 found 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.439
 in supermarkets 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.109
 So to plot, we start marrying. 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.379
 doctor teixeira that made in the bottom part 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.509
 evair the marking of the 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:24.249
 to protect the region of siege contract the entrance of water the entrance of the pac 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.460
 telesales and fumes 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.849
 and also by pixar with a fork 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.439
 in the port a certain 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.439
 when we're tying people near the gem 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.509
 dalma divert money leaves girma 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.109
 without cover 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.589
 and covers well 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.969
 the end of the field 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.029
 so what if 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.719
 this protection 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.459
 do not need to pass 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.469
 many turns because space he has some resistance then 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.699
 some laps is sufficient and as this plastic and high leader does not need 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.179
 of the norm senate simply 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.149
 tears 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.149
 and our uncertainty is ready 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.399
 here we have Maria 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.669
 production says takahashi and vine 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:10.739
 already 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.799
 to about 15 days beach to put to fit 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.579
 is an area already 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.789
 already on a larger scale 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.879
 nor from here will this new seedlings 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.270
 the formation of new leandro vineyards a year be next winter 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.370
 we would have a lot of seedlings ready to be taken 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
 after having seen these main methods of producing seedling 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.759
 vine 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.150
 some tips are important 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.340
 one of them wants 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.750
 without formalities of common grapes both for me and for wine can be 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.370
 quietly produced 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.289
 even by the method here is the 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.210
 whether they are fine grapes for wine promise as detailed cabernet sauvignon 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.380
 cabernet franc 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.180
 the production process 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.220
 What world does it have to be? 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.159
 for filling aunt in function 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.519
 that of sensitivity if materials the occurrence of a pest called 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.830
 flotilla 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.349
 it was against the other 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.040
 Important tip here is that if you buy a vine mode 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.530
 try to buy from one lives this with the 'limit' storyline recorded in the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.520
 Ministry of Culture which has a guarantee of the sanitary quality of samu 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.009
 gives 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.550
 because the vine 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.990
 the screen is attacked by some chemical pests that also attacked others 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.020
 fruit 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.050
 then the person can be taking to his property that amount of people up to 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.159
 the same weight and commercial a plague that will cause 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.440
 We hope that with these tips presented you get 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.639
 produce a good seedling of vine 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.289
 make a good vine reap good fruit 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.289
 to the next 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.889
 because
