00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.770
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.300
 We will consider the mod using 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.600
 which you can create 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.760
 box lockers all sorts of fridge and 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.439
 even safe in the game of minecraft let's 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 look at the first thing which 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.570
 adds this mod 1 from our locker 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.630
 which is unremarkable 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.060
 the only thing is that it opens and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.670
 closes like this 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.390
 have he puts forward these here glass 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.580
 the doors 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.800
 well and so can we put it 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.050
 all sorts of useful things he can not be 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.910
 double which is very sad, but we 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
 proceed to the next handbag 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.829
 is it also a locker which is nothing 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.780
 only differs from this one 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.149
 the only thing is that he has woody ones 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.750
 the doors and we'll proceed to the next 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.640
 little chest 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.230
 it is with us too little chest yes you probably 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.790
 already thought it was some 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.710
 decorative block but in fact it 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.260
 chest he is best suited for 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.760
 any lumberjacks because he 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.550
 best suited just the same for 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.930
 any warehouses well it opens not to 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.300
 the end as you see 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.149
 more or less cool it opens 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.069
 smoothly and it closes smoothly too 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.350
 it also cannot be double 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.560
 let's look to the next thing is this 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.830
 we are also the same locker but this locker 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.170
 how can we say that 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.209
 plug current without plugins for this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.780
 we need such a workbench 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:32.420
 key and lock we open this workbench 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.470
 put this lock in there and enter 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.869
 eg 4433 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.289
 then we all keep this lock 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.979
 we hang on the chest and all we have now 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.739
 as you can see on this 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.039
 little chest lock then we the same 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:55.399
 let's do with the key this power 4433 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.660
 all now with the help of this mod you oh with 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.940
 using this mod with this key 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.750
 you can only open this lock 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 that is, the keys will be the same repeat and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 all right we will open we can also 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.780
 open with your hand but the main thing 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.250

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.470

 in order for these sticks to create us 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.950
 need to make a double fridge 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.260

 all the shelves here are of course very small 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.579
