00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.080 
the hair so I had to try out for
ourselves<00:00:28.340> originally<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.640> gonna<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:30.060> with

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
ourselves originally I was gonna go with

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.950 
ourselves originally I was gonna go with
the<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> ocean<00:00:32.009> wave<00:00:32.189> Bobbi<00:00:32.640> boss<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:33.840> was

the the ocean wave Bobbi boss there was
a<00:00:33.989> little<00:00:34.649> more<00:00:34.829> expensive<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.420> was

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a little more expensive and I was

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990 
a little more expensive and I was
thinking<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.790> so

many different wave patterns I want to
go<00:00:41.219> ahead<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.910> try<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> straight<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.379> way<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
go ahead and try the straight that way I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of have a small head so I'm two packs

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.670 
of have a small head so I'm two packs
was<00:01:03.359> enough<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.690> me<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:05.360> ok<00:01:06.360> let's<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.530> for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
was enough for me but ok let's be for

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
was enough for me but ok let's be for
real<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.010> 18<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.790> ridiculous<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> was

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
real the 18 was just ridiculous it was

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
real the 18 was just ridiculous it was
wrong<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.400> two

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
wrong and then I think because I did two

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
wrong and then I think because I did two
packs<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.240> wasn't<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.810> thick<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.799> might've

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
packs it wasn't as thick as I might've

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
packs it wasn't as thick as I might've
liked<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.530> know

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
liked it to be so I was like you know

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.310 
liked it to be so I was like you know
what<00:01:17.000> not<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.900> ahead<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.200> take

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
what not really I'm go ahead and take

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
what not really I'm go ahead and take
this<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:21.000> didn't<00:01:21.180> even<00:01:21.240> check<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> out

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this out and I didn't even check it out

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
this out and I didn't even check it out
actually<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> went<00:01:22.740> ahead<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> cut<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.610> don't

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
actually I went ahead and cut it I don't

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.960 
actually I went ahead and cut it I don't
know<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> cut<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
know how to cut like that so this is the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
know how to cut like that so this is the
result<00:01:28.520> unevenness<00:01:32.030> ok<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.540> again<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
result unevenness ok so again that's a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.390 
result unevenness ok so again that's a
result<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.159> say<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
result I want to see I want to say I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.660 
result I want to see I want to say I
probably<00:01:39.150> cut<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.979> maybe<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:42.240> 16<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
probably cut it to maybe a 16 so the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
probably cut it to maybe a 16 so the
other<00:01:44.790> 16<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.689> saying<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.020> sort<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> framed

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
other 16 is just saying I sort of framed

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
other 16 is just saying I sort of framed
around<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.100> face<00:01:47.340> did<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> couple<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.149> layers<00:01:48.390> i

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
around my face did a couple of layers i

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.249 
around my face did a couple of layers i
did<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> round<00:01:49.409> head<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.280> i<00:01:50.689> figured<00:01:51.689> i<00:01:51.990> need<00:01:52.170> to
