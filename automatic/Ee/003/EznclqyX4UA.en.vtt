as<00:00:00.240> a<00:00:00.269> medical<00:00:00.719> consultant<00:00:00.870> principally<00:00:01.860> I'm

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
as a medical consultant principally I'm

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.100 
as a medical consultant principally I'm
involved<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:03.149> initial<00:00:03.480> assessment<00:00:03.750> and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
involved in the initial assessment and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.829 
involved in the initial assessment and
diagnosis<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.220> then<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.270> treatment<00:00:06.690> which

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
diagnosis and then the treatment which

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.900 
diagnosis and then the treatment which
you<00:00:06.990> can<00:00:07.140> divide<00:00:07.410> into<00:00:07.680> aspects<00:00:08.550> related<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
you can divide into aspects related to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.089 
you can divide into aspects related to
acute<00:00:09.300> treatment<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.929> management<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.530> then

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
acute treatment and management and then

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.240 
acute treatment and management and then
secondary<00:00:11.550> prevention<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:12.179> think

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
secondary prevention I think

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.890 
secondary prevention I think
historically<00:00:14.250> medics<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> role<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.719> being

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
historically medics have a role as being

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.960 
historically medics have a role as being
leaders<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> multidisciplinary<00:00:16.980> team<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
leaders of the multidisciplinary team I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
leaders of the multidisciplinary team I
think<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.690> certainly<00:00:18.990> some<00:00:19.640> disciplines

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
think there's certainly some disciplines

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.420 
think there's certainly some disciplines
who<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.270> more<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.930> role<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.560> certain<00:00:23.039> times<00:00:23.250> in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
who have more a role at certain times in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
who have more a role at certain times in
the<00:00:23.519> pathway<00:00:23.939> than<00:00:24.119> others<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:25.109> equally<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the pathway than others but equally I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.970 
the pathway than others but equally I
think<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.849> cognizant<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.980> our

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
think we all need to be cognizant of our

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.359 
think we all need to be cognizant of our
role<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.900> times<00:00:31.230> within<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> pathway<00:00:32.130> and

role at all times within the pathway and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090 
role at all times within the pathway and

this at the end of the day you take it
home<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.080> you're<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.590> dangerous

home with you you're on very dangerous

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.030 
home with you you're on very dangerous
territory<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> still<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
territory but you still have to have the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090 
territory but you still have to have the
compassion<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.619> still<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
compassion there and you still have to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
compassion there and you still have to
have<00:01:29.189> some<00:01:29.299> technical<00:01:30.299> ability<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
have some technical ability when it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560 
have some technical ability when it
comes<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.439> what<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.340> those<00:01:33.240> three

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
comes to what we do and those three

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.730 
comes to what we do and those three
things<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.960> actually<00:01:34.229> quite<00:01:34.380> hard<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.680> find

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
things are actually quite hard to find

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.090 
things are actually quite hard to find
in<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.240> person<00:01:36.750> communication<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
in in one person communication is is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.410 
in in one person communication is is
absolutely<00:01:38.939> vital<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.420> area

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
absolutely vital and I think one area

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
absolutely vital and I think one area
that<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.990> sometimes<00:01:43.590> difficult<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.520> most

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that is sometimes difficult is the most

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.219 
that is sometimes difficult is the most
important<00:01:45.210> aspect<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> communication<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
important aspect of communication is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
important aspect of communication is
with<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> patient<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> carer<00:01:47.340> teamwork

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
with the patient and the carer teamwork

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.760 
with the patient and the carer teamwork
is<00:01:48.479> crucial<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.710> think

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
is crucial to what we do and I think

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
is crucial to what we do and I think
anybody<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> professions<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
anybody in any of the professions that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
to what we do and I think that's what

to what we do and I think that's what

makes this work particularly in stroke

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.800 
makes this work particularly in stroke
because<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.550> just<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> group<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.540> people

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
because it just it is a group of people

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.270 
because it just it is a group of people
that<00:02:53.930> are<00:02:53.990> passionate<00:02:54.230> about<00:02:54.470> passionate

that are passionate about passionate
about<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:57.010> over<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.160> time<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.820> built

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
about it and over the time we have built

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.210 
about it and over the time we have built
that<00:02:59.180> team<00:02:59.510> up<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.750> anybody<00:03:00.140> coming<00:03:00.620> new<00:03:00.860> into

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
that team up so anybody coming new into

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.490 
that team up so anybody coming new into
it<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.730> expectation<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.780> there<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
it the expectation is there and the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.770 
it the expectation is there and the

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
standard is already set I think we we

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300 
standard is already set I think we we

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
goals that we're setting are realistic

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.090 
goals that we're setting are realistic
they're<00:03:13.010> appropriately<00:03:13.580> communicated<00:03:14.360> and

they're appropriately communicated and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.100 
they're appropriately communicated and

seems sensible to different teams that
may<00:03:18.350> be<00:03:18.410> taking<00:03:18.950> over<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> achievement<00:03:20.030> of

may be taking over the achievement of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.210 
may be taking over the achievement of
those<00:03:20.300> goals<00:03:20.360> as<00:03:20.989> patients<00:03:21.709> move<00:03:21.860> along<00:03:22.070> the
