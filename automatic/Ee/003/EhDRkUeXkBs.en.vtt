 yeah here it is the big day has arrived 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.170
 so it's true that the pressure is rising 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 for a week 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 there is a big peculiarity it is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.080
 that usually is the race landaise 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.870

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.820
 bullfighting bullfighting it's a show 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 which is particular to me since 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 it's my last and it's true that I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.280
 am I thought to be moved on a lot of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.280
 things I have a lot of friends who are there 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:16.740
 I saw Nicolas doing his despedida 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 who sees there he asked me there is 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 a few months to participate at the start I 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.010
 believe it was at the microphone so I said 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 yes after he asked me on track I 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.070
 still said yes after he told me this is a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 bull I said yes I hope that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.860
 stop there because it will surely not be the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 best performance of my life we ​​have 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 want it to be the best 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 benefit of his life because that's the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.560
 last we want to show under 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.000
 a new day but we are eaten by 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 emotions and others and that's 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 complicated I try to do my best 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.530
 to channel all these emotions and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.790
 that the final output is either correct 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.820
 and that I'm having a good time with the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.820
 public 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.490
 jumps the nicolas key for a last 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.050
 jump and somersaults to let go of the 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.420
 balloon comes out of there I up 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.300
 exhaustion of their and each other a 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.880
 series of jumps until that makes that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.050
 tomorrow neither time nor withdrawal since 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.970
 saint cère square director of the lived 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:14.020
 that she had raised her hand the exit of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:16.030
 nicolas vergonzeanne felt them on 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.800
 its despedida is besides the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.030
 feedback we have from all 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.980
 people who could have crossed the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.360
 evening but who even stayed despite the 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.550
 rain congratulate us for this 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.600
 show we have excellent feedback I 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.940
 think you 're going to spend an evening 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.420
 wonderful 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.800
 I think we 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.959
 we at fence level air and nicolas 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.730
 you can not expect better to celebrate 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.830
 this dida spirit and frankly 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.459
 it's really a very, very big 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.450
 satisfaction I think it was the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.709
 minimum we could do compared 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.090
 at nico's career and I think that's 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.680
 show is the image of his career 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.010
 and that's the best gift we have 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.010
 could do it
