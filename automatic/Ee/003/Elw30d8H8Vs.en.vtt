00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
transparent and here we go I'm just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
transparent and here we go I'm just
gonna<00:01:20.340> crank<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.790> while<00:01:20.970> Joe<00:01:21.149> plays<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.359 

all<00:01:39.619> right<00:01:39.859> and<00:01:40.450> channel<00:01:41.450> B<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.929> set<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.039> as

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
all right and channel B I set it up as

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.520 
all right and channel B I set it up as
kind<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.759> clean<00:01:44.060> boost<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.110> here's<00:01:45.380> what

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
kind of a clean boost and so here's what

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.620 
kind of a clean boost and so here's what
the<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.979> clean<00:01:46.189> sound<00:01:46.429> is<00:01:46.759> like<00:01:47.240> without<00:01:47.450> it

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the the clean sound is like without it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:02:01.569 
the the clean sound is like without it
on<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:52.549> here<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:52.789> go<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.030> it

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.999 

second<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> little

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
second here that you get just a little

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.310 
second here that you get just a little
bit<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> boost<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:07.049> little<00:02:07.079> bit

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
bit of boost out of it I'm a little bit

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.619 
bit of boost out of it I'm a little bit
more<00:02:07.469> grit<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.819> volume<00:02:09.119> jumps<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
more grit and the volume jumps up just a

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.029 
more grit and the volume jumps up just a
little<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.259> we're<00:02:10.739> gonna<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:11.009> through

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
little bit and so we're gonna go through

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.949 
little bit and so we're gonna go through
here<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.430> we're<00:02:11.580> gonna<00:02:11.640> hear<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> same<00:02:12.750> riff

here and we're gonna hear the same riff

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.710 
here and we're gonna hear the same riff
with<00:02:13.170> clean<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> I'll<00:02:15.090> turn<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.360> Channel

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
with clean and then I'll turn on Channel

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.259 
with clean and then I'll turn on Channel
a<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.319> you'll<00:02:17.099> hear<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.940> same<00:02:18.120> roof

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
with grit and then again boosted the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.210 
with grit and then again boosted the
same<00:02:21.239> rift<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.629> we<00:02:21.750> will<00:02:21.900> outro<00:02:22.440> with<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
