00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the dead star on it I don't know if you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.399 
the dead star on it I don't know if you
can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.260> shows<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.500> Death<00:01:13.740> Star

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.760 

it<00:01:20.950> has<00:01:21.420> guns<00:01:22.420> here<00:01:22.780> for<00:01:23.560> each<00:01:23.740> side<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.560> got

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
it has guns here for each side you got

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.050 
it has guns here for each side you got
four<00:01:27.069> turrets<00:01:27.490> here<00:01:27.850> on<00:01:28.119> both<00:01:29.109> sides<00:01:29.819> say<00:01:30.819> that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
four turrets here on both sides say that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.620 
four turrets here on both sides say that
they're<00:01:32.049> got<00:01:32.350> four<00:01:32.819> there<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.189> these<00:01:36.759> engines

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
they're got four there and these engines

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.240 
they're got four there and these engines
I<00:01:37.959> think<00:01:38.530> they're<00:01:38.679> super<00:01:38.979> cool<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:44.250> open

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
I think they're super cool if you open

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.730 
I think they're super cool if you open
their<00:01:45.459> wings<00:01:45.729> there<00:01:46.479> comes<00:01:46.719> a<00:01:47.140> gunner<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:49.740> big

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
their wings there comes a gunner as big

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.669 
their wings there comes a gunner as big
gun<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.299> lakum<00:01:52.299> missiles<00:01:53.789> they<00:01:54.959> look<00:01:55.959> like

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
gun and lakum missiles they look like

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.080 
gun and lakum missiles they look like
pretty<00:01:57.009> far<00:01:58.349> and<00:01:59.349> it<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.129> go<00:02:00.280> from<00:02:00.459> both<00:02:00.700> sides

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
pretty far and it can go from both sides

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
pretty far and it can go from both sides
so<00:02:01.299> if<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.629> close<00:02:01.929> this<00:02:02.140> off<00:02:02.459> turn<00:02:03.459> it<00:02:03.489> around

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
so if you close this off turn it around

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.830 
so if you close this off turn it around
this<00:02:05.110> side<00:02:05.700> comes<00:02:06.700> out<00:02:06.909> on<00:02:07.060> this<00:02:07.209> side<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.750> I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
this side comes out on this side and I

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.089 
this side comes out on this side and I
think<00:02:07.899> that's<00:02:08.259> very<00:02:08.470> cool<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:13.420> has<00:02:13.829> right<00:02:14.829> here

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
think that's very cool it has right here

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.849 
think that's very cool it has right here
it<00:02:15.190> has<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> cockpit<00:02:15.750> with<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> clown<00:02:17.200> pilot<00:02:17.709> in

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
it has a cockpit with a clown pilot in

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.160 
it has a cockpit with a clown pilot in
there<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.239> can<00:02:19.359> see<00:02:19.780> there's<00:02:20.079> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
there in it and as you can see there's a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.420 
there in it and as you can see there's a
image<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.609> another<00:02:22.000> class<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.250> can

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
image of that of another class you can

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.160 
image of that of another class you can
see<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:27.329> back<00:02:28.329> in<00:02:28.829> if<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.010> open<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:31.109> door

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
see that back in if you open this door

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.800 
see that back in if you open this door
get<00:02:32.889> a<00:02:32.920> skateboard<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:34.060> breaks<00:02:34.389> very<00:02:34.540> easily

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
get a skateboard it breaks very easily

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.770 
get a skateboard it breaks very easily
so<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.620> need<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:35.889> be<00:02:35.980> careful<00:02:36.160> with<00:02:36.549> it<00:02:36.700> as<00:02:37.419> one

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I need to be careful with it as one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.430 
so I need to be careful with it as one

bombs instead of five I'll show you what
I<00:03:08.879> did<00:03:10.909> these<00:03:11.909> two<00:03:12.180> things<00:03:12.540> were<00:03:13.019> first<00:03:13.349> like

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
I did these two things were first like

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.289 
I did these two things were first like
this<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> turned<00:03:17.970> them<00:03:18.150> around

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
this like that but I turned them around

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.119 
this like that but I turned them around
so<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:20.459> ml<00:03:21.000> hold<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.569> bigger<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.829> can

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
so that the ml hold is bigger so I can

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:38.449 
so that the ml hold is bigger so I can
fit<00:03:23.519> more<00:03:23.700> bombs<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.859> back<00:03:26.069> in<00:03:37.459> and

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
fit more bombs in it and back in and

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.830 
fit more bombs in it and back in and
then<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.849> put<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.329> wings

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
then you put it in wings

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.830 
then you put it in wings
it<00:03:42.840> slows<00:03:43.319> it<00:03:43.349> back<00:03:43.739> off<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.489> was<00:03:44.840> my

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it slows it back off and that was my

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
it slows it back off and that was my
review<00:03:46.139> for<00:03:46.859> Lego<00:03:46.889> Star<00:03:47.370> Wars<00:03:47.400> freak<00:03:47.819> 909<00:03:48.480> and
