00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 I would like to give you the velos 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.870
 imagine this is the top helmet of bonn 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 carrier 199 euro costs and weighs 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 just over 220 grams, too 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 recently at the tour de france stage victory 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.300
 retracted on the second leg and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 I have many great features 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.689
 would like to explain briefly on the one hand 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.600
 The helmet has been very generously ventilated 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.760
 a micro step adjustable 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.020
 hitmeister two misplace the system 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.100
 of course adjusted in height 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 can be 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.489
 and what makes the helmet special is that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 Form with proband of the pro band is one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 padding that over the whole forehead width 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 go and not fixed to the helmet shell 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.430
 it is only fixed on the outside and feels 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 like a fabric bank on the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.629
 get up on the helmet is worn 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 So very comfortable 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.450
 this is the new marc schuh of 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.330
 Bonn developed a completely new development 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400
 from us the shoe is meant for 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.070
 technical trailer as he people the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.659
 maybe in felix or relatively poor the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.759
 also in technical passages maybe 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.610
 Also here since that was to wear 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.250
 have to dismount the thrust has one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 meeting the isola that is a very 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.930
 soft and non-slip rubber sole and that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.940
 although the pc is as it is one 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.370
 a very sporty shoe of the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.670
 optimum power transmission 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.430
 The shoe has a very strong reinforced 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.080
 10 box so I'm not the ten 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.990
 Stones may do this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.610
 stir up because magath is that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 actually a noise and here too 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.320
 that also means the ship's shoe and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.410
 the foot of course, the shoe comes with 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.760
 a brave and the step by step 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.530
 can be triggered 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.900
 that would always be practical too 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.280
 has tightened and has started 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.619
 then you do not have to go down and go 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 to trigger a step 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.360
 the shoe is also very good 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 the tongue needs ventilation 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 perforated for the best possible 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.930
 ventilation
