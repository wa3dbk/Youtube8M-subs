instructor<00:00:05.710> and<00:00:06.520> I<00:00:06.609> see<00:00:06.759> boats<00:00:07.089> were<00:00:07.359> almost

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
instructor and I see boats were almost

instructor and I see boats were almost
nine<00:00:07.839> years<00:00:08.260> before<00:00:08.559> starting

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.169 

so<00:00:12.170> I'd<00:00:12.470> like<00:00:12.650> to<00:00:12.710> spend

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
so I'd like to spend

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.810

recreational<00:00:52.530> boats<00:00:52.970> they're<00:00:53.970> fairly

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
recreational boats they're fairly

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
recreational boats they're fairly
inexpensive<00:00:54.949> some<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.159> really<00:00:56.309> small

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
inexpensive some of the really small

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.079 
inexpensive some of the really small
boats<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:58.110> one<00:00:58.290> here<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.940> could

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
boats like this one here you could

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.170 
boats like this one here you could
probably<00:01:00.269> find<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.470> 300<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.489> perhaps<00:01:02.820> even

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
probably find for 300 or perhaps even

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.530 
probably find for 300 or perhaps even
less<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.980> so<00:01:04.980> they're<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.760> attractive<00:01:06.030> for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
less and so they're very attractive for

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.930 
less and so they're very attractive for
that<00:01:06.659> reason<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> width<00:01:08.580> they're

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
that reason because of the width they're

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.360 
that reason because of the width they're
pretty<00:01:09.150> stable<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:10.500> design<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.190> hull

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
pretty stable the design of the hull

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.180 
pretty stable the design of the hull
makes<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.150> track<00:01:12.479> reasonably<00:01:13.200> well<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.800> for

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
makes them track reasonably well so for

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.740 
makes them track reasonably well so for
most<00:01:14.280> beginners<00:01:14.520> they're<00:01:15.060> pretty<00:01:15.420> easy<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
most beginners they're pretty easy to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.800 
most beginners they're pretty easy to
paddle<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.580> were<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> capsize<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.690> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
paddle if you were to capsize in one of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.399 
paddle if you were to capsize in one of
these<00:01:18.900> boats<00:01:19.520> half<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> mile<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:21.060> into<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
these boats half a mile out into one of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.609 
these boats half a mile out into one of
the<00:01:22.469> Great<00:01:22.649> Lakes<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.399> into<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.790> ocean

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
the Great Lakes or out into the ocean

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
the Great Lakes or out into the ocean
that<00:01:25.619> would<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.040> dangerous<00:01:26.399> situation

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that would be a very dangerous situation

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
that would be a very dangerous situation
and<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.750> boats<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.229> should<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> used

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and so these boats really should be used

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
and so these boats really should be used
in<00:01:29.340> places<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.659> capsize<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.740> only<00:01:31.890> going

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in places where a capsize is only going

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
in places where a capsize is only going
to<00:01:32.100> mean<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> quick<00:01:32.610> swim<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> shore<00:01:33.320> they

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to mean a quick swim to shore they

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
to mean a quick swim to shore they
really<00:01:34.590> should<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.770> used<00:01:35.100> more<00:01:35.250> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
really should be used more on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.600 
really should be used more on
slow-moving<00:01:36.630> rivers<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.560> small<00:01:37.890> inland

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
slow-moving rivers and small inland

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
slow-moving rivers and small inland
lakes<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> look<00:01:39.930> inside<00:01:40.079> most

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
lakes if you look inside most

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.429 
lakes if you look inside most
recreational<00:01:41.399> kayaks<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.119> minimal

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
recreational kayaks there's minimal

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.370 
recreational kayaks there's minimal
floatation<00:01:43.439> perhaps<00:01:44.070> some<00:01:45.259> chunks<00:01:46.259> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
floatation perhaps some chunks of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.639 
floatation perhaps some chunks of
styrofoam<00:01:47.009> or<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:48.329> some<00:01:48.600> cases<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.229> may<00:01:49.409> have

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
styrofoam or in some cases they may have

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.599 
styrofoam or in some cases they may have
a<00:01:49.680> rear<00:01:50.009> hatch<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.000> provides<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:51.719> buoyancy

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
a rear hatch that provides some buoyancy

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.090 
a rear hatch that provides some buoyancy
but<00:01:53.609> these<00:01:54.450> boats<00:01:54.719> have<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> interior

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.279 
but these boats have a lot of interior
space<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> event<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.539> capsize<00:01:57.750> they

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
space and in the event of a capsize they

are<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> fill<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> water

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
are going to fill up with a lot of water

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.240 
are going to fill up with a lot of water
and<00:02:00.509> by<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> time<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.649> try<00:02:01.859> to<00:02:01.920> climb<00:02:02.189> back

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and by the time you try to climb back

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.870 
and by the time you try to climb back
into<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.869> unlikely<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.490> even

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
into it it's unlikely that you are even

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.399 
into it it's unlikely that you are even
going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.329> able<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.810> back<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
going to be able to get back into it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.389 
going to be able to get back into it
because<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.710> boat<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.100> be<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
because the boat is going to be so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.340 
because the boat is going to be so
unstable<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.420> water<00:02:09.630> sloshing
