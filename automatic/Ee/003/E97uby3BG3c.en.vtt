we're<00:00:02.940> gonna<00:00:03.420> now<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.900> at<00:00:04.050> the<00:00:04.940> subject<00:00:05.940> of

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
we're gonna now look at the subject of

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.030 
we're gonna now look at the subject of
intermediate<00:00:06.779> floors<00:00:07.080> or<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.470> our<00:00:07.620> case<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
intermediate floors or in our case of

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.640 
intermediate floors or in our case of
Denby<00:00:08.370> day<00:00:08.550> or<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.380> first<00:00:10.380> floor

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
Denby day or the first floor

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.490 
Denby day or the first floor
construction<00:00:11.150> we've<00:00:12.150> chosen<00:00:12.480> an<00:00:13.020> i-beam

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
construction we've chosen an i-beam

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.960 
construction we've chosen an i-beam
system<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:15.060> the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.300> of<00:00:15.510> all<00:00:15.650> because<00:00:16.650> of

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
system for the first of all because of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.419 
system for the first of all because of
build<00:00:17.970> ability<00:00:18.769> price<00:00:20.150> speed<00:00:21.949> but<00:00:22.949> mainly

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
build ability price speed but mainly

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.669 
build ability price speed but mainly
because<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> its<00:00:23.909> ability<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> take<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> mvhr

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:25.679 
because of its ability to take the mvhr

millimeter<00:00:29.069> diameter<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.150> also<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
millimeter diameter and also you have to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.950 
millimeter diameter and also you have to
have<00:00:31.259> bends<00:00:31.589> for<00:00:32.250> outlets<00:00:33.060> into<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.720> ceiling

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
have bends for outlets into your ceiling

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.350 
have bends for outlets into your ceiling
and<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.590> forth<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.630> either<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.560> have

right wet plaster is but of course if

right wet plaster is but of course if
you<00:02:33.440> put<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> floor<00:02:33.889> in<00:02:34.069> before<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.430> do<00:02:34.579> the

you put the floor in before we do the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.740 
you put the floor in before we do the
plaster<00:02:35.209> you've<00:02:35.750> still<00:02:36.079> got<00:02:37.480> leaky<00:02:38.480> block

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
plaster you've still got leaky block

plaster you've still got leaky block
work<00:02:38.959> behind<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.769> we've<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:41.829> poaching

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
work behind it so we've got poaching

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.949 
work behind it so we've got poaching
code<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:44.030> still<00:02:44.239> got<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> puncture<00:02:44.870> it

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
code but we still got a puncture it

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.050 
code but we still got a puncture it
obviously<00:02:45.319> for<00:02:45.620> structural<00:02:46.010> stability<00:02:46.250> so

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
obviously for structural stability so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.900 
obviously for structural stability so
what<00:02:47.359> we've<00:02:47.540> used<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:48.549> stainless<00:02:49.549> steel

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
what we've used is stainless steel
