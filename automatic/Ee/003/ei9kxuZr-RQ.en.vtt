00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.439
 hi everyone or just from 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.149
 zinc so today we find ourselves a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.640
 new fashion presentation for the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.800
 1.2.2 this time when it comes from 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 go out first you do not know far 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 about ten days I would say so 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 I present you mode timbers a mode 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.730
 not bad use the one I put myself 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.769
 a credit to show you to people what 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 that they do that he adds a physics 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.610
 a little more realistic to the goal at 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.439
 background in minecraft before when we break 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.110
 is trees let me admit that I 

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:07.070
 surrender a neutron patch breaks a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.030
 tree we were going to have to go like that 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 a blue by bhl 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 finally not constantly is designed 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 to work a creative and at the mine 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.659
 like that it did not work 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.700
 but if you go with an ax, I'll go 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.460
 to put back on horseback one can fart that and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.240
 the whole tree comes with a little book 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.830
 falls 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 no matter the position of the logs or 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.210
 a construction all that does not affect the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 trees of course that it benefits us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.390
 is that leaves do not fall so 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.870
 physical work even if it's a 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.280
 awesome move so that's like 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.390
 usually it's his bosses have everything 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 to fall the tree that adds another meaning 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.440
 of realism helps the parish for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 your h 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.770
 so it works otherwise it's not a past 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 blue power it also works with the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.900
 jungle arts the leaves ended by 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.370
 disappear by itself 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:12.200
 what I want to show also do not eat at 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.630
 the hand or maybe scholarly name up 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.570
 9am 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.340
 so the plates come with 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.230
 yes of course sonata have cut in half 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 of the tree the risk was a beautiful that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 you have not got to stay there moussa 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.860
 so otherwise it's like it's working 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 all the trees that will go up some 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.760
 examples are not expected to mix 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 trees besides the same on tech 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.340
 so here I have all the logs mix 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 two graves 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.300
 my son is gla at troop point blaise 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.590
 limoges two sides this morning i place 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:00.560
 all a little weird magnus are all 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.500
 two sides it's all start late and paf 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.270
 they are also fearing there is in this 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.410
 a little less realistic sense 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.470
 nathan at Takkal harness if you 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:18.140
 cut in the wood he goes he will fall 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:20.470
 attention all weird as only the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.470
 jury 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:30.610
 the rest will fall 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.610
 like it was a little off Thursday at the 9th 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.970
 if it is less presentation mode 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.340
 these times to make it like 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 lapointe 31.3 points out there is no 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.510
 large autonomous mode so we go in my 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.190
 little house of diamonds for not 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.130
 show that it does not work I'm 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.940
 absolutely build too when I 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.490
 said as easy as that by going 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.490
 up to 10 the beautiful country blog lives with 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.390
 so it's really a very long 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.730
 experience so we put that you 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.420
 show the example of time at all I 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:11.570
 did a species build have predicted 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 that those dollars that I had everything we 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.609
 find to his children here to fart in 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.590
 a knock 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:25.820
 here we are as easy as that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.729
 the beautiful came with so I would say 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.020
 it's really convenient as a fashion 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.720
 especially when one borrows forests from 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.840
 10 million damage or the test 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.840
 ultimate
