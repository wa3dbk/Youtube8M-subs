00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.410

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 this honey palette is here 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.769
 there is a mirror and here are yourself 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.900
 then there are 10 shades of brown and u10 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.460
 also black and so know 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.900
 enters attack brown pencil ki 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.219
 as far as I know these palettes are already being cleaned 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.130
 with the sale as they left 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.469
 updated versions where a bit more 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 shades but still on some sites 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.160
 these palettes can also be found and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.350
 often they are discounts 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 that is, if they were previously sold by 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.010
 39 dollars then often I notice 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 that on different sites they even have 20 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000
 I sell dollars by the way, too, for 20 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.829
 dollars I managed to grab 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.170
 but now I'll start as always 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.449

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.919
 I really like they are not so soft 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.470
 Like Lorak about them, they are 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.810
 solid you and but they are very good 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.389

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.970

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.099
 a little showered and now I'll show you 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.580
 pencil pencil pencil there is here 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.620
 such is brown automatically and here 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.340
 so here he looks he is very very 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.719
 soft 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.460
 very as pigmented as you know 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.460
 even the texture is like a gel and an eye 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.069
 dasha because well very soft here in 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.280
 each palette corresponding

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.620

 pencils will be purple if there I am not 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.819
 I remember in some other palettes there 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.009
 in my opinion there is somewhere with black 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.960
 pencil in general I have so as not 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.210
 giving such a sick palette was therefore 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.160
