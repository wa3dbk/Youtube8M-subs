after<00:00:46.200> year<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.300> grow<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> just

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690

about anything they can grow in gravel

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
about anything they can grow in gravel
we've<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.149> moist

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
we've just got a little bit of moist

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
we've just got a little bit of moist
potting<00:00:52.260> mix<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.860> were<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
potting mix in here that were going to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
potting mix in here that were going to
use<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.640> shallow<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.510> for

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
use and that's how shallow it can be for

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.619 
use and that's how shallow it can be for
paper<00:00:55.530> whites<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.579> everything<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
paper whites because everything this

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.830 
paper whites because everything this
plant<00:00:57.899> needs<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.850> bulb<00:01:00.180> it's

plant needs is right in this bulb it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.549 
plant needs is right in this bulb it's
already<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
already there

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
already there
and<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> needs<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> moisture<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.270> it's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and so all it needs is moisture and it's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.850 
and so all it needs is moisture and it's
going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> go<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> town<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.439> let's<00:01:04.619> start

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
going to go to town and so let's start

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
going to go to town and so let's start
here<00:01:05.040> by<00:01:05.189> planting<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.330> dish<00:01:06.510> the

planting<00:01:07.890> mix<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> use<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> use

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
planting mix that I use is what I use

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109 
planting mix that I use is what I use
for<00:01:09.390> seeds<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.560> potting<00:01:11.220> mix<00:01:11.549> anything<00:01:11.970> like

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that it's perfect for them and I like to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.760 
that it's perfect for them and I like to
plant<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.700> very<00:01:14.880> close<00:01:15.119> together

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
plant them very close together

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
plant them very close together
eventually<00:01:16.880> these<00:01:17.880> would<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.600> sprout<00:01:18.930> out

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
eventually these would will sprout out

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
eventually these would will sprout out
roots<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.740> these<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.400> straight<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
roots and these will go straight up and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
roots and these will go straight up and
make<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.320> flowers<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> we're<00:01:23.040> gonna<00:01:23.159> put

them<00:01:23.400> very<00:01:23.610> close<00:01:23.880> together<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.189> or

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
them very close together and in two or

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
them very close together and in two or
three<00:01:26.369> days<00:01:26.700> you'll<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> won't<00:01:28.110> be

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
three days you'll see that you won't be

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.660 
three days you'll see that you won't be
able<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> pull<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.280> anymore

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
able to pull these out of here anymore

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.990 
able to pull these out of here anymore
now<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:30.869> paper<00:01:31.380> whites<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
now the thing about paper whites is that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.140 
now the thing about paper whites is that
fragrant<00:01:34.340> smell<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> that's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
fragrant smell that they have that's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
fragrant smell that they have that's
either<00:01:36.450> love<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.049> hate<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.860> love<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
either love it or hate it and I love it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
either love it or hate it and I love it
and<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.420> only<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> explain<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and the only way I can explain it is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
and the only way I can explain it is
you'll<00:01:41.250> figure<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.729> once<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.180> bloom

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
you'll figure it out once they bloom

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.609 
you'll figure it out once they bloom
usually<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:42.930> love<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.439> hate<00:01:43.560> them

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.069 
something inside now number one question
when<00:03:24.400> we're<00:03:24.549> talking<00:03:24.730> about<00:03:25.030> amaryllis<00:03:25.810> are

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
when we're talking about amaryllis are

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.199 
when we're talking about amaryllis are

what do you do after they bloom how do I

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.210 
what do you do after they bloom how do I
get<00:03:28.329> them<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> read<00:03:28.750> bloom<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.260> again<00:03:29.890> it's

very<00:03:30.280> very<00:03:30.820> simple<00:03:31.299> to<00:03:31.510> do<00:03:31.739> after<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.250> plant

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
very very simple to do after the plant

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.300 
very very simple to do after the plant
blooms<00:03:33.850> will<00:03:34.810> remove<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.350> stalk<00:03:35.709> here<00:03:36.100> and

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
blooms will remove this stalk here and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.569 
blooms will remove this stalk here and
all<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.489> we<00:03:36.760> left<00:03:37.000> are<00:03:37.870> these<00:03:38.190> leaves<00:03:39.190> just

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
all that we left are these leaves just

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.289 
all that we left are these leaves just
like<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.359> they'll<00:03:41.079> get<00:03:41.200> really<00:03:41.470> big<00:03:41.799> and

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
like this and they'll get really big and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
a pot but then we get to August we stop

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.390 
a pot but then we get to August we stop
all<00:04:01.390> fertilization<00:04:02.230> we<00:04:02.350> stop<00:04:02.590> all<00:04:02.799> watering

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
all fertilization we stop all watering

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.449 
all fertilization we stop all watering
and<00:04:03.519> that's<00:04:03.700> when<00:04:03.850> we<00:04:03.940> end<00:04:04.060> up<00:04:04.209> with<00:04:04.359> this<00:04:05.459> you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and that's when we end up with this you

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.099 
and that's when we end up with this you
know<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.670> goes<00:04:06.790> dormant<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.600> looks<00:04:07.810> like<00:04:07.930> it's

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
know it goes dormant it looks like it's

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.280 
know it goes dormant it looks like it's
dead<00:04:08.880> but<00:04:09.880> when<00:04:10.389> it<00:04:10.480> goes<00:04:10.600> dormant<00:04:10.959> needs

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
dead but when it goes dormant needs

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.440 
dead but when it goes dormant needs
about<00:04:11.470> six<00:04:11.769> weeks<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:12.130> dormancy<00:04:12.519> then<00:04:13.299> it's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
about six weeks of dormancy then it's

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.720 
about six weeks of dormancy then it's
ready<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.750> replant<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.040> we<00:04:15.340> start<00:04:15.609> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
ready to replant it and we start the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.590 
ready to replant it and we start the
same<00:04:16.000> thing<00:04:16.450> again<00:04:16.810> we<00:04:17.799> take<00:04:18.010> our<00:04:18.160> pot

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
same thing again we take our pot

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.120 
same thing again we take our pot
and<00:04:20.050> we<00:04:20.230> take<00:04:20.380> one<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.590> just<00:04:20.710> a<00:04:20.770> little<00:04:20.920> bit

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
and we take one it's just a little bit

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.860 
and we take one it's just a little bit
bigger<00:04:21.340> than<00:04:21.490> the<00:04:21.610> pot<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.090> was<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.480> one

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
bigger than the pot that it was in one

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.110 
bigger than the pot that it was in one
size<00:04:23.140> bigger<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.770> you'll<00:04:24.670> see<00:04:24.850> when<00:04:24.940> we<00:04:25.030> take

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
size bigger and you'll see when we take

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
size bigger and you'll see when we take
this<00:04:25.270> out<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.480> roots<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.960> grown<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.410> well

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
this out the roots have grown so well

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.710 
this out the roots have grown so well
look<00:04:26.890> at<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.210> everything<00:04:28.210> comes<00:04:28.330> out<00:04:28.540> with

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
look at that everything comes out with

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.270 
look at that everything comes out with
its<00:04:28.900> completely<00:04:29.320> dry<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.800> see<00:04:30.040> all<00:04:30.130> those

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
its completely dry and you see all those

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.190 
its completely dry and you see all those
roots<00:04:30.550> there<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.030> then<00:04:31.570> we<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.720> tuck<00:04:32.050> it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
roots there and then we just tuck it

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.820 
roots there and then we just tuck it
into<00:04:32.350> this<00:04:33.060> mix<00:04:34.060> right<00:04:34.300> here

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
into this mix right here

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.760 
into this mix right here
and<00:04:35.830> we'll<00:04:36.280> put<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.490> little<00:04:36.700> bit<00:04:36.880> more<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.710> you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
and we'll put a little bit more and you

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.440 
and we'll put a little bit more and you
can<00:04:38.890> see<00:04:39.070> it's<00:04:39.220> actually<00:04:39.580> started<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.060> make<00:04:40.210> a

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
can see it's actually started to make a

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.450 
can see it's actually started to make a
second<00:04:40.960> bulb<00:04:41.170> here<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:42.220> what<00:04:42.370> will

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
second bulb here and that's what will

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.730 
second bulb here and that's what will
happen<00:04:42.580> over<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.120> years<00:04:43.440> over<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.620> the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
happen over the years over in the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.590 
happen over the years over in the
windowsill<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.220> probably<00:04:45.550> have<00:04:45.820> I<00:04:46.150> don't<00:04:46.510> know

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
windowsill I probably have I don't know

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.080 
windowsill I probably have I don't know
10<00:04:47.260> or<00:04:47.290> 15<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:47.890> these<00:04:48.100> from<00:04:48.490> from<00:04:48.760> over<00:04:48.970> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
10 or 15 of these from from over the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.090 
10 or 15 of these from from over the
years<00:04:49.120> it's<00:04:50.080> always<00:04:50.320> fun<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.590> get<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.740> new<00:04:50.800> one

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
years it's always fun to get a new one

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.470 
years it's always fun to get a new one
because<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.520> it's<00:04:51.730> gonna<00:04:51.790> bloom<00:04:52.120> like

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
because you know it's gonna bloom like

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.850 
because you know it's gonna bloom like
