 first of all raval on computers that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 they break to the minimum tired of trying 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.529
 record on incomprehensible computers 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.170
 tired of trying to record in those 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.410
 computers so sensitive for all 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 arrives in capture hd2 of having half 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 good guys, as you have seen the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.109
 introduction of the video as you have 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 listened to this is a capturing that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.990
 whose main characteristic is that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 record without needing pc that is to say that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.109
 if you have a pc more or less like mine 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 that is, it gives you many problems or not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.640
 you have money to buy us a super 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.550
 cucumber that allows recording to a quality 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 stratospheric as this is yours 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.180
 best option is your best option 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.000
 because it allows you to record in full hd 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.350
 1080p without the need for a computer 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.050
 one of its main characteristics 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.340
 is that part of what goes with hdmi vale 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.950
 guys, so I'm going to open it now 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.660
 tell you more little things apart from this 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.340
 record wii ps3 and xbox 360 is also called 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.890
 in scoop and exclusively it has 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.550
 statement that you are working to see 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.670
 what are the ways of bringing gameplays 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 playstation 4 and xbox one at the moment 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.530
 of its release so little by little 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.470
 guys this new generation of consoles 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.170
 that is about to arrive can cause 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.860
 much evolution in the world of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.860
 catch 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.180
 as you see guys here I have the 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.840
 Capturing your power is a bit big 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.760
 as you can see but it has an elegant design 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.630
 red on the back and black on the front with 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.310
 the symbol of having mean and here all 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.220
 the tickets that you need audio 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.979
 hdmi network connection cable 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.020
 electrical etc. here we have the cable 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.520
 hdmi and you know guys from the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 capturing to television 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.930
 we also have an adapter 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.869
 the electrical connection of Spain and 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.020
 you know when there is this problem 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.180
 because this capturing averaged because we 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.739
 allows the ease of being able to connect 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.989
 to the symmetry plug to go to our 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.420
 relative to buying an adapter and what's more 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.730
 pulo of a whole command to be able to use 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
 capture now you can use it from the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.890
 software without having to get up to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 change the channel 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.650
 this command is totally useful 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.760
 distance who does not need it or is 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.380
 who does not want a remote control 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.100
 for a capturing is the best 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.799
 has bone so record play capture a 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.650
 picture understand it turn it off change 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:46.000
 channel and so on guys this command which 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.460
 come with do not ask we have to put it 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.030
 we have no problem 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.300
 they are two batteries so the control is very useful 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.600
 here comes the cable to connect to the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.150
 electrical network that comes and so they have 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.240
 how to use it here this is taken out and good 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.660
 here, it gets in if you're Spanish this and 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.760
 If you are American then this one in America 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.070
 terra unit I do not know or where it is because it is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.410
 different has to put three but of 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.940
 Spain we have this shot so it's 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.220
 so comfortable this capture that comes to you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.830
 up with two possible electrical outlets 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.830
 by the way here were the batteries to see 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.130
 half pizza in all that brand 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.840
 mitsubishi to then say no 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.760
 they worry, it also comes to you as 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 always the instruction manual of the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.470
 media in English French German Italian 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.550
 Spanish and Portuguese 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.930
 totally comfortable totally useful if not 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.210
 you understand something by what you see in the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.040
 manual and superbly you explain it 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.560
 well this has been the unboxing guys of 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.510
 the catcher anyway 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.700
 I suppose you will have many doubts 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.480
 that I will try to answer you in the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.280
 comments but one second do not move 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.290
 my friend chema of having average has in 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.060
 your channel on the official channel of media a 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.530
 tutorial in which he explains perfectly 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.560
 all the steps to follow to connect 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.990
 your capture to use it to upload 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.510
 the videos directly from the capture 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.180
 no need to render only with the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.109
 possibility of cutting them and so on guys 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.709
 The only thing I want to make clear is that 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 you do not need a PC to record that's the most 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.900
 comfortable so any doubt you already know 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.880
 in the comments or in the video that you 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.820
 I will leave on a label in the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.150
 screen and also in the description of 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.600
 video 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.750
 down there for you to see it okay guys 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.820
 it's very good it's a perfect tutorial and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.000
 good apart wanted to take what 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.120
 seen you can put a card in the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.830
 capturing very comfortable too but 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.140
 well I'm not the expert in 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.350
 capturing system so let's leave it at 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.600
 the technical section I prefer that 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.430
 the start to use I'm actually going to 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.350
 try to burn pc with it since it 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.590
 you can and you know maybe you can give us 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.730
 a game of lol or whatever so 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.920
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.730
