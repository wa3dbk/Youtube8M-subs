holes here now this gasket here already
has<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> hole<00:04:32.820> down<00:04:33.060> here<00:04:33.120> at<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.479> bottom<00:04:33.900> on

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
has a hole down here at the bottom on

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.080 
has a hole down here at the bottom on
both<00:04:34.260> sides<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:34.889> you<00:04:34.919> can't<00:04:35.310> put<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.669> on<00:04:35.760> wrong

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
both sides so you can't put it on wrong

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020 
both sides so you can't put it on wrong
and<00:04:36.870> what<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.199> hole<00:04:37.410> has<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.919> do<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.700> allow

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and what that hole has to do is allow

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.090 
and what that hole has to do is allow
fuel<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.510> pass<00:04:39.720> through<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.320> from<00:04:40.950> the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
fuel to pass through here from the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.230 
fuel to pass through here from the
metering<00:04:41.460> block<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:43.130> area<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.850> fuel

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
bowl where the accelerator pump is so

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.580 
bowl where the accelerator pump is so
this<00:04:48.240> here<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.900> doesn't<00:04:49.229> really<00:04:49.320> matter

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590

the little little tits there it should

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.860 
the little little tits there it should
hold<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.710> gasket<00:04:59.130> in<00:04:59.220> place<00:04:59.250> for<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.820> now<00:05:00.720> on

hold the gasket in place for you now on

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.010 
hold the gasket in place for you now on
the<00:05:00.960> other<00:05:01.050> side<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.510> two<00:05:03.510> metering

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
the other side we have two metering

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.640 
the other side we have two metering
block<00:05:04.949> gaskets<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.699> are<00:05:06.150> identical<00:05:06.930> they're

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
block gaskets that are identical they're

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.820 
block gaskets that are identical they're
the<00:05:07.800> same<00:05:07.979> gasket<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:10.470> we're<00:05:10.590> just<00:05:10.620> going

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
the same gasket and so we're just going

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.480 
the same gasket and so we're just going
to<00:05:10.919> grab<00:05:11.100> one<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.550> them<00:05:11.700> and<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:14.039> can't<00:05:14.310> really

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
to grab one of them and you can't really

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.150 
to grab one of them and you can't really
go<00:05:14.789> wrong<00:05:15.030> with<00:05:15.090> these<00:05:15.510> either<00:05:15.889> because<00:05:16.889> they

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
go wrong with these either because they

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.850 
go wrong with these either because they
will<00:05:17.850> only<00:05:18.030> go<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.389> one<00:05:18.419> way<00:05:18.600> there's<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.560> tip

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
will only go in one way there's a tip

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.770 
will only go in one way there's a tip
sticking<00:05:20.280> out<00:05:20.400> here<00:05:20.580> about<00:05:20.700> midway<00:05:21.030> down<00:05:21.240> and

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
sticking out here about midway down and

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.080 
sticking out here about midway down and
then<00:05:22.110> there's<00:05:22.320> one<00:05:22.530> sticking<00:05:22.979> out<00:05:23.130> right<00:05:23.400> up

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
then there's one sticking out right up

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.810 
then there's one sticking out right up
here<00:05:24.389> probably<00:05:24.720> about<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:25.020> third<00:05:25.289> way<00:05:25.620> down<00:05:25.860> so

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
here probably about a third way down so

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.490 
here probably about a third way down so
you<00:05:26.849> go<00:05:26.940> ahead<00:05:27.060> stick<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.510> gasket<00:05:27.960> on<00:05:28.080> here

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
you go ahead stick the gasket on here

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.710 
you go ahead stick the gasket on here
in<00:05:28.800> place<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.430> you're<00:05:29.580> good<00:05:29.729> to<00:05:29.760> go<00:05:30.000> this

in place and you're good to go this
metering<00:05:31.200> block<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.830> ready<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.400> be<00:05:32.520> installed

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
metering block is ready to be installed

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.159 
metering block is ready to be installed
so<00:05:33.090> we're<00:05:33.210> gonna<00:05:33.330> go<00:05:33.419> ahead<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:33.630> lay<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.930> over

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
so we're gonna go ahead and lay it over

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.310 
so we're gonna go ahead and lay it over
here<00:05:34.380> with<00:05:35.130> our<00:05:35.310> front<00:05:35.520> fuel<00:05:35.849> bowl<00:05:36.169> and<00:05:37.169> now

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
here with our front fuel bowl and now

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.390 
here with our front fuel bowl and now
we're<00:05:37.500> gonna<00:05:37.590> go<00:05:37.800> ahead<00:05:37.889> I'm<00:05:38.160> gonna<00:05:38.250> go<00:05:38.340> ahead

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
we're gonna go ahead I'm gonna go ahead

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.310 
we're gonna go ahead I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:05:38.550> put<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> rear<00:05:39.030> one<00:05:39.240> together<00:05:39.360> basically

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
and put the rear one together basically

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.740 
and put the rear one together basically
the<00:05:40.650> same<00:05:40.830> as<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.130> front<00:05:41.340> one<00:05:41.580> only<00:05:42.210> thing<00:05:42.419> is

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
the same as the front one only thing is

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.089 
the same as the front one only thing is
we<00:05:43.410> don't<00:05:43.560> have<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:44.039> install<00:05:45.800> mixture<00:05:46.800> screws

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
we don't have to install mixture screws

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.770 
we don't have to install mixture screws
on<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.460> one<00:05:47.639> so<00:05:47.789> let's<00:05:47.970> get<00:05:48.090> this<00:05:48.300> one<00:05:48.360> set

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
on this one so let's get this one set

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.729 
on this one so let's get this one set
and<00:05:48.960> then<00:05:49.560> we'll<00:05:49.710> move<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.280> main<00:05:50.460> body
