00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
there and we're going to do here is put

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.190 
there and we're going to do here is put
it<00:03:45.860> in<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:45.980> cozy<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:46.819> that<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:50.200> carefully

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.750 

something<00:04:09.820> pretty<00:04:10.030> getting<00:04:10.330> their<00:04:11.520> seal<00:04:12.520> up

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.930 

it<00:04:21.560> probably<00:04:21.979> starts<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.250> get<00:04:22.310> cold<00:04:22.669> or

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
it probably starts to get cold or

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.689 
it probably starts to get cold or
fingers<00:04:23.419> don't<00:04:23.539> want<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.810> work<00:04:23.900> outside<00:04:25.180> okay

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.689 
and then we're just going to let that
sit<00:04:29.900> there<00:04:30.080> for<00:04:30.259> about<00:04:30.289> 15<00:04:30.860> minutes<00:04:31.069> move<00:04:31.370> back

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699
