00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
to be here with Nuria because we've

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.100 
to be here with Nuria because we've
never<00:01:21.610> piled<00:01:21.970> much<00:01:22.270> creaking<00:01:22.810> together

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
never piled much creaking together

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.280 
never piled much creaking together
before<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:25.060> think<00:01:25.330> he's<00:01:25.420> gonna<00:01:25.540> be<00:01:25.750> either

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
before and I think he's gonna be either

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.820 
before and I think he's gonna be either
really<00:01:26.740> bonding<00:01:27.340> experience<00:01:28.000> or<00:01:28.649> could<00:01:29.649> be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
really bonding experience or could be

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.249 
really bonding experience or could be
quite<00:01:30.369> opposite<00:01:30.790> but<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:31.540> think<00:01:31.869> we'll<00:01:31.990> still

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
quite opposite but I think we'll still

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.139 
quite opposite but I think we'll still
be<00:01:32.410> friends<00:01:32.560> at<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.890> end<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.460> yeah<00:01:33.970> this

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
be friends at the end of it so yeah this

00:01:34.149 --> 00:02:10.010 
be friends at the end of it so yeah this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
putting some M&amp;Ms in it it looks like

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.010

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
colorful I guess as we were feeding on

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.030 
colorful I guess as we were feeding on
the<00:02:52.030> river<00:02:52.210> again<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> next<00:02:52.900> morning<00:02:53.290> we
