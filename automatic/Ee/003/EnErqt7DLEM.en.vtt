you to get it so do you think that you
like<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.389> image<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.959> how<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.229> looks<00:03:35.409> on<00:03:35.650> you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
like the image and how it looks on you

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.860 
like the image and how it looks on you
go<00:03:36.280> ahead<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.669> get<00:03:36.819> it<00:03:36.940> because<00:03:37.090> nobody<00:03:37.750> can

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
go ahead and get it because nobody can

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.689 
go ahead and get it because nobody can
care<00:03:38.260> about<00:03:38.290> what<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.650> think<00:03:39.129> about<00:03:39.579> it

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
care about what I think about it

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.729 
care about what I think about it
ultimately<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.449> is<00:03:40.599> imprinted<00:03:41.079> on<00:03:41.319> your<00:03:41.590> body

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
ultimately it is imprinted on your body

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.159 
ultimately it is imprinted on your body
and<00:03:41.919> not<00:03:42.099> there<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.790> be<00:03:42.849> regarding<00:03:43.359> pain<00:03:43.690> level

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
and not there to be regarding pain level

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.379 
and not there to be regarding pain level
I<00:03:44.290> would<00:03:44.349> say<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:45.250> know<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:45.970> my<00:03:46.180> nose

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
piercing with about 1 to 10 because the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.030
