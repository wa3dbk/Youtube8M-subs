00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
because we're Fernando Torres especially

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.830 
because we're Fernando Torres especially
black<00:02:33.639> season<00:02:34.000> when<00:02:34.090> he<00:02:34.150> did<00:02:34.299> get<00:02:34.450> through<00:02:34.689> on

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
black season when he did get through on

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.920 
black season when he did get through on
gold<00:02:35.109> he<00:02:35.620> was<00:02:35.920> scoring<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> think<00:02:37.569> he's<00:02:37.780> just

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
gold he was scoring so I think he's just

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.720 
gold he was scoring so I think he's just
really<00:02:38.139> getting<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> right<00:02:38.859> tactics<00:02:39.189> to<00:02:39.549> get

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
really getting the right tactics to get

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.979 
really getting the right tactics to get
him<00:02:39.879> through<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.239> goal<00:02:40.419> to<00:02:40.629> giving<00:02:40.900> those

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
him through on goal to giving those

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.390 
him through on goal to giving those
opportunities<00:02:41.469> to<00:02:41.680> put<00:02:41.859> the<00:02:41.950> ball<00:02:42.099> into<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
opportunities to put the ball into the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.039 
opportunities to put the ball into the
back<00:02:42.579> of<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.790> net<00:02:42.969> and<00:02:43.209> not<00:02:43.659> giving<00:02:43.930> these

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
back of the net and not giving these

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.809 
back of the net and not giving these
opportunities<00:02:44.499> where<00:02:44.709> he<00:02:44.889> receives<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.669> ball

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
opportunities where he receives the ball

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.879 
opportunities where he receives the ball
and<00:02:46.209> has<00:02:46.389> to<00:02:46.599> be<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:47.049> or<00:02:47.079> two<00:02:47.230> defenders

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
and has to be one or two defenders

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.369 
and has to be one or two defenders
because<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.909> be<00:02:49.030> fair<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.329> don't<00:02:49.930> think<00:02:50.430> he's<00:02:51.430> as

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
because to be fair I don't think he's as

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.289 
because to be fair I don't think he's as
good<00:02:53.379> as<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:54.099> he<00:02:54.400> used<00:02:54.609> to<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.909> like<00:02:55.030> back

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
good as that as he used to be like back

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.580 
good as that as he used to be like back
at<00:02:55.449> Liverpool<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.900> could<00:02:56.109> be<00:02:56.260> three<00:02:56.560> four

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
at Liverpool you could be three four

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.199 
at Liverpool you could be three four
five<00:02:56.980> players<00:02:57.280> we<00:02:57.459> wanted<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.000> know<00:02:58.060> he

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
five players we wanted to you know he

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.659 
five players we wanted to you know he
was<00:02:58.359> that<00:02:58.389> good<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> don't<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:00.400> he<00:03:00.519> could

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
was that good but I don't think he could

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:01.949 
was that good but I don't think he could
do<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.879> right<00:03:01.090> now<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.510> think<00:03:01.750> he<00:03:01.810> could

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
do that right now but I think he could

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.559 
do that right now but I think he could
still<00:03:02.169> be<00:03:02.199> one<00:03:02.530> or<00:03:02.650> two<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.129> for<00:03:03.699> me<00:03:03.849> Fernando

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
still be one or two so for me Fernando

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.939 
still be one or two so for me Fernando
Torres<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.989> need<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.349> be<00:03:05.469> given<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.799> note

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
Torres you need to be given a note

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.159 
Torres you need to be given a note

the<00:03:53.560> problem<00:03:54.099> is<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.370> he<00:03:54.609> will<00:03:54.729> not<00:03:54.819> do

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
the problem is is that he will not do

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.069 
the problem is is that he will not do

and<00:04:15.759> to<00:04:16.239> be<00:04:16.329> fair<00:04:16.539> I<00:04:16.599> think<00:04:16.810> as<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.049> do<00:04:17.889> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
and to be fair I think as I do the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.490 
and to be fair I think as I do the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
flicks do the tricks but know when to do

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.439 
flicks do the tricks but know when to do
i<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.680> in<00:04:20.949> pre-season<00:04:21.609> up<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.240> whole

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
i think in pre-season up this whole

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.029 
i think in pre-season up this whole
preseason<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.990> think<00:04:23.169> you've<00:04:23.260> done<00:04:23.289> a<00:04:23.560> little

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
preseason I think you've done a little

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.519 
preseason I think you've done a little
bit<00:04:24.279> too<00:04:24.520> many<00:04:24.699> of<00:04:24.849> them<00:04:24.969> and<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.630> like<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.320> see

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:26.529 
bit too many of them and I like to see

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.330 
bit too many of them and I like to see
them<00:04:26.650> but

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
them but

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.150 
them but
so<00:04:27.900> they<00:04:28.900> have<00:04:29.080> been<00:04:29.320> pretty<00:04:29.530> frequent<00:04:30.040> so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
so they have been pretty frequent so

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.800 
so they have been pretty frequent so
that's<00:04:30.310> why<00:04:30.430> one<00:04:30.699> thing<00:04:30.910> I<00:04:30.970> want<00:04:31.330> Ariel<00:04:31.780> I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
that's why one thing I want Ariel I

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.330 
that's why one thing I want Ariel I
think<00:04:32.139> either<00:04:32.260> has<00:04:32.500> our<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:32.919> of<00:04:33.010> improved

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
think either has our kind of improved

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.500 
think either has our kind of improved
but<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.580> won't<00:04:33.760> do<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.150> Premier<00:04:34.480> League

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
I'm sure for me I think that's not

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.050
