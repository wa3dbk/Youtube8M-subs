00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.110
 all people come to a new video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.810
 by marco and yes I am standing today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.910
 again presented before the last 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.200
 namely have annoyed why still seemed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 let's just imagine for the reason 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.710
 they have changed a lot here as well 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.269
 I have game mode now so I can 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.460
 By the way , I have fly around here 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.680
 also beat of course op so it can 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.240
 just give everything and that's it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.699
 good because I want to introduce everything 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 and yes then you pay as you are here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 sees is the building right changed so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.700
 jamin huge spawn I do that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.170
 video but not too boring already 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.520
 everything explained so it would not have 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 time to clarify so as I said money 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.899
 you get jobs jobs with jobs 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
 if you are extreme on the server 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.750
 True register password as yours 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 password for choice and then login 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 password and then it's your turn 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.399
 Almost done so we have saved 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.260
 here quite a lot of portals this very cool 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.300
 lately i forgot the pvp 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.010
 you have svp here is that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.359
 very cool 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.379
 that just a little web and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.420
 I have no give 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.610
 okay that is a clear protection monument 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.250
 and of course that is very unfavorable 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 kreiskys well ok test is it again 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 as I said when you fell against 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.700
 Relatively game mode that's a good one 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 protection 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:24.180
 but I am yes the pvp is here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 is lava and so that's a little 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 now a little exploring yourself 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 just a small amount so small 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 That's just fine when you look at yourself 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.200
 then more difficult encounters I find 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.880
 by the way, esport sports is sport 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.079
 brown and yes that's cool so that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.430
 very cool with us I think is 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 not quite as big as the little one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.860
 Small again so the little one was still there 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.329
 a little bit smaller as I said 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.579
 then we have the sand trap so 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.630
 we all know what we are going to 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.619
 I did not have a medal lately 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.829
 but probably presented that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.350
 imagine the Froebel for faq and 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.820
 finally presented to nyse shops for 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 the first as a possibility to bring only 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.049
 I'll show you again 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 have come a gs one naturally looks 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.970
 with 1 gs traumatic motto if we have that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 we can build it right away and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.230
 here yes 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 his giveaway no longer give his thing 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.240
 down to business 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.090
 it can start building here directly 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.750
 So that's our gs here 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:32.880
 works but whether sport or / bonn 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:37.600
 the same now here we have 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.990
 peacefully cool i was in 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.630
 Trashcan 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.790
 but do it as pure and here again 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.810
 one and here again is ours 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 We can change completely 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.790
 team up and yes that's said here 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010
 osbourne 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 there are the portals again so yes me 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.530
 Of course, do not repeat me right now 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.360
 but I just did not know what 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.920
 So that should feed the portals 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.080
 what else was there to imagine 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.280
 for example, the user shops user shops eight 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.610
 Also present the conclusion 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.410
 I am then to reject no matter so the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.790
 user shops cool that he's from the shop 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.989
 buy and then very expand 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:25.750
 I think maybe here 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:28.660
 No matter we started at the beginning of the year, I did 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.670
 old shows so as I said look as 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.709
 Video walls more in the 500c I want 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.780
 actually everything explains but money / 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.650
 money and yes that's it then it was 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.650
 first of all, j
