I going to show you oblivion here
loading<00:00:03.510> from<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.780> disk<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.470> then<00:00:04.770> later

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
loading from the disk and then later

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.410 
loading from the disk and then later
loading<00:00:06.629> from<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> hard<00:00:07.140> drive<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:08.420> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
loading from the hard drive which the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.100 
loading from the hard drive which the
should<00:00:09.889> be<00:00:10.889> loading<00:00:11.219> from<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> desk<00:00:12.110> because

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
should be loading from the desk because

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.959 
should be loading from the desk because
I<00:00:13.320> didn't<00:00:13.679> actually<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.610> pick<00:00:14.790> load

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
I didn't actually go on and pick load

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.279 
I didn't actually go on and pick load
from<00:00:15.150> hard<00:00:15.360> drive<00:00:15.420> even<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:15.990> stored<00:00:16.139> on

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
from hard drive even that was stored on

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.830 
from hard drive even that was stored on
the<00:00:16.379> hard<00:00:16.410> drive<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.010> may<00:00:17.190> automatically

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
the hard drive it may automatically

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
the hard drive it may automatically
gonna<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.109> listen<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> sun's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
gonna have to listen and see the sun's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.470 
gonna have to listen and see the sun's
like<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> jetliner<00:00:21.000> taking<00:00:21.449> off

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.510 

so<00:00:27.170> far<00:00:27.380> I<00:00:27.410> haven't<00:00:27.619> heard<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:27.980> distance<00:00:28.340> but

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
so far I haven't heard the distance but

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.810 
so far I haven't heard the distance but
also<00:00:29.680> i'm<00:00:30.680> going<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:30.949> assume<00:00:31.039> this<00:00:31.369> is<00:00:31.430> loading

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
also i'm going to assume this is loading

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.979 
also i'm going to assume this is loading
from<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.059> hard<00:00:32.270> drive<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.689> we'll<00:00:32.809> see<00:00:32.960> how

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
from the hard drive so we'll see how

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.319 
from the hard drive so we'll see how
long<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:33.379> takes<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.710> load<00:00:34.210> anyone<00:00:35.210> that's

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
long it takes the load anyone that's

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:44.440 
long it takes the load anyone that's
played<00:00:35.510> oblivion<00:00:35.690> knows

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.240 

notice<00:00:44.840> how<00:00:44.990> long<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.260> takes<00:00:47.980> start<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.070> new

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
notice how long it takes start a new

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.070 
notice how long it takes start a new
game<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:49.880> because<00:00:50.180> there's<00:00:50.360> seems<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.960> be

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
game just because there's seems to be

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.380 
game just because there's seems to be
some<00:00:51.230> issues

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 

see<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> loading<00:00:55.410> bar<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.130> hopefully

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
see the loading bar down there hopefully

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.069 
see the loading bar down there hopefully
it<00:00:56.850> up

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.650 

speeds<00:00:59.710> up

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
speeds up

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.440 
speeds up
oh<00:01:02.820> yeah<00:01:06.030> doing<00:01:07.030> all<00:01:07.210> right<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:10.090> was<00:01:10.210> quite<00:01:10.390> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
oh yeah doing all right that was quite a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.480 
oh yeah doing all right that was quite a
bit<00:01:10.660> faster

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.680 

let's<00:01:19.490> see<00:01:19.700> his<00:01:19.939> name<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.299> a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:42.860 

as<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.350> slammed<00:01:25.590> here

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:53.360 

oh<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:47.580> guess<00:01:48.740> there's<00:01:50.180> your<00:01:51.180> own<00:01:51.360> kin<00:01:52.070> piece<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
oh I guess there's your own kin piece of

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.640 
oh I guess there's your own kin piece of
human<00:01:53.730> track<00:01:57.440> graphics<00:01:58.440> look<00:01:59.220> pretty<00:01:59.550> good<00:01:59.610> I

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
human track graphics look pretty good I

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:08.469 
human track graphics look pretty good I
go<00:02:01.650> load<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.460> an<00:02:02.730> old<00:02:03.000> say<00:02:03.500> really<00:02:04.500> matter

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630 

that's<00:02:09.050> actually<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.649> my<00:02:09.800> game<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.429> move

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
that's actually in my game so you move

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.240 
that's actually in my game so you move
around<00:02:10.759> she<00:02:11.150> has<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.510> little<00:02:11.720> song

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.600 

in<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.000> game<00:02:19.180> by<00:02:19.780> no<00:02:19.840> means<00:02:19.990> loads<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:21.250> fast

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
in the game by no means loads way fast

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.460 
in the game by no means loads way fast
but<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.820> still<00:02:25.060> loads<00:02:25.300> at<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.960> pretty<00:02:26.290> good

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
but it still loads at a pretty good

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.350 
but it still loads at a pretty good
speed<00:02:26.800> compared<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:27.850> would<00:02:28.030> off<00:02:28.210> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
speed compared to what it would off the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.600 
speed compared to what it would off the
desk

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.520 

considering<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.510> used<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.990> catch<00:02:32.200> so

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
considering it used to have the catch so

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.370 
considering it used to have the catch so
much<00:02:32.740> stuff<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.340> actual<00:02:34.080> hard<00:02:35.080> drive

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
much stuff to the actual hard drive

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.190 
much stuff to the actual hard drive
having<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.250> load<00:02:36.430> off<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.790> entire<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.390> mean<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
having it load off the entire I mean the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200 
having it load off the entire I mean the
entire<00:02:38.470> game<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> hard<00:02:39.130> drive<00:02:39.340> makes<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
entire game of the hard drive makes a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:50.660 
entire game of the hard drive makes a
big<00:02:40.420> difference

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.640 

I'll<00:02:51.240> ever<00:02:51.480> remember<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.050> game<00:02:52.260> looking

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'll ever remember this game looking

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.620 
I'll ever remember this game looking
this<00:02:52.770> good<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.870> pretty<00:02:55.230> amazing<00:02:56.480> I'm<00:02:57.480> not

this good it's pretty amazing I'm not
saying<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.020> updates<00:02:58.380> better

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
saying the updates better

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:21.309 
saying the updates better
sanit<00:03:01.820> looks<00:03:01.970> darn<00:03:02.270> good

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:42.990 

I<00:03:23.230> loaded<00:03:24.230> pretty<00:03:24.680> quick

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
them off the hard drive I suggest

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.930

do<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:45.890> please<00:05:51.260> plez<00:05:52.260> as<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.530> bagger

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.580 

so<00:06:00.150> when<00:06:00.240> you<00:06:00.330> applied<00:06:00.599> his<00:06:00.780> background<00:06:01.229> this

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
so when you applied his background this

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.429 
so when you applied his background this
kind<00:06:01.830> of<00:06:01.999> hides<00:06:02.999> back<00:06:03.389> there<00:06:03.689> under<00:06:04.289> the

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:04.439 
kind of hides back there under the

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.800 
kind of hides back there under the
grayness<00:06:05.090> just<00:06:06.090> kind<00:06:06.300> of<00:06:06.419> kind<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.930> lousy<00:06:08.779> so<00:06:09.779> I

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
grayness just kind of kind of lousy so I

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.149 
grayness just kind of kind of lousy so I
guess<00:06:09.960> it's<00:06:10.169> better<00:06:10.349> to<00:06:10.560> go<00:06:10.710> with<00:06:13.159> actual

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
guess it's better to go with actual

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:20.110 
guess it's better to go with actual
themes

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.420 

by<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.180> way<00:06:21.390> tomorrow<00:06:22.140> is<00:06:22.350> a<00:06:22.470> big<00:06:22.650> day<00:06:22.680> get

by the way tomorrow is a big day get

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.540 
by the way tomorrow is a big day get
other<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:23.790> vote<00:06:24.060> for<00:06:24.090> Obama<00:06:25.130> you<00:06:26.130> can<00:06:26.370> vote

other and vote for Obama you can vote
for<00:06:26.610> mccain<00:06:27.120> but<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:28.260> makes<00:06:28.470> you<00:06:28.710> stupid

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
for mccain but it makes you stupid

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.500 
for mccain but it makes you stupid
that's<00:06:31.290> my<00:06:31.470> opinion<00:06:31.740> I'm<00:06:32.550> sticking<00:06:32.850> with<00:06:32.970> it

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.640 

so<00:06:36.510> I<00:06:36.570> mean<00:06:36.720> it<00:06:36.810> does<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.050> same<00:06:37.110> thing<00:06:37.500> to

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
so I mean it does the same thing to

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.650 
so I mean it does the same thing to
either<00:06:37.860> either<00:06:38.430> theme<00:06:38.820> it<00:06:39.060> cuts<00:06:39.240> off<00:06:39.390> the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
either either theme it cuts off the

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.070 
either either theme it cuts off the
bottom<00:06:40.130> which<00:06:43.460> kind<00:06:44.460> of<00:06:44.610> screws<00:06:45.510> everyone<00:06:45.840> I'm

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
bottom which kind of screws everyone I'm

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.860 
bottom which kind of screws everyone I'm
paid<00:06:46.470> for<00:06:46.740> themes<00:06:47.510> because<00:06:48.510> you're<00:06:48.720> only
