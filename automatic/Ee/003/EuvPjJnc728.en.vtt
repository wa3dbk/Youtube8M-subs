00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.520
 and welcome the first part of a tutorial on how to solve the cube 6% 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.839
 who already watched my 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.719
 The other tutorials know that price has begun to teach resolution in 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.309
 second part 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.349
 in this first part had only a few tips 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.689
 some important things about this cube and history 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.099
 the first thing I will say 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.579
 are the cubes you need to know assemble 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.000
 I was soon able to set the set for 6 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.650
 three by three is required 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.430
 why all as bad as the layers above 3 in the park by 4% and so on 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.310
 against 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.210
 we first transform 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.910
 I'm sad, we solve it later. 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.830
 communication is by 3 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.120
 then the formulas or three by three 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 that we had to execute his career years as well 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.310
 took 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.200
 as performed 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.230
 for you it's ok 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.640
 otherwise the structure becomes really big 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.410
 because with many layers like that 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.740
 it's well done 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.970
 so to avoid several and various parts and it gets very dull 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.710
 I told you this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.210
 two other cubes 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 has entered 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.700
 very sweet sweet that I opened hand 4 by 4 5% 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.640
 the four by four why so 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.039
 the duck for 4 6 percent also has double layers pp 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.890
 and the whole body the number of layers 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 seems to have problems 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.620
 parity 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.130
 are cases 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.990
 here are very complicated to solve and generally school are very large 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.320
 and if you already knew at all with the flags of the 4por4 is much more 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 easy to stay other 6% 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 and the 5 by 5 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.000
 it is also another that would be illegal 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.410
 because we will use 5% techniques to complete 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 I'm the one here. 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.080
 when we have defined this well 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.830
 in the sixth in the story about the opponent 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.440
 but it would be another former prefect obligatory while coutinho by five is very 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.999
 It would be very business if you can hear them 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.329
 avoid problems and everything else 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.659
 something else is here 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.779
 as a prerequisite to dictate content by 34 and 45 per 5 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 so you had a certain skill 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 with one with your bike with the fly of the cubes 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.649
 story what I said in a way 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.679
 Let's sign the pec 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.029
 I went and I'll explain everything in detail 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.839
 the sooner he explains 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.329
 many details as to explain the available four by four 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.439
 that you choose the 5 by 5 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.089
 Otherwise 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.439
 this is another thing that would leave a very large tunnel 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.680
 culture is something very big and many practice dull sc too 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.249
 So this is another step I'll take. 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.249
 typical and quick but in a way that they can understand 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.669
 another important insightful thing covered people 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.859
 is the new mutation 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.869
 despite everything here our friends always form the police they 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.759
 in case of a new vote 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.059
 square did notice something like this 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.749
 I can 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.749
 is to apply them when you have never 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.889
 the notation is to follow 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.489
 the rounds 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.709
 the same thing t-shirts 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.029
 he 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.729
 the other 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:38.600
 the police 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.219
 and so on 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.459
 always capital letter 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.059
 now we have two comrades 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.029
 on them the launch date we will give the following hiring droughts 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.829
 when two layers were prefecture 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.619
 put as 2 in front of the lens 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.619
 I for example 2 r 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.879
 by grade 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.689
 and for me there are three layers 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.409
 the limestone three in front for example 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.839
 we train hard 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.199
 and 3 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.499
 three injured 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.310
 and when it is to make the same layer twice for example u2 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.670
 I would put in the middle after tel 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.610
 2 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.250
 u2 means at least two layers of sediment 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.479
 twice 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.849
 then number that comes before the law that represents the amount layers that 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.199
 you have to turn 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.799
 and if he has one or two then synopsis has taken the 6 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:48.870
 the ailment 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.229
 It's just that to explain. 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.559
 the first part of the real ceiling 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.009
 O 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.089
 I will leave the limit of the 2nd part description 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.879
 this mutation I would not put in the description of the video 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.069
 why that 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.099
 or will be target be Saturday 4 for 405 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.479
 then this one is also automatically 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.120
 when you 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.810
 when you learn if you do not need anything decorated 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.740
 efe norbert franke chile 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.669
 then yes video
