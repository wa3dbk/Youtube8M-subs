well the comment we hear over and over
again<00:03:01.300> is<00:03:01.510> how<00:03:01.630> clear<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.170> many<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:02.950> our

customers don't even realize that the

close<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.430> they<00:03:06.520> certainly<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.940> feel<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
close to it they certainly can feel the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.360 
close to it they certainly can feel the
time<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.989> reason<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.470> chose<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:09.040> build<00:03:09.160> our

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
time the reason we chose to build our

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.210 
time the reason we chose to build our
house<00:03:09.550> here<00:03:09.910> was<00:03:10.180> primarily<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.650> because<00:03:12.040> of

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
house here was primarily just because of

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.560 
house here was primarily just because of
the<00:03:12.310> views<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:12.880> we<00:03:12.910> didn't<00:03:13.150> want<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.360> have<00:03:13.450> to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
the views so we didn't want to have to

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.530 
the views so we didn't want to have to
block<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:15.010> windows<00:03:15.459> with<00:03:15.820> using<00:03:16.269> blinds

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
block the the windows with using blinds

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.900 
block the the windows with using blinds
or<00:03:16.840> anything<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.130> 3m<00:03:18.489> film

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
or anything like that so the 3m film

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.500 
or anything like that so the 3m film
helps<00:03:19.540> cut<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.709> heat<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> glare<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:21.790> it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
helps cut the heat and the glare but it

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.750 
helps cut the heat and the glare but it
also<00:03:22.720> keeps<00:03:23.380> our<00:03:23.560> view<00:03:23.800> nice<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.370> light

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
also keeps our view nice and light

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.140 
also keeps our view nice and light
open<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> Sun<00:03:26.170> does<00:03:26.439> flare<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.400> lot<00:03:27.760> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
open and the Sun does flare in a lot and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.539 
open and the Sun does flare in a lot and
if<00:03:28.569> this<00:03:29.049> room<00:03:29.349> has<00:03:29.890> kept<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.340> constant

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
if this room has kept a constant

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.140 
if this room has kept a constant
temperature<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.780> used<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.140> change<00:03:32.970> from<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
temperature it used to change from the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.270 
temperature it used to change from the
morning<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.900> afternoon<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.860> needs<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.189> get

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
morning to the afternoon it needs to get

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.339 
morning to the afternoon it needs to get
really<00:03:36.670> hot<00:03:36.909> in<00:03:37.090> here<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:37.569> it<00:03:37.689> does<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:38.079> stays

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
really hot in here so it does it stays

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.080 
really hot in here so it does it stays
very<00:03:38.439> comfortable<00:03:39.159> and<00:03:39.340> we're<00:03:39.909> really

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
very comfortable and we're really

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.250 
very comfortable and we're really
pleased<00:03:40.450> with<00:03:40.720> that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
pleased with that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.809 
pleased with that
although<00:03:41.620> these<00:03:41.769> films<00:03:42.040> were<00:03:42.099> quite<00:03:42.430> well<00:03:42.579> for
