beaten<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.210> there<00:01:49.390> in<00:01:49.480> New<00:01:49.600> Zealand

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
beaten is out there in New Zealand

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.760 
beaten is out there in New Zealand
well<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.690> last<00:01:52.690> count<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.260> heard<00:01:53.470> there<00:01:53.680> was

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
well this last count I heard there was

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.420 
well this last count I heard there was
about<00:01:53.950> three

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
about three

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.970 
about three
so<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.670> fairly<00:01:56.180> rare<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.450> unusual<00:01:56.660> car<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.800> is

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
so a fairly rare and unusual car it is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.100 
so a fairly rare and unusual car it is
the<00:01:58.190> see<00:01:58.460> as<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.150> go<00:01:59.300> up<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.600> leaders<00:01:59.930> with

around but there's still a pretty high
survival<00:02:06.920> rate<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.570> counter

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
good but they leave out some pretty

on<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.250> floor<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:41.880> quite<00:03:42.330> daunting<00:03:42.840> you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
on the floor it was quite daunting you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.360 
on the floor it was quite daunting you
think<00:03:43.470> well<00:03:43.620> where<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.010> hell<00:03:44.160> would<00:03:44.340> that

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
think well where the hell would that

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.890 
think well where the hell would that
piece<00:03:44.730> but<00:03:45.060> yes<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.850> consult<00:03:48.690> with

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
piece but yes so you do consult with

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.050 
piece but yes so you do consult with
people<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.950> think<00:03:50.160> know<00:03:50.490> these<00:03:50.730> things

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
people that you think know these things

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.230 
people that you think know these things
and<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.390> finishes<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.730> got<00:03:53.730> very<00:03:53.910> little

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
and it finishes up I got very little

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.200 
and it finishes up I got very little
information<00:03:54.510> from<00:03:55.200> others<00:03:55.770> about<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.970> you

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
information from others about what you

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.420 
information from others about what you
did<00:03:57.570> for<00:03:57.600> certain<00:03:58.230> problems<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.250> was

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
did for certain problems that I was

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.180 
did for certain problems that I was
striking<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.590> there's<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.710> say<00:04:01.860> they<00:04:02.040> came

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
striking and there's I say they came

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.590 
striking and there's I say they came
shaft<00:04:02.460> timing<00:04:02.880> was<00:04:03.000> one<00:04:03.210> of<00:04:03.330> them

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
shaft timing was one of them

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.100 
shaft timing was one of them
the<00:04:03.750> book<00:04:03.990> was<00:04:04.460> very<00:04:05.460> short<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:06.270> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
the book was very short on the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.310 
the book was very short on the
information<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.160> give<00:04:08.460> you<00:04:08.580> pages<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:10.020> to

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
information I give you pages on how to

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
information I give you pages on how to
do<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.710> but<00:04:10.890> did<00:04:11.100> not<00:04:11.130> tell<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:11.670> how<00:04:12.060> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
do it but did not tell you how to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.160 
do it but did not tell you how to
actually<00:04:12.510> do<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.170> timing<00:04:13.440> part<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:15.210> so

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
actually do the timing part of it and so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.500 
actually do the timing part of it and so
we<00:04:16.500> there<00:04:17.100> was<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.220> lot<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.430> trial<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.299> here<00:04:18.480> I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
we there was a lot of trial in here I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.110 
we there was a lot of trial in here I
know<00:04:19.970> one<00:04:20.970> good<00:04:21.150> friend<00:04:21.330> of<00:04:21.570> mine<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:23.120> said

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
know one good friend of mine here said

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.490 
know one good friend of mine here said
that<00:04:24.150> everything<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.840> do<00:04:25.020> on<00:04:25.170> a<00:04:25.200> Bentley

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
that everything you do on a Bentley

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.210 
that everything you do on a Bentley
engine<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.460> do<00:04:26.610> three<00:04:26.970> times<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.950> thought

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
engine you do three times and I thought

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.180 
engine you do three times and I thought
yeah<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:30.270> not<00:04:30.450> quite<00:04:30.720> right<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.860> five

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
yeah that's not quite right it's five

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.540 
yeah that's not quite right it's five
times<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:34.320> do<00:04:34.500> one<00:04:34.770> thing<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.220> make<00:04:35.400> an

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
times and to do one thing and make an

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.640 
times and to do one thing and make an
adjustment<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:36.210> had<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.630> undo<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.290> whole<00:04:37.470> lot

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
adjustment you had to undo a whole lot

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.830 
adjustment you had to undo a whole lot
of<00:04:37.770> previous<00:04:38.010> things<00:04:38.550> you've<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:39.000> done<00:04:39.240> make

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
of previous things you've just done make

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.330 
of previous things you've just done make
the<00:04:40.020> adjustment<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.620> Porter<00:04:41.010> all<00:04:41.130> back

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
the adjustment and Porter all back

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.920 
the adjustment and Porter all back
together<00:04:41.490> going<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.090> see<00:04:42.330> whether<00:04:42.540> you've<00:04:42.810> got

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
together going to see whether you've got

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.610 
together going to see whether you've got
the<00:04:42.960> adjustment<00:04:43.590> right<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:46.350> was<00:04:46.560> very

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
the adjustment right and so it was very

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.000 
the adjustment right and so it was very
time-consuming<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:48.390> name<00:04:48.660> Daniel<00:04:49.440> obvious

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
time-consuming the name Daniel obvious

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.560 
time-consuming the name Daniel obvious
was<00:04:50.760> supposed<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.000> be<00:04:51.090> out<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.360> world's

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
was supposed to be out of the world's

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.500 
was supposed to be out of the world's
best<00:04:52.230> vintage<00:04:52.800> touring<00:04:53.190> cars<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.760> you're

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
best vintage touring cars so you're

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.690 
best vintage touring cars so you're
taking<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:54.990> enjoying<00:04:55.290> it<00:04:55.530> yes<00:04:56.130> well

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
it was three days of cleaning which is

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.059 
it was three days of cleaning which is
all<00:05:02.150> undone<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.110> about<00:05:03.409> half<00:05:03.770> an<00:05:03.949> hour

yesterday but no it's good it's a it's a
very<00:05:08.000> interesting<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:09.319> almost<00:05:09.620> exciting<00:05:10.400> car

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
very interesting and almost exciting car

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.830 
very interesting and almost exciting car
to<00:05:10.819> drive<00:05:12.220> because<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.580> guess<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:14.000> goes<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.659> lot

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
to drive because I guess that goes a lot

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.200 
to drive because I guess that goes a lot
faster<00:05:15.470> perhaps<00:05:15.979> at<00:05:16.159> the<00:05:16.310> average<00:05:16.789> vintage

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
faster perhaps at the average vintage

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.140 
faster perhaps at the average vintage
car<00:05:17.889> that's<00:05:18.889> not<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.129> reason<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.520> ever<00:05:19.789> existed

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
car that's not the reason I ever existed

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.839 
car that's not the reason I ever existed
it<00:05:20.750> it's<00:05:21.470> different<00:05:21.710> but<00:05:22.400> certainly<00:05:22.669> one<00:05:22.819> of

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
it it's different but certainly one of

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.309 
it it's different but certainly one of
the<00:05:22.970> added<00:05:23.210> bonuses<00:05:23.569> of<00:05:23.720> having<00:05:23.960> won<00:05:24.080> one<00:05:24.289> of

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
the added bonuses of having won one of

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.510 
the added bonuses of having won one of
the<00:05:24.500> better<00:05:24.650> cars<00:05:24.949> of<00:05:25.099> the<00:05:25.190> era

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
the better cars of the era

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.790 
the better cars of the era
I<00:05:25.669> suppose<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.539> could<00:05:26.750> say<00:05:26.780> some<00:05:27.259> some<00:05:27.650> may

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
I suppose you could say some some may

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.279 
I suppose you could say some some may
not<00:05:28.009> agree<00:05:28.280> with<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:28.759> I<00:05:28.909> mean<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:29.690> get<00:05:29.870> eat<00:05:30.050> and

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
not agree with it I mean you get eat and

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.529 
not agree with it I mean you get eat and
he<00:05:30.710> claimed<00:05:31.009> her<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.340> world's<00:05:31.669> fastest<00:05:32.210> lorry

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
he claimed her the world's fastest lorry

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.080 
he claimed her the world's fastest lorry
so<00:05:33.409> we<00:05:33.800> never<00:05:33.979> allow<00:05:34.370> ourselves<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.940> be

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
so we never allow ourselves to be

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.959 
so we never allow ourselves to be
possible<00:05:35.569> I<00:05:35.599> feel<00:05:35.870> guilty<00:05:36.969> fortunately

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
possible I feel guilty fortunately

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:39.189 
possible I feel guilty fortunately
there's<00:05:38.180> not<00:05:38.300> meaning<00:05:38.719> around<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.080> won't

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
there's not meaning around I won't

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.140
