 from npd and this time i have no 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.630
 smartphone or no camera 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.640
 but stand next to the sony kriegs 1 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.010
 this is a full camera without im 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.380
 framework of ifa 2014 is and is 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.760
 a follower of the comic scene 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.770
 but much higher quality 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.269
 high quality at this cure x1 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.250
 Camera is the fact that we are here 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.840
 i have an e mount system 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.239
 Any objectively on the out of the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.519
 Home sony on this camera on lance 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.829
 no matter how big the focal length is me 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.210
 but also the possibility of objective 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.829
 from other companies like for example 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.020
 nikon or canon then attach 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.430
 however, by means of an adapter 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.070
 Of course optional and additionally in the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.129
 trade available right now is the whole 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.390
 coupled with a sony xperia z3 the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.690
 The coupling can either via wlan 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.760
 or even over nfc 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.219
 compatible with ios and devices and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.170
 you see this skipass with the 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.140
 By this lug is the whole then 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.820
 attached to the sony xperia z3 here 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.259
 now have the opportunity to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.900
 of course I then focus in that 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.850
 here on the display had and also the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.350
 possibility of triggering the photo 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.210
 that will be right then on the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.119
 doku coupled device that is in 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.250
 this falls the sony xperia z3 filed 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.450
 if we look at the left side 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.330
 then this is actually the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 most interesting side of cow x1 because 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.049
 Here I do not just have the trigger 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.150
 button or a separate trigger 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.950
 Button with which I then take pictures 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.869
 but can also be one up here 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 small trigger with it so a little one 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.600
 Shit out will not be so too 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.579
 videos or photo 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 in low light conditions 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.079
 As the recording is done with full 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.810
 hd that is 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.180
 accordingly very high resolution 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.890
 sorry, swyx 1 does not support here 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.080
 I have the possibility but also comes 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.180
 objectively to zoom back to at on 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 about one over this tricycle 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.920
 or via this election 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.630
 put 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.369
 and I have the opportunity 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.439
 internal battery with this mini usb 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.729
 connection socket to load 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.740
 deduct accordingly 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.689
 The battery is empty interchangeable that is 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.069
 i can out of any other sony camera 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.509
 for example, this battery there 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.080
 what last year not the insert 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.600
 case was 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.060
 because you could only as far as I know 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.830
 insert batteries 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 if I can do it all again and 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.390
 go to the other side again 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.270
 we can guess that I'm down here 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.160
 underneath a micro sd card slot 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.620
 that means i can do this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.880
 completely autarkic use system for me 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.490
 have the possibility synonymous without 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.170
 smartphone or without tablet pc's 1 too 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.630
 i know i just take this 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.730
 Camera module, it can me, for example, by means of 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.410
 a bend to every possible 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.700
 can then make it through the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.230
 run world history and then easy 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.210
 take pictures then they will be on 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.010
 stored on the device and in the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.690
 later course you can then this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.700
 photos of course then on a tablet or 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.170
 pull a smartphone or a notebook 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.930
 that was it with a short first 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.070
 impression of the so nico x1 many thanks 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.070
