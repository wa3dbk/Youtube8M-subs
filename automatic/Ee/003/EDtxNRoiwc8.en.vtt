00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 once the people who foretold the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.990
 end of the world was locked up or 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.809
 mocked or both things not there 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 we took seriously maybe we would 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.630
 due but I'm running too much better now 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 start from the beginning of abduction of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.000
 desmond miles my son he didn't have 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 ambition or purpose 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 no plans for the future but had a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.189
 heavy heritage and wanted to ignore it for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.070
 this risked his life was 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.070
 taken and imprisoned the kidnappers wanted 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.980
 that he would help them find something 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 the apple one of the many artifacts called 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 the fruit of the gangs remains of an ancient one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.590
 technology was scattered around the globe 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 some hidden others not but all 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.719
 almost all were dangerous in the hands 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.500
 of a group the same people who stone 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.260
 disassemble are known as abstergo 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.080
 industrious for us are the Templars the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 we fight against them from thousands of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.869
 years 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.820
 even more for those who believe in history 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.760
 of their origin like me after all 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.759
 I know the truth this is the beauty and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.530
 the horror of the animus a machine there 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.020
 lets you relive the lives of our people 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100
 ancestors who has the power to change 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.140
 all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.869
 to show us the story how it went 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 really until its creation a 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.409
 writing the story were the winners 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 we want to remedy and free the minds and 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.939
 bodies but we can't do more than 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.330
 so much are the Templars to be in 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.940
 advantage now but something bigger 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.890
 that assassins and Templars are approaching is 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.750
 bigger than all of us and if not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.990
 we find the way to stop it these 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.119
 will be the last weeks of life for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.159
 all humanity 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.200
 in the end it all boils down to desmo 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.000
 in the soul knows discovered its origins has 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 lived the life of his ancestors e 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 their secrets revealed 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.479
 did this he trained he used a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 another ancestor to acquire decades of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.239
 experience in a few days worked 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.370
 we believe and hopefully soon though 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.459
 we find out 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 the ominous date is approaching December 21st 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.390
 2012 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.840
 none of us knows what will happen except 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.409
 that they wanted us to find each other 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.010
 exactly here they drove in 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:36.379
 their way dark and frustrated with the voices 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.620
 of the first civilization of those who 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.650
 klina was an ancient supreme race 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.340
 power and their strange ambitions 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.980
 have created the fruits of the races there 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.290
 they have led children and with him too 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.319
 and at the entrance of this place 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.620
 forgotten armed with the knowledge of altair 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.200
 and the skills they have in their hands 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.170
 the apple of the Eden and we are at his 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.060
 side ready to help him if he had any 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 need is called desmond miles and has us 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 guided to the end
