00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.959
Today I want to talk about curled toes or
what are often called "hammer toes."

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.590
That's just a situation where the toe is curled
in some way.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.570
Now, the hammer toe itself doesn't really
cause pain.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.910
What can cause pain is this can push up against
the top of the shoe and that pressure can

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.910
be painful.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.740
It can cause a corn, and that can be painful.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.160
It can also, as it goes up here, can shove
this metatarsal bone down into the shoe, and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.220
it can cause pain on the bottom of the foot.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.010
You can also end up walking on the tip of
your toe instead of the bottom of the toe,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.300
and that can cause pain at the tip of the
toe.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.050
This can really be a painful problem but usually
fairly easy to treat.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.600
You really want to avoid surgery if you can.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.420
Sometimes surgery is necessary.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.989
The problem with doing toe surgery is that
the tendons that go into these toes start

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.790
from one common muscle and go to all of the
toes.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.440
If we go in, we do a surgery on, let's say,
the second toe, you might find that three

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.680
or four or ten years down the line, all the
sudden you've got this third toe pulling up

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.130
or the fourth toe pulling up.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.430
It's a little unpredictable.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.890
We would recommend that surgery should be
your very last resort.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.939
A majority of cases, probably well over 90%
of the cases that we see, we can treat these

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.789
hammer toes without surgery.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.369
Our primary goal is to get the pressure off
those areas that are painful.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.880
We might just give you some shoe modifications,
and that might mean even for women, there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.210
are some very attractive high-heeled shoes
that you can wear that won't put nearly the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.319
pressure on these toes.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.119
There's a lot of different shoe modifications
or recommendations that we can do.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.109
We can look at stretching of the shoes.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.409
There are certain pads you can use that, when
you wear them, will help straighten out the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.409
toes.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.119
Now, in the case that you've tried all conservative
treatment, and you're really having pain that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.389
limits your activity, or for example, limits
your ability to exercise, then we may consider

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:45.389
surgery.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.369
This shows what that surgery is.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.229
Here's the hammer toe.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.779
We would take off a little bit of the cartilage
at this joint here on either side, and then

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.310
you fuse that joint straight.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.740
Again, the surgery is fairly simple and usually,
most people have a great outcome initially.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.090
It's just a little unpredictable what might
happen down the road.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.590
We highly [suggest 00:02:06] avoiding them
if you can.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.360
If you're in our area, please come see us
if you have hammer toes.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.150
We can help you find treatment that would
get rid of your pain and almost always avoid

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.150
surgery.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.170
If you're not in our area, try and find a
podiatrist that specializes in biomechanics

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.920
they might have that specialize in orthopedic
therapy or sports medicine.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.650
Those are the ones that usually will be best
at helping you avoid surgery on these problems.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.569
But again, don't live with the pain.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.140
It's usually pretty easy to treat.
