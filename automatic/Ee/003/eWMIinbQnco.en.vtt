00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
the cover the next thing we're gonna do

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.819 
the cover the next thing we're gonna do
um<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.390> connector<00:01:49.350> share<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
um the the connector share have a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.850 
um the the connector share have a
housing<00:01:50.610> over<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.420 

get<00:01:55.860> away<00:01:55.950> Josiah<00:01:56.430> move<00:01:57.890> don't<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.010> leaving<00:01:59.220> on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
get away Josiah move don't be leaving on

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
get away Josiah move don't be leaving on
the<00:01:59.520> car<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> down<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:03.980> that<00:02:04.980> this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the car is down and then that this

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200 
the car is down and then that this
housing<00:02:05.760> will<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:05.910> clamped<00:02:06.450> onto<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.930> here

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
housing will be clamped onto right here

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.180 
housing will be clamped onto right here
so<00:02:09.210> pretty<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:10.020> pull<00:02:10.710> it<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so pretty much you just pull it off and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
so pretty much you just pull it off and
unclamp<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.840> I'm<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.110> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
unclamp it so the way I'm going to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
unclamp it so the way I'm going to
connect<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.830> I'm<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> disconnect<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
connect this I'm going to disconnect the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.020 
connect this I'm going to disconnect the
power<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.910> module<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> light<00:02:21.990> module

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
power to the module or the light module

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.510 
power to the module or the light module
or<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.540> these<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:24.990> all<00:02:25.110> for<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> LEDs<00:02:25.830> this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
or here these are all for the LEDs this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.650 
or here these are all for the LEDs this
um<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.390> only<00:02:27.630> supports<00:02:28.170> LED<00:02:28.590> lights<00:02:29.660> nothing

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
um this only supports LED lights nothing

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.060 
um this only supports LED lights nothing
else

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.010 
you how to run the wire I'm just going
to<00:02:36.720> splice<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.380> wire<00:02:37.709> here<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.930> I'm

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
to splice this wire here and then I'm

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.330 
to splice this wire here and then I'm
going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> splice<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.740> wire

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
going to splice this wire

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.100 
going to splice this wire
I<00:02:41.370> started<00:02:41.850> me<00:02:41.970> cutting<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.390> connection<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.080> I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
I started me cutting the connection so I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.680 
I started me cutting the connection so I
can<00:02:43.290> still<00:02:43.530> use<00:02:43.680> them<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> case<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.690> don't

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
can still use them for a case I don't

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.560 
can still use them for a case I don't
want<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:45.990> using<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:47.000> flash<00:02:48.000> mode<00:02:48.270> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
want to be using the flash mode of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.330 
want to be using the flash mode of
module<00:02:49.020> thing<00:02:49.200> anymore<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:51.140> let<00:02:52.140> me<00:02:52.340> connect

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
module thing anymore so let me connect

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.400 
module thing anymore so let me connect
them<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.000> show<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.330> how<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> did<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.930> because

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
I'm going to use T taps to do it so I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.770 
I'm going to use T taps to do it so I
want<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.440> cutting<00:02:58.709> no<00:02:58.830> wires<00:03:02.060> okay<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.600> is

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
want to be cutting no wires okay this is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.850 
want to be cutting no wires okay this is
the<00:03:04.019> first<00:03:04.590> side<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.610> I'm<00:03:05.760> clipping<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the first side that I'm clipping on the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.280 
the first side that I'm clipping on the
brown<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.400> negative<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:10.080> loom

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
brown is negative the on your loom

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.750 
brown is negative the on your loom
blacks<00:03:10.590> positive<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:14.610> right

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
blacks positive as you can see right

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.910 
blacks positive as you can see right
there<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:17.239> connector<00:03:18.650> has<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.739> wishes

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
there and connector has a as it wishes

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.080 
there and connector has a as it wishes
in<00:03:27.110> right<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.680> N<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.040> then<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.670> has<00:03:29.820> out

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
in right this is N and then it has out

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.520 
in right this is N and then it has out
right<00:03:30.570> here<00:03:30.830> let<00:03:31.830> me<00:03:31.860> get<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.489> better

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.190 

so<00:03:40.250> once<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.570> other<00:03:41.660> side<00:03:41.960> says

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
so once it's in and the other side says

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800 
so once it's in and the other side says
L<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.250> now<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.640> going<00:03:43.790> out<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> left

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
L so now it's going out to the left

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.710 
L so now it's going out to the left
bottom<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:46.490> it's<00:03:46.670> coming<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.180> from<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.480> cart

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
bottom so it's coming in from the cart

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.330 
bottom so it's coming in from the cart
the<00:03:47.990> powers<00:03:48.290> coming<00:03:48.320> in<00:03:48.650> from<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.890> car<00:03:49.130> and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the powers coming in from the car and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.730 
the powers coming in from the car and
you're<00:03:49.460> going<00:03:49.730> out<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.240> light<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.470> let<00:03:51.650> me

you're going out to the light so let me

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.700 
you're going out to the light so let me
connect<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.220> side<00:03:53.050> as<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.230> can<00:03:54.380> see<00:03:54.530> home

connect this side as you can see home
connecting

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.800 

okay<00:03:59.450> now<00:03:59.660> I'm<00:03:59.900> all<00:04:00.110> done<00:04:00.350> as<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.100> can<00:04:01.130> see<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
okay now I'm all done as you can see the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.600 
okay now I'm all done as you can see the
blue<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:04.420> positive<00:04:05.420> brown<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.930> negative<00:04:06.610> black

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
blue is positive brown is negative black

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.030 
blue is positive brown is negative black
yellow<00:04:07.940> positive<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.990> then<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.800> browns

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
yellow positive and then the browns

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:27.280 
yellow positive and then the browns
negative<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:25.030> here's<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.120> switch<00:04:26.480> power<00:04:27.050> look

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
negative so here's a switch power look

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.310 
negative so here's a switch power look
like<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.550> axle<00:04:29.120> name<00:04:29.390> of<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.750> or<00:04:29.990> the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
like this is the axle name of it or the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.810 
like this is the axle name of it or the
model<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:33.410> focus<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:35.240> model<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:37.370> actually

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
model to focus the model is is actually

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.980 
model to focus the model is is actually
the<00:04:38.000> GS<00:04:40.270> 1/100<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.390> a<00:04:41.680> right<00:04:42.680> here<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:44.810> is

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
the GS 1/100 and a right here so this is

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.730 
the GS 1/100 and a right here so this is
the<00:04:45.110> one<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.410> flashes<00:04:45.919> like<00:04:46.190> um<00:04:47.740> rapidly
