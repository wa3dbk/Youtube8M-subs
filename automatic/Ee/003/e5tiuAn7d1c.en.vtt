00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.620
 What to say about the first impressions of the 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.450
 are and hesperia z3 compact good what 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.089
 first I would refer to everything we have 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.839
 counted sony xperia z 3 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.570
 practically twin brother the most 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.519
 important of this model is that it is not 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.850
 the genre of the mini the genre in the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.740
 that from a high-end take a phone 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.570
 smaller but with features 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.609
 much worse not the bet here of sony 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.130
 it's still a smaller phone 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.630
 but again in the in the high- end and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.970
 therefore they were a lot of what we have 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.420
 said already from 2010 eta 3 as an aspect 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.190
 as the pass to ips 68 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.079
 the latest generation micro of which 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.940
 with the 16 gb of memory 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.159
 many aspects or capacity 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.949
 even from the client of the ps4 what 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.399
 we keep maintaining in the xperia z3 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.399
 company 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.930
 that we would highlight in every way of this 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 model in particular in principle the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.190
 colors change and we move to a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 possibility of having four colors is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.360
 blank is in red 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.540
 we have this mint green is in black 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.430
 also and a fundamental aspect of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.280
 size and design that we see in the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.409
 farewell of compact theaters in the same 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.200
 size that we had in the z1 compact 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.030
 we went from 4.3 to 4.6 inches that is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 it's still a pretty phone 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.890
 compact as its name says but to the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 you get good with that cut in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.100
 frames with that thinning that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.020
 is getting sound in its high-end 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.910
 get enough screen 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.540
 when about 6 inches is enough 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.400
 respectable 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.870
 the decision you have made are and so on 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.710
 with the screen keeps it on 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.460
 hd resolution in 720p and does not jump to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.490
 the 2.080 as is usual in the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.920
 high end this good decision always 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.350
 we will have that debate if the size of 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 Screen has reduced it's worth it 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.130
 greatly increase the resolution is true 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.690
 that in 4.3 inches we saw a lot 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 reasonable that they are and would not have given that 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.010
 jump but with 4.6 inches already good 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.229
 it starts is on the border where 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.930
 one seems that could start demanded 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.270
 high range be in full hd in all 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.490
 case this screen of less resolution 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 probably results in autonomy 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.050
 pretty high on the phone that I eat 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.959
 We will always have to try 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.480
 conditions of use of more time in 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.120
 design there is another change also receiving 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.000
 the to the high range and that is on the side 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.450
 the aluminum finish is dispensed with and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 you bet on this kind of plastic 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.770
 polycarbonate with nylon explanation and 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.380
 what is the composition of the material and what 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.300
 it gives a slightly different impression fides 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370
 even though it 's a bit outgoing towards 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.720
 outside 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.140
 visually with a corporal instead of 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.630
 context in any case the finish let's say 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.190
 it's not so premium they are not that high 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.380
 as in 73 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.270
 it also has less ram the subject that I 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.120
 thrills the screen but in the rest 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.670
 of component functions is a high-end 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.709
 with all the rally class 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.750
 in short to all who like 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.500
 1 Compact oil will love 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.120
 I think the c3 that yes personally 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.099
 he liked lime green more than green 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.520
 mint but good is already a matter of 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.520
 design and we definitely see that the z1 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.380
 compact because I got that from having a 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.350
 high-end android in one size more 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.410
 reduced manageable with one hand and the 73 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 compact that improves it still good 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.890
 let's say now it's a bit more difficult 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.739
 handle with one hand because the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.420
 diagonal has grown from the screen but 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.750
 It is definitely a pretty product 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.670
 improved compared to the remarkable one that already 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.370
 he had sony with his small phone 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.959
 definitive if we continue looking for range 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.540
 high in small size it seems that the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.480
 race right now be between 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.440
 this sony bet and the presumed the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.060
 presumed samsung samsung galaxy alpha that 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.209
 we also hope to see in this 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.209
 iphone
