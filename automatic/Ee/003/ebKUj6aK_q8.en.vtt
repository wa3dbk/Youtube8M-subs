00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
most of them don't have or any of them

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.289 
most of them don't have or any of them
I've<00:01:44.040> done<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> research<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.060> haven't

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I've done some of the research I haven't

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.880 
I've done some of the research I haven't
found<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.509> yet<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.899> does<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
found one yet that does have a

found one yet that does have a

Diagnostics port the Diagnostics port

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.069 
Diagnostics port the Diagnostics port
are<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> little<00:01:49.770> ports<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.270> mechanic

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
are the little ports that your mechanic

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
are the little ports that your mechanic
will<00:01:52.229> plug<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.670> getting<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
will plug up to when you're getting a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.999 
will plug up to when you're getting a
smog<00:01:54.450> check<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:55.500> reading<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
smog check or when they're reading the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.889 
smog check or when they're reading the
the<00:01:56.280> information<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.479> check<00:01:57.659> engine

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the information that your check engine

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.690 
the information that your check engine
light<00:01:58.229> puts<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.930> zubi<00:02:01.259> key

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
light puts out so this is the zubi key

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
light puts out so this is the zubi key
once<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.210> plugged<00:02:03.540> into<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.960> car

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
once you have this plugged into your car

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
once you have this plugged into your car

diagnostic information from the computer

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.050 
diagnostic information from the computer
in<00:05:17.470> your<00:05:17.590> car<00:05:17.830> remember<00:05:18.490> this<00:05:18.610> is<00:05:18.820> plugged

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
in your car remember this is plugged

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.940 
in your car remember this is plugged
into<00:05:19.300> your<00:05:19.360> diagnostic<00:05:20.110> port<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:20.590> when<00:05:20.800> that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
into your diagnostic port so when that

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.010 
into your diagnostic port so when that
check<00:05:21.190> engine<00:05:21.460> light<00:05:21.760> comes<00:05:22.000> on<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.750> will

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
check engine light comes on it will

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.920 
check engine light comes on it will
actually<00:05:23.289> tell<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.860> what<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:24.970> error<00:05:25.150> code<00:05:25.539> is

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
actually tell you what the error code is

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.469 
actually tell you what the error code is
what<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.770> means<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.669> actually<00:05:28.060> provides

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
what it means and it actually provides

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.810 
what it means and it actually provides
based<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.199> some<00:05:29.530> statistical<00:05:30.370> data<00:05:30.580> it

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
based on some statistical data it

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.900 
based on some statistical data it
compiles<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.960> average<00:05:32.620> cost<00:05:33.010> of<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.520> repair

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
compiles the average cost of that repair

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.820 
compiles the average cost of that repair
so<00:05:34.450> when<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.780> check<00:05:34.990> engine<00:05:35.200> light<00:05:35.470> comes<00:05:35.680> on

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
so when the check engine light comes on

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.990 
so when the check engine light comes on
and<00:05:35.889> let's<00:05:36.130> say<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.280> have<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.460> bad<00:05:36.700> Oh<00:05:36.940> to

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
and let's say you have a bad Oh to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.279 
and let's say you have a bad Oh to
sensor<00:05:37.539> it's<00:05:37.660> actually<00:05:37.900> going<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.080> show<00:05:38.229> you

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
sensor it's actually going to show you

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.529 
sensor it's actually going to show you
that<00:05:38.860> you<00:05:39.010> have<00:05:39.039> a<00:05:39.190> bad<00:05:39.400> or<00:05:39.550> -<00:05:39.760> sensor<00:05:40.150> it's

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
that you have a bad or - sensor it's

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.089 
that you have a bad or - sensor it's
going<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.780> show<00:05:40.930> you<00:05:40.990> based<00:05:41.350> on<00:05:41.500> mechanics<00:05:42.010> in

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
going to show you based on mechanics in

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.040 
going to show you based on mechanics in
your<00:05:42.220> area<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.610> that<00:05:42.940> may<00:05:43.360> cost<00:05:43.599> anywhere

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
your area that that may cost anywhere

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.719 
your area that that may cost anywhere
from<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.590> hundred<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:45.099> two<00:05:45.220> hundred<00:05:45.250> I'm<00:05:45.580> just

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
from a hundred to two hundred I'm just

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.460 
from a hundred to two hundred I'm just
making<00:05:45.970> that<00:05:46.060> up<00:05:46.120> so<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:46.840> know<00:05:47.020> how<00:05:47.169> it<00:05:47.289> works

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
making that up so you know how it works

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.290 
making that up so you know how it works
there's<00:05:48.099> actually<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.550> feature<00:05:48.880> in<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.270> app

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
there's actually a feature in the app

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.620 
there's actually a feature in the app
which<00:05:49.810> allows<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.440> turn<00:05:51.280> on<00:05:51.340> a<00:05:51.849> motion

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
which allows you to turn on a motion

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.400 
which allows you to turn on a motion
sensing<00:05:53.849> ability<00:05:54.849> that<00:05:55.300> will<00:05:55.630> alert<00:05:56.229> you

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
sensing ability that will alert you

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.980 
sensing ability that will alert you
immediately<00:05:57.190> if<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.849> car<00:05:58.060> moves<00:05:58.479> when<00:05:58.780> it<00:05:58.900> was

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
immediately if the car moves when it was

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.629 
immediately if the car moves when it was
supposed<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.410> be<00:05:59.620> still<00:05:59.979> so<00:06:00.340> that's

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
supposed to be still so that's

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.490 
supposed to be still so that's
definitely<00:06:00.880> a<00:06:01.270> very<00:06:01.690> cool<00:06:01.960> feature<00:06:02.169> you'll

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
definitely a very cool feature you'll

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.920 
definitely a very cool feature you'll
want<00:06:02.830> to<00:06:02.889> check<00:06:03.250> out<00:06:03.460> if<00:06:03.669> your<00:06:04.120> car<00:06:04.330> gets<00:06:04.360> towed

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
want to check out if your car gets towed

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.980 
want to check out if your car gets towed
it<00:06:05.380> will<00:06:05.860> not<00:06:06.190> register<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.210> only<00:06:07.599> if<00:06:07.840> the

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
it will not register that only if the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.680 
it will not register that only if the
car<00:06:08.169> is<00:06:08.260> actually<00:06:08.620> turned<00:06:08.889> on<00:06:09.160> and<00:06:09.599> you<00:06:10.599> know

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
car is actually turned on and you know

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.870 
car is actually turned on and you know
broken<00:06:11.050> it<00:06:11.169> into<00:06:11.380> and<00:06:11.740> turned<00:06:11.950> on<00:06:12.130> will<00:06:12.460> that

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
broken it into and turned on will that

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.360 
broken it into and turned on will that
feature<00:06:13.150> kick<00:06:13.510> in<00:06:13.690> they<00:06:14.440> did<00:06:14.770> say<00:06:14.979> however<00:06:15.130> on

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
feature kick in they did say however on

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.379 
feature kick in they did say however on
the<00:06:15.460> website<00:06:15.760> that<00:06:15.910> they're<00:06:16.000> working<00:06:16.120> on

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
the website that they're working on

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.900 
the website that they're working on
adding<00:06:16.720> that<00:06:17.229> in<00:06:17.410> at<00:06:17.530> some<00:06:17.740> future<00:06:17.919> time<00:06:18.310> being

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
adding that in at some future time being

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.540 
adding that in at some future time being
able<00:06:19.000> to<00:06:19.120> detect<00:06:19.450> if<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.690> car<00:06:19.840> is<00:06:19.930> being<00:06:20.139> towed

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
able to detect if the car is being towed

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.850 
able to detect if the car is being towed
so<00:06:21.550> at<00:06:21.669> the<00:06:21.789> end<00:06:21.970> of<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.180> day<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:23.320> gives<00:06:23.710> you

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
so at the end of the day it gives you

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.850 
so at the end of the day it gives you
actionable<00:06:24.370> information<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.560> can

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
actionable information that you can

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.820 
actionable information that you can
actually<00:06:27.130> use<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:28.030> determine<00:06:28.530> how<00:06:29.530> quickly

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
actually use to determine how quickly

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.180 
actually use to determine how quickly
you<00:06:30.160> may<00:06:30.310> need<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.580> get<00:06:30.700> your<00:06:30.880> car<00:06:31.030> for<00:06:31.360> repairs

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
you may need to get your car for repairs

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.469 
you may need to get your car for repairs
if<00:06:33.190> you<00:06:33.550> need<00:06:33.729> to<00:06:33.820> change<00:06:34.030> your<00:06:34.270> driving
