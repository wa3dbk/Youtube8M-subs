00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
slowing down at just a bit but like I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.200 
slowing down at just a bit but like I
said<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.979> know<00:00:52.100> bump<00:00:52.339> down<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.640> resolution

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
said you know bump down the resolution

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.710 
said you know bump down the resolution
of<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.659> should<00:00:53.839> be<00:00:53.869> fine<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.769> that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
of it and you should be fine on that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.140 
of it and you should be fine on that
playing<00:00:56.720> at<00:00:56.869> 640<00:00:57.379> by<00:00:57.530> 480<00:00:57.979> I<00:00:58.220> think<00:00:58.549> whatever

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
playing at 640 by 480 I think whatever

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.569 
playing at 640 by 480 I think whatever
it<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.739> actually<00:01:00.739> makes<00:01:00.890> me<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.129> whole<00:01:01.400> lot

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it is actually makes me a whole lot

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.549 
it is actually makes me a whole lot
faster<00:01:01.790> you<00:01:02.629> can<00:01:02.750> play<00:01:02.930> without<00:01:03.170> any<00:01:03.350> lag

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
faster you can play without any lag

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.980 
faster you can play without any lag
whatsoever<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:05.210> then<00:01:05.509> actually<00:01:05.810> one<00:01:05.930> is

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
whatsoever and then actually one is

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.969 
whatsoever and then actually one is
pretty<00:01:06.170> smooth<00:01:07.540> as<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.930> see<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:09.409> one<00:01:09.680> is

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
pretty smooth as you can see this one is

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.179 
pretty smooth as you can see this one is
pretty<00:01:10.189> quickly<00:01:10.520> right<00:01:10.820> here<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.710> know<00:01:12.710> for<00:01:13.159> a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
pretty quickly right here I know for a

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.410 
pretty quickly right here I know for a
fact<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.729> moment<00:01:13.880> we're<00:01:14.119> gonna<00:01:14.180> have<00:01:14.360> a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
fact that in a moment we're gonna have a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.740 
fact that in a moment we're gonna have a
pretty<00:01:14.630> big<00:01:14.869> explosion<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:16.090> drops<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.299> FPS

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
pretty big explosion like drops the FPS

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.850 
pretty big explosion like drops the FPS
student<00:01:18.259> saying<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.159> low<00:01:19.460> amount<00:01:20.050> but<00:01:21.050> like<00:01:21.830> I

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
student saying the low amount but like I

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.950 
student saying the low amount but like I
said<00:01:22.070> one<00:01:22.909> of<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.060> problems<00:01:23.390> I'm<00:01:23.510> also<00:01:23.690> having

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
said one of the problems I'm also having

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.250 
said one of the problems I'm also having
with<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.700> speed<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.000> game<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.479> just<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
with the speed of the game is just the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.770 
with the speed of the game is just the
camera<00:01:27.830> recorder<00:01:28.280> because<00:01:29.180> I'm<00:01:29.300> finding<00:01:29.510> that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
camera recorder because I'm finding that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.890 
camera recorder because I'm finding that
you<00:01:29.990> know<00:01:30.610> camstudio<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.909> slowing<00:01:32.659> down<00:01:32.690> my

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
you know camstudio is slowing down my

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.250 
you know camstudio is slowing down my
FPS<00:01:33.350> quite<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.650> bit<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.190> could<00:01:34.520> be<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
FPS quite a bit and that could be a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.899 
FPS quite a bit and that could be a
graphical<00:01:36.260> problem<00:01:36.620> once<00:01:36.890> again<00:01:37.010> bump<00:01:37.760> down

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
graphical problem once again bump down

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.490 
graphical problem once again bump down
the<00:01:38.060> FPS<00:01:38.479> don't<00:01:38.840> be<00:01:38.900> running<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> camera

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500

uh you know what I said you changed the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.220 
uh you know what I said you changed the
resolution<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.909> that<00:02:32.030> seems<00:02:32.930> actually

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
resolution and that seems actually

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.630 
resolution and that seems actually
pretty<00:02:33.590> fluid<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.220> shouldn't<00:02:34.430> have<00:02:34.519> any

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
pretty fluid you shouldn't have any

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.390 
pretty fluid you shouldn't have any
problems<00:02:35.000> with<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.650> well<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.190> for

counter-strike hope that there's an idea

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.630 
counter-strike hope that there's an idea
of<00:02:40.819> how<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.060> runs<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:41.480> machine<00:02:41.629> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
of how it runs in this machine and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.879 
of how it runs in this machine and
