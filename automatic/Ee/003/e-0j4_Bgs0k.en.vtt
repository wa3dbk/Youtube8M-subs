 It is the set of pieces 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.149
 responsible for driving the exhaust gases offering the most minimum 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.609

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.609
 before unloading them into the atmosphere silently 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.349
 and generated us 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.009
 that is, what components of the exhaust system it offers in samos 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.630
 We think you have the most extensive variety in silence from the mine 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.489
 aluminized 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.969
 and in components of the exhaust system offering the following links online 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:31.970
 prize 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.030
 The original silencers and ansa retain the design and the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.050

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.220
 inc January we have received many calls apart the previous program asking 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.090
 for the sports exhaust f1

 who can comment on us 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.400

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.290
 for people who want more 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.670
 more power less gasoline consumption 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.269
 ma better performance 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.539
 all this with a nice sound 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.180
 for now that we thank the engineer césar villarreal

 Carlos received those of the coffee accident Monterrey but removed some of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.030
 what we had to do about the exhaust systems just over 20 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.629
 January 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.190
 if only to tell them that any doubt or type of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.580
 support that they need technical either in the installation of the systems of 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.409
 escape or some kind recommendation of some kind of escape 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.379
 we have our website in technical support @ in samos the dotcom
