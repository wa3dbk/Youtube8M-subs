00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
gonna use this log as one of our corner

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.710 
gonna use this log as one of our corner
logs<00:00:32.960> on<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.560> trellis<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.400> over<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.480> shop

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
logs on the trellis and over in the shop

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.510 
logs on the trellis and over in the shop
I<00:00:35.930> have<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.260> rest<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.710> parts<00:00:37.070> for<00:00:37.370> it

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
I have the rest of the parts for it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.270 
I have the rest of the parts for it
we've<00:00:38.510> got<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> couple<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.170> cross<00:00:39.410> braces<00:00:39.920> here

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
we've got a couple of cross braces here

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.330 
we've got a couple of cross braces here
and<00:00:40.809> then<00:00:41.809> beside<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.710> that's<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.190> other

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
and then beside that that's the other

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.690 
and then beside that that's the other
three<00:00:43.640> posts<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.440> there's<00:00:45.440> two<00:00:45.710> long<00:00:46.670> pieces

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
three posts and there's two long pieces

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.420 
three posts and there's two long pieces
for<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.450> bottom<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:47.920> bottom<00:00:48.920> rail<00:00:49.100> and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
for the bottom of bottom rail and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.030 
for the bottom of bottom rail and
there's<00:00:50.270> another<00:00:50.600> two<00:00:51.019> for<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.350> top<00:00:51.559> rail<00:00:51.769> and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
there's another two for the top rail and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.250 
there's another two for the top rail and
then<00:00:52.580> there's<00:00:52.820> some<00:00:53.089> material<00:00:53.720> for<00:00:53.870> angle

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
then there's some material for angle

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.160 
then there's some material for angle
bracing<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.250> corners<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.839> way<00:00:56.960> we're

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
bracing in the corners so the way we're

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.509 
bracing in the corners so the way we're
going<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.379> approach<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:58.159> to<00:00:58.339> use<00:00:58.489> a

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
going to approach this is to use a

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.410 
going to approach this is to use a
mortise<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.360> tenon<00:00:59.830> approach<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.879> as<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.330> can

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
mortise and tenon approach so as you can

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.200 
mortise and tenon approach so as you can
see<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.750> mortise<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:04.040> goes<00:01:04.309> into<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.000> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
see the mortise it goes into and the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.330 
see the mortise it goes into and the
tenon<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.720> on<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.020> end<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.380> log<00:01:06.590> well

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
tenon is on the end of the log well

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.070 
tenon is on the end of the log well
these<00:01:07.520> are<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.909> main<00:01:08.360> tools<00:01:08.659> that<00:01:08.810> you're

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
these are the main tools that you're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.920 
these are the main tools that you're
gonna<00:01:09.229> need<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.860> need<00:01:10.040> an<00:01:10.190> Olga<00:01:10.490> bet<00:01:10.930> this

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
gonna need you can need an Olga bet this

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.649 
gonna need you can need an Olga bet this
one's<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.260> 2-inch<00:01:12.680> piece<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.300> get<00:01:14.450> them<00:01:14.540> up

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
one's a 2-inch piece you can get them up

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.440 
one's a 2-inch piece you can get them up
to<00:01:14.690> four<00:01:15.350> or<00:01:15.440> five<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:15.950> think<00:01:16.220> even<00:01:16.549> six<00:01:17.030> inches

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
to four or five I think even six inches

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.670 
to four or five I think even six inches
and<00:01:18.440> down<00:01:19.010> as<00:01:19.220> small<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:19.580> you'd<00:01:19.729> like<00:01:20.680> it's

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and down as small as you'd like it's

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.160 
and down as small as you'd like it's
actually<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:23.360> one's<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.690> Milwaukee

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
actually this one's a Milwaukee

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.890 
actually this one's a Milwaukee
self-feeding<00:01:27.170> bit<00:01:27.670> then<00:01:28.670> there's<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.540> tenon

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
self-feeding bit then there's the tenon

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.320 
self-feeding bit then there's the tenon
cutter<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:31.370> as<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:31.850> see<00:01:31.970> has<00:01:32.300> a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
cutter and this as you can see has a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.290 
cutter and this as you can see has a
sharp<00:01:32.990> blade<00:01:33.230> in<00:01:33.440> here<00:01:33.740> and<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.940> put<00:01:35.120> it<00:01:35.210> in

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
sharp blade in here and you put it in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.200 
sharp blade in here and you put it in
your<00:01:35.480> drill<00:01:36.440> this<00:01:36.980> is<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> half-inch<00:01:37.670> Makita

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
your drill this is a half-inch Makita

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.930 
your drill this is a half-inch Makita
drill<00:01:38.240> put<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.190> as<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.520> turns<00:01:40.760> around

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
drill put that in and as it turns around

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.630 
drill put that in and as it turns around
it'll<00:01:41.720> cut<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:41.960> tenon<00:01:42.410> on<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.070> end<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.550> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
it'll cut the tenon on the end of the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.050 
it'll cut the tenon on the end of the
log<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.150> then<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.200> mortise<00:01:45.590> obviously<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
log and then the mortise obviously the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.330 
log and then the mortise obviously the
drill<00:01:47.300> will<00:01:47.480> cut<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.810> mortise<00:01:48.170> outside<00:01:49.160> the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
drill will cut the mortise outside the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.240 
drill will cut the mortise outside the
the<00:01:49.880> or<00:01:50.540> goal<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.960> cut<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.260> mortise<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.040> then

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the or goal to cut the mortise and then

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.790 
the or goal to cut the mortise and then
you<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.940> put<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.690> tenon<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
you can put the tenon like that and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.470 
you can put the tenon like that and
hopefully<00:01:57.800> that<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.400> law<00:01:58.700> works<00:01:59.030> as<00:01:59.300> it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
hopefully that that law works as it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.660 
hopefully that that law works as it
comes<00:01:59.720> together<00:01:59.870> I'm<00:02:00.530> gonna<00:02:00.800> do<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:01.190> on<00:02:01.430> my

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
comes together I'm gonna do this on my

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.380 
comes together I'm gonna do this on my
machine<00:02:02.140> which<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.970> sort<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.000> slightly<00:02:05.270> more

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
machine which is sort of slightly more

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.259 
machine which is sort of slightly more
designed<00:02:05.930> for<00:02:06.050> building<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:07.670> kind<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
designed for building this kind of the

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.059 
designed for building this kind of the
first<00:02:08.509> thing<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.080> trim<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.560> ends<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:10.039> your

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
first thing is to trim the ends of your

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:22.660 
first thing is to trim the ends of your
logs<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.640> they're<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> right<00:02:11.060> length

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.600 

well<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.390> jig<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.750> made<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.200> makes

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
well this is the jig I made it makes

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.940 
well this is the jig I made it makes
tenants<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.730> also<00:02:26.120> mortises<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.650> spin

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
tenants and also mortises and I can spin

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.530 
tenants and also mortises and I can spin
stuff<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.840> lathe<00:02:31.270> at<00:02:32.270> this

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
stuff just like on on the lathe at this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.380 
stuff just like on on the lathe at this
end<00:02:32.750> I've<00:02:32.900> got<00:02:33.140> my<00:02:33.350> cutting<00:02:33.860> blade<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.400> I've

project<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.630> think<00:04:04.690> two<00:04:05.049> inches<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> it's<00:04:06.670> a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
project I think two inches is a it's a

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.240 
project I think two inches is a it's a
good<00:04:07.030> length<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.290> it's<00:04:08.410> about<00:04:08.650> three<00:04:08.920> inches

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
good length and it's about three inches

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.340 
good length and it's about three inches
long<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.299> haven't<00:04:10.480> given<00:04:10.720> measurements

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
long and I haven't given measurements

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.580 
long and I haven't given measurements
for<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.680> whole<00:04:11.890> trellis<00:04:12.820> because<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:14.350> can

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
for the whole trellis because you can

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.000 
for the whole trellis because you can
vary<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.190> whatever<00:04:15.340> size<00:04:15.549> you'd<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:17.010> I'm

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010

going<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.400> use<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.609> 36<00:04:19.329> grit<00:04:19.450> on<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.989> grinder

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
going to use a 36 grit on the grinder

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.490 
going to use a 36 grit on the grinder
and<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.799> take<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.539> nuts<00:04:22.539> down<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.320> this

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
and just take the nuts down so this

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:53.129

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
pieces and all the ends are turned now

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.379 
pieces and all the ends are turned now
so<00:05:08.650> our<00:05:09.039> next<00:05:09.340> job<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.849> drill<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.180> holes

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
so our next job is to drill the holes

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.569 
so our next job is to drill the holes
