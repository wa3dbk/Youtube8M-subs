it be you know the broader the broader
creative<00:00:41.440> team<00:00:42.269> because<00:00:43.269> I<00:00:43.390> think<00:00:43.449> they<00:00:43.839> are

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
creative team because I think they are

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.270 
creative team because I think they are
inspired<00:00:44.769> by<00:00:45.600> many<00:00:46.600> different<00:00:46.870> things<00:00:47.320> and

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
they bring that and I think my

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.950 
they bring that and I think my
inspiration<00:00:51.370> comes<00:00:51.520> from<00:00:51.850> from<00:00:52.360> seeing<00:00:52.719> that
