 aldo osorio ask hello jose this is 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.679
 my aquarium I want you to give me your opinion 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.540
 and I plan to plant it with some 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.760
 how many watermelons which could be 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.740
 thanks in advance I love your videos 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.390
 numbers I miss for nothing in terms of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.769
 nuria refers to the flag and variety 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.659
 walter and is the hardest and the most 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.819
 apparent then you have the carrot is the 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.650
 wta are leaf shaped tip and 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.989
 then the nana beans that are more 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.789
 little ones these two are also very 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.649
 easy and for example I do not recommend 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.359
 the nubia teÃ³fila because it is a plant 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.700
 which tends to break down very easily 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.890
 a nutritious substrate would not be necessary 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.690
 for these plants but if you tie the o 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.730
 bury them a little fertilize everything 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.440
 pills but in very little amount already 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.180
 that grows very slowly that's why it would be 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.740
 advisable to accompany them with some other 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.020
 fast growing plant 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.910
 Ivan Martinez says with the lady aquarius 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.980
 I am ban want to know how many 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.170
 schools of tea back can I have in my 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.180
 aquarium of 40 liters and I can introduce 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.950
 fish scale in my aquarium of 100 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.200
 liters in which I have three times the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.510
 gold would be a pleasure to answer me a 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.180
 greeting from chiapas mexico shoals 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.070
 in 40 liters only one and if at all 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.749
 eight or nine times teapot and already 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.650
 we would be accessing a bit of the 

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:10.870
 aquarium limit 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.280
 the scalars with the floro and 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.090
 other types of cichlids are not 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.800
 recommendable 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.140
 although many have them like this is not very 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.540
 sure not good red quito says hello 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.640
 jose I want to ask you a question 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.710
 a common fish goal that was gray change of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.660
 color in a matter of weeks now it's 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.610
 orange and note missing him two 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.740
 scales on the right side in half 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.810
 of the body what I do not know if it is that it is 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.240
 a scar that was not noticed by the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.100
 color or is some disease I have it in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.390
 an aquarium of almost 90 liters next to a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 kite I hope you can help me 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.890
 thank you very much it is normal that some 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.630
 fish including the blows change from 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.250
 color , especially if you give them light 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.170
 solar something logical from aquariums 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.700
 indoors if you do not want seaweed you do not 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.710
 surprised if it changes color again 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.600
 or it ends up taking a whole white color 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.160
 this is not bad and it is not supposed to 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.869
 should give any kind of problem in 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.520
 principle because of the scales if 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.400
 only one or two that have fallen 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.410
 without any apparent wound it is also not 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.450
 nothing weird because this can go through the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.640
 rubbing with plastic plates with objects 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 of the aquarium or by fights with other fish 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.880
 so you should not act unless 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 see other symptoms 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.570
 Nicholas says hello again I a 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.930
 asks what is the relationship between gravel 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.329
 ground substrate 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.560
 and the fish tank suit without getting 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.269
 when we were going to put gravel and a 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.489
 nutritious substrate the instructions of 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.900
 this will tell us how much to put later for 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.790
 calculate the kilos of gravel that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.159
 we need in our closet we have 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.260
 that multiply the length of the aquarium the 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.780
 length of the aquarium by the width of the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.489
 aquarium by the height centimeters of 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 tax that we want to put that would come to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.930
 be an average of about 10 centimeters 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.670
 back and about five centimeters forward 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.500
 an average of plus or minus 8 that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.359
 we should reduce according to the amount of 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.040
 nutritious substrate that we put and what 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.019
 we divide by 1000 for example a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.299
 aquarium 100 centimeters long by 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.760
 40 in width by 8 centimeters in height 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.590
 of gravel would not give about 32 thousand 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.230
 cubic centimeters I have divided between 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.790
 1000 will be 32 kilos of gravel there are people 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.579
 that needs more tax or less serious 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
 according to the plants the fish and the size 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.849
 of the aquarium is already something to put in the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.430
 calculation the centimeters of gravel that 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.500
 you want ricardo cornejo says hello 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.049
 again I have a question for you I have a fish 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.599
 scalar angel in a 30-liter tank 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.730
 Yesterday I bought charales and saw how the fish 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.900
 angel was bothering him 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.299
 there is something in my aquarium or they are 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.500
 incompatible thanks in your aquarium the 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.170
 problem is the size 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.210
 that is to say for a scalar 30 liters is 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.400
 almost nothing needs a minimum of 60 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.620
 liters this is true but they should 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.450
 live in more than 100 liters to live the 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.160
 maximum time possible with this you 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.600
 I want to say that in so few liters is 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 normal that a scalar bother to 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.020
 any small fish since they are 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.640
 territorial and also feed on 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.680
 if they fit in your mouth 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.420
 ignacio says hello jose the golf is from me 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.880
 sister has one as a triangular medium 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.480
 the one who is naranjito I do not know what is for 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.480
 please help me 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.620
 it seems that he has a detachment 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.390
 of the retina will surely be caused by 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.100
 some plastic plant or object of the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.630
 aquarium that I do not know if you will have and if not 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.610
 I may give a fight with another fish 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.560
 there would be little to do if you do not appreciate 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.720
 an external damage simply keep the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.310
 water with excellent quality and if you see it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.170
 some external damage can be applied 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.910
 a little bit of methylene blue should you 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.920
 know that when your fish have 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.650
 this type of problem surely no longer 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.600
 you will see by that good eye we have finished and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.900
 see you on Sunday in a new video 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.790
 goodbye and while I answered you ask 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.790
 my assistant was doing this 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.700
 thanks for being there and being the best 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.700
 subscribers of the world 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.640
 why 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.699
 all right
