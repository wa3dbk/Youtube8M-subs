00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.380
There's a little bite. Reel down here, and
there we go! Ever feel like you're fishing

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.610
out in the middle of no where? Actually
I am if you look around I'm way away from

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.630
the shore.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.630
What happens in the fall on these northern
lakes throughout the Midwest is panfish move

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.770
off the weed line. Nice little bluegill, we'll
put him back. They move off the weed line and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.730
move out to the basin areas of the lake. The reason for
that is because the surface water temperature is starting

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.000
to drop and actually the warmer water builds
out in the basin and that's where those bluegills,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.530
crappies, and perch go set up on. What they
do is they just kind of hover around a really

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.600
non distinct area. We use our sonar to go
around looking with the boat in these basin

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.780
areas and try to mark the fish. At that point
in time we will drop a couple waypoints on

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.790
them. But the whole key is to hover and move
around where those fish at. They're moving

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.200
about so what I like to do is fish a slip
bobber system like this, set it for a foot

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.479
off the bottom, and then I put a little swivel
and actually use a little ice fishing jig.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.789
I'll tip that ice fishing jig with a little
waxie or maybe a plastic depending on what

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.819
the fish want. On this particular day they're
rather finicky and very lite biters so we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.229
put a waxie on there. Then I simply start working around the perimeter

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.289
of the boat. One of the things I like to fish
is a braided line and there's a reason for

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.170
that. I'm fishing these lighter fish way away
from the boat and the bobber goes down I can

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.450
get a much better hookset into that fish.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.819
Typically I always use mono or a fluorocarbon
leader when I'm fishing this type of situation

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.770
where i have a braid mainline.
There's a couple things mono or fluorocarbon

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.590
will do for you; you get a much for natural
presentation so it makes these micro baits

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.800
more lifelike when they're down there in the
water column. The one thing fluorocarbon typically

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.740
does for you is it's almost invisible. So
if I'm fishing real clear water I want to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.810
fish a fluorocarbon line and that will give
me an added advantage if those fish are kind

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.990
of finicky so the fish can't see that line.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.570
We just went over a bunch of fish and I'm
going to do trackback on this sonar so I can

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.870
go back and find that school of fish. We're
starting to see them on the bottom here and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.520
now there that school of fish is. I'm going
to put a waypoint along with this other one

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.520
right there and we'll save that. So there
we've got the waypoint on it and we'll go

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.730
back and see if we can catch a few of those
fish.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.730
There's a bite! Got him! Feels like a good
gill. We went over that school of fish, marked

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.700
a waypoint on them, and threw the cork with
that little jig on top of those fish and bam

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460
he was there.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.870
Out on these basin areas it's hard for a lot
of people especially if you're used to fishing

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.850
structure, weed cover, timber, or brush piles
to go out and fish this open water. But using

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.310
your sonar and just basically looking for
fish.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.310
Look at that nice gill! Look at that fatty!

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.150
A lot of times its just drifting along with
your boat or using your motor and the whole

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.550
key is to focus in on your sonar so when you're
marking those fish put a waypoint on them.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.330
Even if you go over them like we did with
this fish. We went over this school of fish,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.680
I thought boy I better go back and use that
trackback feature to see where those fish

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.920
are at and put a waypoint on them, and then
we quietly slide back up there with the electric

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.500
trolling motor. Get this hook out of them.
Little tiny hooks like that are extremely

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.069
sharp so when you pin them typically you've
got them pinned pretty good.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:24.069
We'll put this fish back in the water. But
you can see how big those bluegills are and

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.340
you'll be surprised at how many big gills
you'll catch. One of the things you do have

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.120
to be aware of is to practice catch an release
on these fish because they're real trophies.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.930
These are real bulls so we'll put him back
in the water here.
