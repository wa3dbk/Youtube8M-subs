00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
 Why are angels invisible? 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.060
 I hope I can see my angel. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.840
 Like... it will be calm to see who protects you 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.560
 God said, you are never alone, they are there, but you don't see them. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.780
 I just hope 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.140

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.360

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.360
 I am your guardian angel 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 At last 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.480
 This is awesome 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 What is the angel of how to see 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.320
 Yes 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 God has answered your prayers. From now on, you will see your angels. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 Awesome, finally coming! 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.220
 Awesome, I can go around with my guardian angel now, I wonâ€™t feel lonely 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.080
 I finally got my wish. 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.160
 Why are you here? 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 Remember, I am your guardian angel 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.100
 Can you be my guardian angel somewhere else? I take a shower 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 Remember, God answered your prayers. 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.240
 Then hand me the paper towel, please 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.080
 good 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.680
 what are you doing? 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400
 Ok, I protect you, what must I do? 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.740
 However, just don't "read my shoulders, please 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 Again, God answered your prayers. 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.040
 Now, I think I can do my homework without any distractions. 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.840
 good 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.820
 What is the first place? 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 The answer is B. 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.420
 Hey! this is correct 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.060
 Now, number 2 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 This is confusing, too 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.460
 The answer is D. 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960
 D! 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 wait? 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.900
 Hey! Did you do it here? 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.380
 Remember, God answered your prayers, I am your guardian angel. 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.580
 I have to do this myself, how do I know if you said the wrong answer? 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.400
 I always help you Seanna, you can't see me before. 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.060
 Can you stand there? 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.500
 leave me alone! 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.140
 Stop following me. Why are you following me? 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.940
 Why are you following me? I am not in trouble. Can you give me a break? 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.060
 No, no, no. This is what you want. 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.440
 I don't know if I am here! 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.800
 I just want to stay here. 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.480
 I really need to rest from that guy. 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.600
 Who is it from? 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.980
