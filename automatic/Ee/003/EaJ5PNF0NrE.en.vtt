00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
here but it shows you the lack of

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.170 
here but it shows you the lack of
consistency<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.930> color<00:03:04.470> yellow<00:03:07.160> anyway

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
consistency with the color yellow anyway

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.890 
consistency with the color yellow anyway
