through a recession at the moment as

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.520 
through a recession at the moment as
well<00:03:45.430> people<00:03:45.760> more<00:03:45.850> people<00:03:45.989> not<00:03:46.989> able<00:03:47.320> to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
well people more people not able to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.870 
well people more people not able to
afford<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:48.010> which<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.400> unfortunate

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
afford it which is really unfortunate

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.360 
afford it which is really unfortunate
but<00:03:49.750> it's<00:03:49.930> not<00:03:50.140> just<00:03:50.500> horse<00:03:50.769> owners<00:03:51.190> who

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
but it's not just horse owners who

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.250 
but it's not just horse owners who
recognize<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.030> possibilities<00:03:52.660> raised<00:03:52.989> by

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
recognize the possibilities raised by

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.380 
recognize the possibilities raised by
the<00:03:53.320> Great<00:03:53.590> British<00:03:53.950> horse<00:03:54.160> survey<00:03:54.610> it's<00:03:55.209> an

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
the Great British horse survey it's an

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.150 
the Great British horse survey it's an
industry<00:03:55.630> involving<00:03:56.230> many<00:03:56.440> thousands<00:03:57.040> of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
industry involving many thousands of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.460 
industry involving many thousands of
people<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.700> different<00:03:57.940> capacities<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
people in different capacities the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.410 
people in different capacities the
surveys<00:03:59.860> finding<00:04:00.370> should<00:04:00.580> help<00:04:00.790> them<00:04:00.970> all<00:04:01.180> to

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
surveys finding should help them all to

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.930 
surveys finding should help them all to
improve<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.989> lives<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.440> horses<00:04:02.890> in<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.250> UK<00:04:03.670> I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
improve the lives of horses in the UK I

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.820 
improve the lives of horses in the UK I
think<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.019> Great<00:04:05.260> British<00:04:05.620> horse

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
think that the Great British horse

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.800 
think that the Great British horse
survey<00:04:06.220> is<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.549> wonderful<00:04:07.030> idea<00:04:07.150> i<00:04:07.390> think<00:04:07.510> it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
survey is a wonderful idea i think it

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.259 
survey is a wonderful idea i think it
will<00:04:07.900> give<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.049> good<00:04:08.230> insight<00:04:08.650> as<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.370> state

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
will give a good insight as to the state

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.030 
will give a good insight as to the state
of<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.600> welfare<00:04:10.989> whore<00:04:11.170> welfare<00:04:11.680> within<00:04:11.920> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
of the welfare whore welfare within the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.150 
of the welfare whore welfare within the
UK<00:04:12.220> i<00:04:12.610> think<00:04:13.540> whatever<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.959> level<00:04:14.290> within<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
UK i think whatever the level within the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.320 
UK i think whatever the level within the
industry<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.580> you're<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.760> whether<00:04:16.120> its

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
industry that you're in whether its

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.150 
industry that you're in whether its
leisure<00:04:16.570> riding<00:04:17.109> whether<00:04:17.350> it's<00:04:17.560> an<00:04:17.769> elite

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
leisure riding whether it's an elite

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.759 
leisure riding whether it's an elite
such<00:04:18.489> as<00:04:18.700> emma<00:04:18.910> venting<00:04:19.419> here<00:04:19.600> today<00:04:19.989> i<00:04:20.200> think

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
such as emma venting here today i think

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.190 
such as emma venting here today i think
it<00:04:21.070> will<00:04:21.160> whoever<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.240> are<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.600> be<00:04:22.720> great<00:04:23.020> for

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
it will whoever you are it be great for

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.480 
it will whoever you are it be great for
you<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.380> fill<00:04:23.500> in<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.680> survey<00:04:24.100> because

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
you to fill in the survey because

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.070 
you to fill in the survey because
obviously<00:04:24.820> we<00:04:25.180> need<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.450> get<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:25.600> wider<00:04:25.870> picture

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
obviously we need to get a wider picture

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
obviously we need to get a wider picture
and<00:04:26.530> then<00:04:26.710> obvious<00:04:27.039> try<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.400> tackle<00:04:27.700> it

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
and then obvious try and tackle it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.130 
and then obvious try and tackle it
tackle<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.760> problem<00:04:29.090> because<00:04:29.780> people

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
tackle the problem because people

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.200 
tackle the problem because people
individually<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.340> individual<00:04:31.820> horses

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
individually have individual horses

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.760 
individually have individual horses
there's<00:04:32.540> not<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.720> pooling<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.230> knowledge<00:04:33.560> is

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
there's not a pooling of knowledge is

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.500 
there's not a pooling of knowledge is
them<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.550> think<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.820> will<00:04:34.940> be<00:04:35.030> wonderful

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
them and I think this will be wonderful

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.150 
them and I think this will be wonderful
