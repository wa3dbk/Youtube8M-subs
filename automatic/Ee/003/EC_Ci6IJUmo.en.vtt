00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.420
 before doing our practical videos 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.240
 I would like to tell you about the drinks 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.369
 with express some particularities and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.720
 especially the recipe so that it is 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 prepared at the moment that what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.780
 let's be doing first let's talk about 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.580
 espresso doppio or double espresso 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.860
 a lot of the bar's terminology ism 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.750
 obviously it has developed in italy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 because the current concept of cafeteria 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.449
 that we have developed in Italy to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.699
 this thick doppio we need 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.800
 necessarily use the double filter holder 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.559
 with your machine comes in two holders 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
 filters one that has an output and the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.519
 another that has two outputs 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.040
 then we will use the two 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.860
 outputs with the techniques that we have 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.850
 come driving in barista 1 we go to 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.510
 leave the same drop of 26 to 30 seconds 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.540
 taking into account the characteristics 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.780
 we are looking for cream and liquid 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.850
 that you remember a consistent cream and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.010
 a good body fluid 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.220
 we are going to look for 60 milliliters of 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.440
 drink 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 We are not going to add milk in this 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.430
 occasion we're just going to make a 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 express 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 next let's watch the video 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.870
 or not 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.530
 no more
