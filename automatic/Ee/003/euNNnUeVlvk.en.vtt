00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.579
 to the top I'm full this full of work 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.519
 aside they are editing that this bigger 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.390
 that there is more demand learns more things to 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.589
 sue one of those this and so they continue 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.079
 what is happening but in reality 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.229
 everything is fine and we are here as 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.050
 I will always know back with everything 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.760
 to this we must quickly tell you a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.120
 little about a product that I like 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.930
 a lot and this is a poncho is a punch 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.020
 to breastfeed 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.940
 is the creator is called mariella and now 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.910
 I was in contact with her for 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.190
 talk to me about this point to breastfeed 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.250
 that has many different ways of 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.040
 used and what I love about this is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.560
 how you look like this is a fabric 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.290
 and it's been a poncho or a scarf and 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.570
 It can also be used as a cover for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.060
 breastfeed because nothing else you put it on 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.390
 put it in the bottom and you're done 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.000
 you quickly have it as your 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 poncho to breastfeed also as is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.510
 stretchable stretches pretty well and is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.480
 long it can also be like this one 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.580
 a user a way to love your 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.230
 baby you know they like to be 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.690
 wonderful and with hands down 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.180
 also for that you can use it for 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.070
 more pictures of how to use it or how to use it 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.000
 look already put to have want to visit 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 my blog ok 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 where will I also talk about this the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.450
 I really like it, it's very 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.690
 easy and very practical to use I know nothing 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 plus 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.780
 you take it you put it you put it like that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.739
 in this way and ready you have it 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.470
 ready you put the baby in the part of 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.569
 down and loves blankets in public for 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.970
 who should breastfeed this post 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.250
 teaching your breast there are people are very 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.840
 skeptical so this one is fine 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.580
 you can also put it nothing else like this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.739
 Now that I bring it, it is used with the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 bottom part then a blazer 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.120
 then it does not look very nice but as 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.700
 you wear a long-sleeved blouse like this 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.489
 Sencillita looks pretty nice this in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.739
 the top part also another way 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.599
 to use it if you're not breastfeeding and 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.030
 do not want to use it as a poncho 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.420
 I could say nothing else I speak it what 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.530
 grabs 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.530
 for the two ends 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.210
 you put it on 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.030
 you can pass it back if you have 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.030
 a scarf you can put it on 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 this is another way of how to use it 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.360
 as well 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.959
 as looking also in this way 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.090
 as I say you can also use it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.650
 as a user to love your baby was 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.420
 time to sleep if also if you do not like 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.489
 make a kind scarves and other bands 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.980
 for nothing because they also used that way 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.840
 I like the uses of the use of 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.790
 three ways that I already mentioned the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 I really love the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.140
 cloth is well fine ligerita well cool 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.180
 the hot weather would not give you out 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.920
 use it to not kill your baby 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.540
 in cold weather , also what is not 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.280
 well it does not come badly it is very breathable not 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.750
 it's nothing heavy so if your baby is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.099
 down but by pure chance you will be 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.500
 They fall the blanket up without you giving 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.390
 account can breathe through 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.950
 her so there's no problem the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.510
 truth is that I quite like what 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.370
 more I like it is that it can be used 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.530
 different way is what I most 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.970
 love about it and then it really is 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.209
 all I had to talk about her 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.459
 but I love it and I'm giving away a 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.260
 this contest or raffle is at the level 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.750

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.450

 more and as a scarf as a cover for 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.420

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.000
 I think that is all that anyway 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.290
 Any one that I forget I know 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.300

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.650
 remember listen and follow me on twitter 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.500
 remember that all the rules are 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.660
 verified that if you continue because 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.040
 really realize 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.140
 many people have said that the rules 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.390
 they are pretty many do not know 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.520
 what do I demand too much but sometimes I 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.760
 I say not so one with all the love 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.680
 of the world goes to the mail this one pays sometimes 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.419
 International shipping is worth 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.669
 that what are worth things that are not 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.139
 sending but for love so that 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.350
 people receive things not what 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.690
 it does because it feels good one then 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.130

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.900
