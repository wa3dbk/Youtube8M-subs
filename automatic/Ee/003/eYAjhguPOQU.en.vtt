00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
like clarity the problem is if you go to

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
like clarity the problem is if you go to
the<00:00:27.029> basic<00:00:27.359> panel<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.769> like

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the basic panel and you want to get like

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
the basic panel and you want to get like
a<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.189> grungy<00:00:29.699> look<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> crank<00:00:30.359> your

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
a really grungy look you can crank your

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.500 
a really grungy look you can crank your
clarity<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.399> maxes<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:32.969> 100

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
clarity up but it's it maxes out at 100

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.229 
clarity up but it's it maxes out at 100
right<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.770> go<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.579> adjustment

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
right well if you go to your adjustment

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
right well if you go to your adjustment
brush<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.680> clarity<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
brush you can take your clarity and you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
brush you can take your clarity and you
can<00:00:38.520> max<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.000> at<00:00:39.180> 100<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> go

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
can max it out at 100 and you can go

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.660 
can max it out at 100 and you can go
over<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> I'll<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.430> brush<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
over here and I'll make my brush a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.740 
over here and I'll make my brush a
little<00:00:41.820> bit<00:00:41.940> bigger<00:00:42.030> makes<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
little bit bigger makes it a little

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
little bit bigger makes it a little
faster<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.950> I'll<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.219> paint<00:00:44.460> over<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
faster and I'll just paint over the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
faster and I'll just paint over the
whole<00:00:45.000> photo<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> essentially<00:00:46.950> I've

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
whole photo so essentially I've

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.910 
whole photo so essentially I've
increased<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:47.789> 100<00:00:48.210> well<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.379> stopped

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
increased it by 100 well I'm not stopped

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
increased it by 100 well I'm not stopped
there<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.270> click<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> new<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
there now because I can click on new and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
there now because I can click on new and
then<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.129> come<00:00:53.280> over<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.120> can

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
then I can come over here and I can

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.090 
then I can come over here and I can
paint<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> again<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:55.920> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
paint on it again and I can get that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
paint on it again and I can get that
really<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.840> grungy<00:00:58.370> HDR

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
really it's it's a really grungy HDR

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
really it's it's a really grungy HDR
like<00:00:59.870> textured<00:01:00.870> technique<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.039> doing

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
like textured technique but you're doing

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.410 
like textured technique but you're doing
it<00:01:02.340> right<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.640> inside<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> Lightroom<00:01:03.120> out

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it right here inside of Lightroom out

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.579 
it right here inside of Lightroom out
doing<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> plug-in<00:01:04.320> you're<00:01:04.470> not

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
doing it with a plug-in you're not

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
doing it with a plug-in you're not
moving<00:01:04.769> over<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.220> Photoshop<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
moving over to Photoshop to do it you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
moving over to Photoshop to do it you
don't<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.570> HDR<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.650> you're

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
don't need HDR to do it if you're

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
don't need HDR to do it if you're
looking<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.790> super<00:01:09.270> grungy<00:01:09.840> technique

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
looking for that super grungy technique

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
looking for that super grungy technique
works<00:01:10.799> great<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.189> backgrounds<00:01:11.939> gritty<00:01:12.360> photos

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
works great on backgrounds gritty photos

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
works great on backgrounds gritty photos
like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.159> something<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.729> would

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like this it is something that I would

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
like this it is something that I would
use<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.530> I've<00:01:16.680> already<00:01:16.890> done<00:01:17.009> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
use that for but I've already done it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
use that for but I've already done it
twice<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.000> click<00:01:18.299> new<00:01:18.540> again

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
twice well I can just click new again

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.700 
twice well I can just click new again
and<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> third<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.500> keep

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and I can do it a third time I can keep

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
and I can do it a third time I can keep
going<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> keep<00:01:23.460> stacking<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:24.150> these

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
going it can keep stacking these these

extra clarity onto the image now here's
where<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> tip<00:01:28.890> comes<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.250> okay<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.850> I've

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
where the tip comes in okay because I've

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
where the tip comes in okay because I've
taught<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> before<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.530> problem<00:01:31.979> with

taught that one before the problem with

taught that one before the problem with

race with a really large brush and then

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.500 
race with a really large brush and then
I'll<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.079> kind<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.319> pop<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.769> in<00:03:46.919> on<00:03:47.209> one<00:03:48.209> part

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
I'll just kind of pop it in on one part

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.089 
I'll just kind of pop it in on one part
of<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.720> photo<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.169> what<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.680> doing<00:03:49.919> here<00:03:50.010> is

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
of the photo and what I'm doing here is

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.920 
of the photo and what I'm doing here is
just<00:03:50.190> drawing<00:03:50.549> attention<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.389> then<00:03:51.720> maybe

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
just drawing attention and then maybe

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.240 
just drawing attention and then maybe
reduce<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.470> exposure<00:03:52.769> because<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.129> was

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
reduce the exposure because that was

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.460 
reduce the exposure because that was
really<00:03:53.639> dark<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.169> way<00:03:55.319> I'm<00:03:55.410> just

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
really dark so in that way I'm just

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.460 
really dark so in that way I'm just
drawing<00:03:55.859> attention<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.579> spotlight

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
drawing attention it's like a spotlight

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.379 
drawing attention it's like a spotlight
that's<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.919> into<00:03:59.250> one<00:03:59.549> part<00:03:59.849> of<00:03:59.940> your<00:04:00.060> photo

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
that's going into one part of your photo

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.720 
that's going into one part of your photo
all<00:04:00.840> right<00:04:01.019> well<00:04:01.410> again<00:04:01.859> we<00:04:02.010> can't<00:04:02.280> save<00:04:02.699> that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
all right well again we can't save that

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.629 
all right well again we can't save that
as<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.269> preset<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:04.739> we<00:04:04.919> can<00:04:05.129> do<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.459> kind

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
as a preset but what we can do is kind

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.789 
as a preset but what we can do is kind
of<00:04:05.760> close<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.150> not<00:04:06.299> exactly<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> same<00:04:07.319> but

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
of close it's not exactly the same but

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.610 
of close it's not exactly the same but
we<00:04:07.949> could<00:04:08.099> take<00:04:08.250> our<00:04:08.400> graduated<00:04:09.030> filter<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.620> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
we could take our graduated filter and I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.849 
we could take our graduated filter and I
could<00:04:11.099> do<00:04:11.250> negative<00:04:12.290> exposure<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:13.739> I

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
could do negative exposure just like I

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.449 
could do negative exposure just like I
had<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.879> could<00:04:15.060> drop<00:04:15.299> one<00:04:15.599> in<00:04:16.459> out

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
had here and I could drop one in out

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
same thing I've put that spotlight on

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.600 
same thing I've put that spotlight on
the<00:04:34.560> part<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.920> image<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.250> course<00:04:35.400> I'd

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
the part of the image of course I'd

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.950 
the part of the image of course I'd
probably<00:04:35.760> want<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.030> go<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.330> here<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.600> reduce

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
probably want to go in here and reduce

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.630 
probably want to go in here and reduce
some<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.740> exposure<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.220> little<00:04:38.460> bit<00:04:38.610> I

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
some of the exposure a little bit I

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.400 
some of the exposure a little bit I
think<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.880> was<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.060> little<00:04:39.180> harsh<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:40.110> I<00:04:40.170> put

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.560 
think it was a little harsh but I put
that<00:04:40.500> spotlight<00:04:40.940> generally<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.120> same
