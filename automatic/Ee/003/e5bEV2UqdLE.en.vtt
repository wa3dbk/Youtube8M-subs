00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
there's a ship right here

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.780 
there's a ship right here
yeah<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:35.920> actually<00:03:36.010> interesting<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.640> have

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
yeah it's actually interesting you have

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.370 
yeah it's actually interesting you have
to<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.570> look<00:03:37.840> at<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.170> hard

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
to you have to really look at it hard

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.440 
to you have to really look at it hard
because<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.860> red<00:03:39.100> gets<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.640> way<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.120> it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
because the red gets in the way and it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.940 
because the red gets in the way and it
kind<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.720> cancels<00:03:41.200> out<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.470> shape<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.829> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
kind of cancels out the shape of the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.020 
kind of cancels out the shape of the
ship<00:03:42.630> I'll<00:03:43.630> bet<00:03:43.870> that's<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.140> carrier
