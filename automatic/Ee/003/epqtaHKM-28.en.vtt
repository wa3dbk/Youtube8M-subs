when you're rebuilding the barrier

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.089 
when you're rebuilding the barrier
that's<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.359> hold<00:03:03.569> square<00:03:03.989> or<00:03:04.230> X<00:03:04.500> depending<00:03:05.010> on

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
your console and you might accidentally

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890 
your console and you might accidentally
open<00:03:07.349> this<00:03:07.560> debris<00:03:08.340> which<00:03:08.910> will<00:03:09.120> completely

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
open this debris which will completely

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.599 
open this debris which will completely
mess<00:03:10.109> up<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.380> strategy<00:03:10.829> as<00:03:11.069> you'll<00:03:11.489> be

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
mess up the strategy as you'll be

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.190 
mess up the strategy as you'll be
getting<00:03:11.849> zombies<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> back<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
getting zombies from the back and the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.920 
getting zombies from the back and the
front<00:03:13.349> which<00:03:13.890> will<00:03:14.269> eventually<00:03:15.269> they<00:03:15.810> will

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
front which will eventually they will

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.569 
front which will eventually they will
overrun<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.709> because<00:03:16.890> it'll<00:03:17.069> be<00:03:17.159> too<00:03:17.189> much

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
overrun you because it'll be too much

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.680 
overrun you because it'll be too much
work

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
work

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.200 
work
so<00:03:19.080> again<00:03:19.830> make<00:03:20.430> sure<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:23.030> open<00:03:24.030> this

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
so again make sure not to open this

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.530 
so again make sure not to open this
thing

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
thing

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.890 
thing
besides<00:03:25.320> for<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:26.390> that's<00:03:27.390> all<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.570> got<00:03:27.780> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
besides for that that's all you got to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.650 
besides for that that's all you got to
worry<00:03:27.930> about<00:03:28.200> really<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.950> if<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.120> keep<00:03:30.360> going

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
worry about really and if you keep going

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.290 
worry about really and if you keep going
at<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.840> eventually<00:03:31.740> you'll<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.280> into<00:03:32.520> even

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
at it eventually you'll get into even

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.860 
at it eventually you'll get into even
further<00:03:33.930> rounds<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.630> really<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.810> this

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
further rounds and really this this

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.860 
further rounds and really this this
could<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.970> strategy<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.720> to

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
could this strategy can get you up to

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.450 
could this strategy can get you up to
around<00:03:40.050> thirty<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.800> don't<00:03:41.070> know<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.280> you

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
around thirty now I don't know if you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.130 
around thirty now I don't know if you
noticed<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:41.820> we<00:03:42.000> haven't<00:03:42.510> gotten<00:03:42.630> mule-kick

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
noticed but we haven't gotten mule-kick

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.780 
noticed but we haven't gotten mule-kick
yet<00:03:43.320> even<00:03:43.590> though<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.950> was<00:03:44.070> implemented<00:03:44.670> in

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
yet even though it was implemented in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.910 
yet even though it was implemented in
the<00:03:44.910> update<00:03:45.270> with<00:03:45.750> call<00:03:45.930> duty<00:03:46.110> black<00:03:46.320> ops<00:03:46.590> but

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the update with call duty black ops but

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.690 
the update with call duty black ops but
we<00:03:47.430> simply<00:03:47.790> chose<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:49.040> strictly<00:03:50.040> for<00:03:50.400> this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
we simply chose not to strictly for this

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.650 
we simply chose not to strictly for this
video<00:03:51.980> we<00:03:52.980> could<00:03:53.190> have<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.450> really

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
video we could have you know it really

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.720 
video we could have you know it really
does<00:03:54.960> help<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.710> opportunity<00:03:56.340> to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
does help if you have the opportunity to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.880 
does help if you have the opportunity to
get<00:03:56.850> kneel<00:03:57.270> kick<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:58.050> ahead<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.410> get<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.650> don't
