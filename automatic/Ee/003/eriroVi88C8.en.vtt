make<00:00:23.210> one<00:00:23.480> railway<00:00:23.810> safety<00:00:24.140> system<00:00:24.439> see<00:00:25.189> what

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
make one railway safety system see what

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.370 
make one railway safety system see what
we<00:00:25.610> see<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:26.000> Indian<00:00:26.329> rate<00:00:26.540> to<00:00:26.689> make<00:00:26.930> things

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
we see is Indian rate to make things

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.679 
we see is Indian rate to make things
adapt<00:00:27.649> to<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:27.860> Indian<00:00:28.040> Railways<00:00:28.430> we<00:00:29.029> see<00:00:29.450> that

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
adapt to the Indian Railways we see that

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.549 
adapt to the Indian Railways we see that
we<00:00:29.869> need<00:00:30.020> safety<00:00:31.149> reliability<00:00:32.170> speed<00:00:33.170> and

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
we need safety reliability speed and

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.709 
we need safety reliability speed and
efficiency<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:34.910> we've<00:00:35.059> come<00:00:35.300> up<00:00:35.420> with<00:00:35.540> an

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
efficiency so we've come up with an

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.600 
efficiency so we've come up with an
onboard<00:00:35.960> system<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:36.980> works<00:00:37.219> on<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.489> principle

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
onboard system it works on the principle

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.060 
onboard system it works on the principle
of<00:00:38.090> ultrasonic<00:00:38.930> waves<00:00:39.140> now<00:00:39.620> Jake<00:00:39.860> will

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070

we've<00:00:43.730> come<00:00:44.030> up<00:00:44.060> here<00:00:44.480> with<00:00:44.720> an<00:00:44.840> innovative

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
we've come up here with an innovative

Train<00:00:57.860> keeps<00:00:58.220> on<00:00:58.399> emitting<00:00:58.850> signals<00:00:59.030> which

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
Train keeps on emitting signals which

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.150 
Train keeps on emitting signals which
are<00:00:59.570> picked<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.930> picked<00:01:00.200> up<00:01:00.380> by<00:01:00.620> checkpoints

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
are picked it picked up by checkpoints

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.119 
are picked it picked up by checkpoints
like<00:01:01.340> this<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.450> when<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.440> train<00:01:03.649> signals

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
like this so when the train signals

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.429 
like this so when the train signals
reach<00:01:04.399> the<00:01:04.699> checkpoints<00:01:05.269> they<00:01:05.630> are<00:01:05.780> activated

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
reach the checkpoints they are activated

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.550 
reach the checkpoints they are activated
and<00:01:06.560> thus<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.820> gate<00:01:08.090> system<00:01:08.329> company<00:01:08.780> comes

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
and thus this gate system company comes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.480 
and thus this gate system company comes
to<00:01:09.680> complete<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:11.689> we<00:01:12.560> decided<00:01:13.159> on<00:01:13.340> this

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
to complete and we decided on this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850 
to complete and we decided on this
system<00:01:13.940> as<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.360> very<00:01:14.690> advantageous<00:01:15.320> and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
system as it is very advantageous and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.070 
system as it is very advantageous and
one<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.670> its<00:01:16.820> main<00:01:17.000> advantages<00:01:17.570> system<00:01:17.930> is

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
one of its main advantages system is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.710 
one of its main advantages system is
that<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.490> an<00:01:19.610> onboard<00:01:20.090> based<00:01:20.360> system

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
that it is an onboard based system

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.600 
that it is an onboard based system
compared<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.440> others<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:22.010> are<00:01:22.100> off<00:01:22.310> board

the<00:01:49.159> Train<00:01:49.540> now<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:50.600> would<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:51.049> to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
the Train now we would like to

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.050 
the Train now we would like to
demonstrate<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.220> working<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> system<00:01:55.060> as

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
demonstrate the working of the system as

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.789 
demonstrate the working of the system as
the<00:01:56.630> train<00:01:56.810> approaches<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> receiver<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
the train approaches a receiver the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.649 
the train approaches a receiver the
transmitting<00:01:58.220> signals<00:01:58.520> work<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.939> then<00:01:59.119> as

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
transmitting signals work and then as

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.990 
transmitting signals work and then as
the<00:02:00.470> train<00:02:00.710> approaches<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> receiver<00:02:01.820> which<00:02:01.970> is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
the train approaches a receiver which is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.460 
the train approaches a receiver which is
placed<00:02:02.330> at<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.540> gate<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.750> will<00:02:03.049> see<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
placed at the gate you will see that the
