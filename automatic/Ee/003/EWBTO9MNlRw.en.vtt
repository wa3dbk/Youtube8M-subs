00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
that eat it in creative mode which is a

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.600 
that eat it in creative mode which is a
lot<00:02:22.480> easier<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.650> pop<00:02:24.070> stuff<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
lot easier you just pop stuff down the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.400 
lot easier you just pop stuff down the
viewing<00:02:27.910> distance<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.390> bigger<00:02:28.930> i<00:02:29.080> think

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
viewing distance is bigger i think

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.180 
viewing distance is bigger i think
there's<00:02:30.400> more<00:02:30.550> materials<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.390> um<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:33.070> don't

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
there's more materials and um you don't

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.060 
there's more materials and um you don't
die<00:02:33.400> when<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.700> fall<00:02:33.850> down<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:36.010> about

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
die when you fall down what I was about

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.430 
die when you fall down what I was about
to<00:02:36.220> mention<00:02:36.459> when<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.820> felt<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:40.300> also<00:02:41.170> what<00:02:41.320> he

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
did ed used to compute it just to put

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
sure building build the NDF widget now

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.199 
sure building build the NDF widget now
it<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.620> technically<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.829> scale<00:03:42.070> like<00:03:42.340> one

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
it is technically to scale like one

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.699 
it is technically to scale like one
block<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> one<00:03:43.750> meter<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:46.110> it's<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.290> lot<00:03:47.590> bigger

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
block to one meter and it's a lot bigger

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.100 
block to one meter and it's a lot bigger
than<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.010> expected<00:03:48.070> me<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.030> honest<00:03:49.299> because

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
than I expected me to be honest because

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.350 
than I expected me to be honest because
I<00:03:50.290> was<00:03:50.410> still<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> voyage<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.360> it's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
I was still a voyage it was like it's

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.539 
I was still a voyage it was like it's
smaller<00:03:52.660> than<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:52.959> think<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:53.980> about<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.400> same

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
smaller than I think it's about the same

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.160 
smaller than I think it's about the same
size<00:03:54.610> as<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.720> original<00:03:55.930> series<00:03:56.440> enterprise<00:03:56.920> I

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
size as the original series enterprise I

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.810 
size as the original series enterprise I
mean<00:03:59.170> that's<00:03:59.260> pretty<00:03:59.440> big<00:03:59.620> but<00:03:59.860> um<00:04:00.070> yeah<00:04:00.579> once

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
mean that's pretty big but um yeah once

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.360 
mean that's pretty big but um yeah once
you<00:04:00.910> put<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.299> Minecraft<00:04:01.810> once<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.590> put<00:04:03.340> it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you put it in Minecraft once you put it

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.070 
you put it in Minecraft once you put it
in<00:04:03.519> an<00:04:03.610> actual<00:04:03.880> kind<00:04:04.419> of<00:04:05.070> tangible

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
in an actual kind of tangible

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.990 
in an actual kind of tangible
format<00:04:08.080> you<00:04:08.739> can<00:04:08.830> really<00:04:09.040> see<00:04:09.280> how<00:04:09.430> big<00:04:09.700> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
format you can really see how big the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.780 
format you can really see how big the
ships<00:04:10.239> are<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.980> mean<00:04:11.980> once<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.220> start<00:04:12.430> filling<00:04:12.700> it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
ships are I mean once I start filling it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.670 
ships are I mean once I start filling it
up<00:04:12.849> I'll<00:04:13.060> find<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.110> don't<00:04:14.290> have<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.440> much

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
up I'll find that I don't have that much

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.229 
up I'll find that I don't have that much
room<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.920> put<00:04:15.220> all<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.459> rooms<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:16.060> in

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
room to put all the rooms and in

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.199 
room to put all the rooms and in
but<00:04:17.190> at<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.340> moment<00:04:18.459> it's<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.970> lot<00:04:19.150> bigger

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
but at the moment it's just a lot bigger

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.150 
but at the moment it's just a lot bigger
than<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.600> expected<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.230> it's<00:04:20.709> taken<00:04:20.980> me<00:04:21.040> ages

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
than I expected and it's taken me ages

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.190 
than I expected and it's taken me ages
to<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.609> wanna<00:04:22.150> ages<00:04:22.570> it's<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.990> few<00:04:23.169> hours

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
to do wanna ages it's like a few hours

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.320 
to do wanna ages it's like a few hours
to<00:04:23.620> do<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.400> outline<00:04:24.550> I'm<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.210> finish

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
to do the outline I'm going to finish

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.220 
to do the outline I'm going to finish
yet<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.030> lot<00:04:28.150> easier<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.660> see<00:04:28.900> when<00:04:29.139> you

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
yet it's a lot easier to see when you

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.890 
yet it's a lot easier to see when you
look<00:04:29.350> at<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:30.570> cheddar<00:04:33.210> 11<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.300> them<00:04:34.419> cells<00:04:34.750> at

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
look at the cheddar 11 of them cells at

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.570 
look at the cheddar 11 of them cells at
the<00:04:34.960> moment<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.870> all<00:04:38.460> going<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.520> be

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the moment it's not like all going to be

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.920 
the moment it's not like all going to be
at<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.790> level<00:04:40.000> like<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.360> new<00:04:40.540> cells<00:04:40.810> gonna

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
at this level like the new cells gonna

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.450 
at this level like the new cells gonna
be<00:04:41.080> further<00:04:41.860> down<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> thing<00:04:43.950> I'm<00:04:44.950> just<00:04:45.280> doing

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
be further down the thing I'm just doing

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.840 
be further down the thing I'm just doing
this<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.760> basically<00:04:46.889> an<00:04:47.889> outline<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.580> test

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
this is basically an outline and a test

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.719 
this is basically an outline and a test
pretty<00:04:49.240> much<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.389> to<00:04:49.690> see<00:04:49.919> if<00:04:50.919> this<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.400> a

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
pretty much just to see if this is a

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.030 
pretty much just to see if this is a
good<00:04:52.030> way<00:04:52.389> to<00:04:52.419> build<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.750> ship<00:04:52.900> obviously<00:04:53.590> it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
good way to build a ship obviously it

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.210 
good way to build a ship obviously it
would<00:04:54.220> be<00:04:54.370> easier<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.700> put<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:56.190> into<00:04:57.190> a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
would be easier to put it in the into a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.090 
would be easier to put it in the into a
map<00:04:57.460> editor<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.060> let<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.300> spit<00:04:58.540> it<00:04:58.660> out

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
map editor and just let it spit it out

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.610 
map editor and just let it spit it out
but<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.310> decided<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.790> do<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.090> way<00:05:02.400> and

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
but I decided to do it this way and

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.950 
but I decided to do it this way and
that's<00:05:05.620> pretty<00:05:05.740> much<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.360> it's<00:05:07.360> all<00:05:07.540> done<00:05:07.780> so

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
that's pretty much it it's all done so

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.330 
that's pretty much it it's all done so
far<00:05:08.110> Scotty<00:05:08.410> kept<00:05:08.560> pestering<00:05:08.770> me<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.130> put<00:05:09.310> a

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
far Scotty kept pestering me to put a

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.070 
far Scotty kept pestering me to put a
video<00:05:09.550> up<00:05:09.639> of<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.060> so<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:10.930> am<00:05:11.320> doing<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:13.810> is

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
video up of it so I am doing that it is

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.240 
video up of it so I am doing that it is
344<00:05:15.070> blocks<00:05:15.340> long<00:05:15.810> 66<00:05:16.810> or<00:05:17.470> it<00:05:17.650> will<00:05:17.770> be<00:05:17.919> sixty

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
344 blocks long 66 or it will be sixty

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.080 
344 blocks long 66 or it will be sixty
six<00:05:18.460> blocks<00:05:18.729> are<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:18.970> think<00:05:19.229> or<00:05:20.229> 64<00:05:20.770> ok<00:05:22.020> i<00:05:24.090> will

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
six blocks are I think or 64 ok i will

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.940 
six blocks are I think or 64 ok i will
try<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.479> fill<00:05:25.660> it<00:05:25.750> up<00:05:25.870> as<00:05:26.080> much<00:05:26.140> as<00:05:26.320> possible<00:05:26.470> I

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
try to fill it up as much as possible I

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.940 
try to fill it up as much as possible I
mean<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:28.750> Kim<00:05:28.960> Ki<00:05:29.140> a<00:05:29.169> hassle<00:05:29.500> especially

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
mean it's Kim Ki a hassle especially

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.490 
mean it's Kim Ki a hassle especially
