00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to experiment i would just pack up

to experiment i would just pack up
everything<00:02:35.420> because<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.019> reason<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.590> that

that's<00:03:44.489> finally<00:03:44.970> there<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:46.319> even<00:03:46.680> though<00:03:46.709> I

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
that's finally there so even though I
