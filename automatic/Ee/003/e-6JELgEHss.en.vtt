this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> dwa<00:00:31.099> 552<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> now<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.410> you're

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this is the dwa 552 so now when you're

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.709 
this is the dwa 552 so now when you're
installing<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.280> desktop<00:00:35.760> adapter<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.570> are

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
installing a desktop adapter we are

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.290 
installing a desktop adapter we are
going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:38.219> inside<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
going to have to get inside of the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.319 
going to have to get inside of the
computer<00:00:39.690> tower<00:00:40.230> itself<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> might<00:00:42.149> need

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
computer tower itself so you might need

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.770 
computer tower itself so you might need
a<00:00:42.390> screwdriver<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> cases<00:00:44.010> these<00:00:44.399> days

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
a screwdriver a lot of cases these days

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.450 
a screwdriver a lot of cases these days
have<00:00:45.780> ways<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.340> know

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
have ways that they can just be you know

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
have ways that they can just be you know
like<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> lever<00:00:48.239> pulled<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> opened<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like a lever pulled and opened up but

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
like a lever pulled and opened up but
you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.670> some<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> older<00:00:51.420> cases<00:00:51.600> you're

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you know some of the older cases you're

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
you know some of the older cases you're
probably<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> need<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> take<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
probably going to need to take out a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.090 
probably going to need to take out a
couple<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.090> screws<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.890> case

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
couple of screws for both the the case

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.880 
couple of screws for both the the case
housing<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.350> slot<00:00:58.559> cover

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
housing and for the little slot cover

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
housing and for the little slot cover
that<00:00:59.160> covers<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.210> PCI<00:01:00.600> slot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that covers up the the PCI slot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.359 
that covers up the the PCI slot
internally<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.160> well<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.320> grab<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> Phillips

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
internally as well so go grab a Phillips

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
internally as well so go grab a Phillips
screwdriver<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.090> most<00:01:06.600> likely<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.110> you're

going to need and then let's take a look
and<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.869> what's<00:01:10.200> inside<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.710> package<00:01:11.330> inside

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and see what's inside the package inside

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
and see what's inside the package inside
the<00:01:12.540> package<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.320> find<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the package you're going to find the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.200 
the package you're going to find the
adapter<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> case<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> dwa<00:01:16.439> 552

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
adapter and in the case of the dwa 552

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
adapter and in the case of the dwa 552
there's<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.750> three<00:01:19.200> antennas<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
there's going to be three antennas that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.210 
there's going to be three antennas that
we<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> screw<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.860> there's<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
we have to screw on and then there's the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.179 
we have to screw on and then there's the
documentation<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.049> important<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
documentation now it's important on the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.039 
documentation now it's important on the
front<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> documentation<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> see

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
front of the documentation you can see

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
front of the documentation you can see
that<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.320> says<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.860> need<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.040> stop<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that it says that we need to stop and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.210 
that it says that we need to stop and
install<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.750> hardware<00:01:31.229> before<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.100> install

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
install the hardware before we install

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
install the hardware before we install
the<00:01:32.490> software<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.689> let's<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.079> ahead<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> do

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the software so let's go ahead and do

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.340 
the software so let's go ahead and do
that<00:01:35.450> now<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.600> we're<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> do

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that now what we're going to want to do

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.840 
that now what we're going to want to do
is<00:01:37.759> use<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> screwdriver<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.979> most<00:01:40.979> PC<00:01:41.400> cases

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
is use a screwdriver and most PC cases

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
is use a screwdriver and most PC cases
have<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> couple<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> screws<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.320> along

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
have a couple of screws that are along

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.200 
have a couple of screws that are along
the<00:01:44.130> edge<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:44.820> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the edge here you're going to want to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.139 
the edge here you're going to want to
take<00:01:45.390> those<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.899> or<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:47.369> might<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> lever

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
take those out or you might have a lever

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.719 
take those out or you might have a lever
like<00:01:48.479> mine<00:01:48.780> does<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.100> easily<00:01:50.310> pop

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
like mine does that you can easily pop

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.800 
like mine does that you can easily pop
it<00:01:50.970> open<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> slot

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it open then where you see the slot

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.899 
it open then where you see the slot
covers<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> identify<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
covers what we want to do is identify a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.679 
covers what we want to do is identify a
pci<00:01:57.689> slot<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:59.520> use<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.420> screwdriver

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
pci slot and then use your screwdriver

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.319
