this makes it to where you win with a
single<00:01:23.520> hit<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.840> over<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
single hit and just do this over and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
single hit and just do this over and
over<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:25.619> until<00:01:26.280> you've<00:01:26.430> won<00:01:26.610> 15<00:01:27.000> times<00:01:27.270> now

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
does it take a little bit of time yeah

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
does it take a little bit of time yeah
is<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.030> tedious<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.509> redundant<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is it a bit tedious and redundant of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.980 
is it a bit tedious and redundant of
course<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> difficult<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.360> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
course but is it difficult not at all

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.450 
course but is it difficult not at all
alright<00:01:34.619> now<00:01:34.710> let's<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:34.920> ahead<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.280> into

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
alright now let's go ahead and get into

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.859 
alright now let's go ahead and get into
the<00:01:35.520> ones<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.240> speculated<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the ones that are a bit speculated and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.910 
the ones that are a bit speculated and
people<00:01:37.079> still<00:01:37.229> aren't<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.590> sure<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
people still aren't really sure how to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069

revenant<00:01:40.530> scan<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.970> unlocked<00:01:42.450> by

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
revenant scan this one I unlocked by

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
revenant scan this one I unlocked by
just<00:01:42.899> playing<00:01:43.170> online<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.770> ranked<00:01:44.070> matches

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just playing online in ranked matches

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
just playing online in ranked matches
now<00:01:45.149> some<00:01:45.390> people<00:01:45.479> believe<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
now some people believe it actually is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200 
now some people believe it actually is
just<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> random<00:01:46.680> drop<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> may<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.399> however

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
just a random drop and it may be however

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
just a random drop and it may be however
in<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:48.869> experience<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> after<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> 10<00:01:50.250> win

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in my experience I got it after a 10 win

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.550 
in my experience I got it after a 10 win
streak<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.930> may<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
streak so I think you may have to get a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
streak so I think you may have to get a
10<00:01:52.829> win<00:01:53.070> streak<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.060> play<00:01:54.270> 30<00:01:54.600> matches

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
10 win streak and then play 30 matches

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
10 win streak and then play 30 matches

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
something like that I don't think so

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.050 
something like that I don't think so
I'm<00:02:55.980> pretty<00:02:56.250> sure<00:02:56.370> if<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.519> just<00:02:56.669> keep<00:02:56.819> playing

many people have told me they got it

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.000 
many people have told me they got it
after<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:00.930> eight<00:03:01.139> tower<00:03:01.469> challenges

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
after just about eight tower challenges

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
after just about eight tower challenges
or<00:03:02.099> maybe<00:03:02.219> even<00:03:02.310> five<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.419> it<00:03:03.540> could<00:03:03.689> just<00:03:03.840> be<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
or maybe even five so it could just be a

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.050 
or maybe even five so it could just be a
random<00:03:04.200> drop<00:03:04.620> unless<00:03:05.370> they're<00:03:05.549> lying<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.000> I
