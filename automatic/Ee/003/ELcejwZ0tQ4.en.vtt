00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 I will tell about the novelty of the Chinese company 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.700
 meizu still in the ranks of the phone is called mx-5 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.830
 enough 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 in the ranks of geeks expected except 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.010
 He called meizu seems to me alone 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.050
 once again the advantages of the laptop in the ranks 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.939
 such people who are interested in smartphones 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 technology and other technologies 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 very expected smartphone very quickly 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 run through the most important numbers which 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 I personally have nothing to say 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.030
 here is a knowledgeable yes here is an eight-core 64 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.090

 quickly and well take a word well 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.640
 personally what is important to me is the camera it is 20.7 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 This is ehegey and internal 5 that is, this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.300
 coolest iphone and more than that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.219
 average between the sixth iphone 6 plus 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.789
 give and let's compare I am 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.800
 borrow 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.159
 open you then the phone will perfectly understand and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.130
 what message is this here i need 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.030
 Differences a bit but give all the air 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.500
 almost all the same any more as 6 plus 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.710
 see we will now take a photo 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.729
 I just want to just show 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 What is the quality of the reverse camera here? 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.110
 usual but this is the opposite 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.640
 was the usual spot is now burdening 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.329
 by the way he 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.790
 looking for video see how we write video 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.040
 by the way nothing on the quality of the camera so here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 even wanted to give it all to play 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030
 I wanted to shoot the letter prompter well suffer 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.790
 the metal doesn't work but 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.710
 fairly lightweight battery 3 and 100 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.689
 milliampere therefore enough as promised 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.250
 manufacturers for almost two days 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 use well here all promise 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.130
 long actually pocket date can 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.800
 be it so it is yes yes yes so what of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.600
 this button before it was sensory and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 with click and now it is possible here 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.370
 you can use it and it works 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.490
 On sensor unlock phone he 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 of course it works on android 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.050
 specific shell well and interesting 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 such a function it works on gestures with 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.740
 screen that is, let's say that I did 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 installed the VKontakte application in order 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.280
 to activate enough to do on 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.050
 on the screen a little letter v this is so cool but 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.250
 and in general, such functions that it can 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.190
 respond like this is a breakthrough on movement 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 there is also some kind of gesture system about 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.900

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.990

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.030

 doubled sales and even entered the top three 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.880
 leaders of our country than all 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.430
 surprised well and lenovo later we start with 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.140
 first place in the ranking of gold 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.330
 goes to the South Korean company 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.220

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.989
 are presented 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.849
 well what we go further second place 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.489
 This year's sales are leaving the gadget from 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.350
 nokia rather microsoft so still past 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.760
 in the fall, the company bought from the Finns and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.520
 production units and 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.139
 mobile phone service so here 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.180
 microsoft are in the top three with 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.979
 With such data, 10 percent sold in 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.660
 this year's smartphones let's also 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.389
 consider what models could bring 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.570
 These results are about lumia 540 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.910

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.530

 Well, now go to the third place in 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.650
 ranking silver medal go 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.419
 chinese company lenovo 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.550
 Well, it would seem surprising that they entered 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.400
 in the top three and what's the matter different 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.710
 from january to june lenovo 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.820
 sold smartphones to shocking 6 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.380
 billion rubles 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.229
 even got around samsung in the price range 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.419
 from 5 to 10 thousand rubles for sales in 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.070
 in kind lenovo also 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.100
 add that for the year increased sales 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.199
 their smartphones one and a half to two times this 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.850
 got due to the containment of price scenes then 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.830
 there is when other brands after the jump 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.930
 currencies and raised prices for their gadgets 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.880
 in lenovo gritting his teeth held and 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.950
 sold smartphones at old prices 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.720
 I was glad that year for lenovo 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.110
 released 10 new models and here 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.169
 some are lenovo p780 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.300
 a6000 and p90 smartphone that already comes with 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.280
 preloaded game world of tanks 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.780
 but also with a rating of winners we 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.210
 sorted on another interesting 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.010
 point looking at the fact that some sales 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.630
 companies soared to the skies 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.060
 situation in the mobile phone market 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.310
 still sad and sale in kind 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.900
 terms decreased by 11 percent if 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.789
 before the Russians for the same time 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.539
 the segment acquired more than 10 million 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.550
 smartphones 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.770
 then this time cost only 9 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.720
 millions of gadgets see realizing 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.180
 situation in the market of technology company 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.070
 relieve turnover apple shipments fell 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.180
 at forty five and seven percent at samsung 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.400
 14 and 4 it remains to hope that Russia does not 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.060
 come back from holidays and mass will rush 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.229
 save the market 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.229
 buy new smartphones
