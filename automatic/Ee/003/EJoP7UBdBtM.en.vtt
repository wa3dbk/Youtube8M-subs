00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
this work I mean I guess I just go heavy

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.800 
this work I mean I guess I just go heavy
heavy<00:05:11.330> heavy

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
heavy heavy

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.379 
heavy heavy
while<00:05:12.289> it's<00:05:12.620> boosted<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.580> mean<00:05:13.759> I<00:05:13.969> that's<00:05:14.270> the

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
while it's boosted I mean I that's the

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.679 
while it's boosted I mean I that's the
only<00:05:14.539> thing<00:05:14.689> I<00:05:14.779> could<00:05:14.839> figure<00:05:15.139> out<00:05:19.479> all<00:05:20.479> right

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
only thing I could figure out all right
