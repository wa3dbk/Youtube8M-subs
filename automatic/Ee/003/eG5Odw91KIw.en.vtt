00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.019 

so<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.750> experience<00:00:18.890> few<00:00:19.890> heavy<00:00:20.610> objects

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
so in your experience few heavy objects

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.900 
so in your experience few heavy objects
fall<00:00:21.240> faster<00:00:21.270> than<00:00:21.720> light<00:00:21.869> ones<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.279> when<00:00:23.610> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
fall faster than light ones and when you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.339 
fall faster than light ones and when you
see<00:00:24.270> them<00:00:26.660> would<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:29.960> they're<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.080> attached

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
see them would what they're not attached

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.490 
see them would what they're not attached
to<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.560> string<00:00:32.750> okay<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.080> you<00:00:34.110> give<00:00:34.290> me<00:00:34.379> an

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
to a string okay can you give me an

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:44.030 
to a string okay can you give me an
example<00:00:34.879> when<00:00:35.879> you<00:00:36.270> saw<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:42.860> pumpkin<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
example when you saw like a pumpkin on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.350 
example when you saw like a pumpkin on
the<00:00:44.100> plane<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.790> first<00:00:45.449> you<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.840> first

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
the plane and first you go first

00:00:47.360 --> 00:01:16.490 
the plane and first you go first
any<00:00:48.360> other<00:00:48.570> examples<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:50.269> see<00:01:15.500> awesome

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
any other examples you see awesome

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
any other examples you see awesome
dilatant<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.010> more<00:01:17.220> from<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
creative to gravity affects you how many

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.650 
creative to gravity affects you how many
you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.140> tested<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:25.250> well<00:01:26.480> how<00:01:27.480> many<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
you have tested this well how many of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.399 
you have tested this well how many of
you<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.900> sure<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.090> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.740 

wait<00:01:35.409> this<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.429> everyone<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:39.570> 200<00:01:40.570> grams

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
wait this is everyone this is 200 grams

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.169 
wait this is everyone this is 200 grams
that<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.079> one<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.429> penguins<00:01:42.429> so<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.030> was

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
that this one is penguins so this was

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.830 
that this one is penguins so this was
going<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.359> fall<00:01:43.539> faster<00:01:43.899> right<00:01:44.369> okay<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.240> we

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
going to fall faster right okay so we

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.590 
going to fall faster right okay so we
know<00:01:47.079> that<00:01:47.319> this<00:01:47.409> will<00:01:47.590> fall<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:49.409> okay<00:01:50.409> so<00:01:51.600> what

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
know that this will fall so okay so what

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.609 
know that this will fall so okay so what
do<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.719> think<00:01:52.899> will<00:01:52.990> happen<00:01:53.140> when<00:01:53.289> I<00:01:53.439> drop

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
do you think will happen when I drop

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.130 
do you think will happen when I drop
cheese<00:01:57.179> okay<00:01:58.179> so<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.979> we<00:02:00.069> go<00:02:01.140> there

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
cheese okay so this one here we go there

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:27.449 
cheese okay so this one here we go there
we<00:02:02.259> go<00:02:25.620> no<00:02:26.620> understand

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
we go no understand

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:43.839 
we go no understand
just<00:02:27.670> watch<00:02:30.420> okay<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.370> Falls

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.199 

so<00:02:44.420> how<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.040> good<00:02:46.340> experiment

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.869 

why<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.719> better<00:02:53.439> okay

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
why is it better okay

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.809 
why is it better okay
because<00:02:55.879> you<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.299> have<00:02:57.609> you<00:02:58.609> can't

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
because you don't have you can't

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.110 
because you don't have you can't
probably<00:03:02.560> very<00:03:03.560> oh<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:04.609> you're<00:03:04.760> saying<00:03:04.909> them

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
probably very oh so you're saying them

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.429 
probably very oh so you're saying them
but<00:03:05.359> that<00:03:05.540> letting<00:03:05.780> go<00:03:05.810> at<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.079> same<00:03:06.200> time

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
but that letting go at the same time

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.330 
but that letting go at the same time
yeah

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
yeah

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.530 
yeah
why<00:03:07.459> would<00:03:07.639> I<00:03:07.670> need<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.909> love<00:03:08.030> about<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.389> same

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
why would I need to love about the same

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.839 
why would I need to love about the same
time<00:03:08.689> every<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.079> watch<00:03:09.260> them<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.590> tell<00:03:12.849> okay

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
time every just watch them to tell okay

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.550 
time every just watch them to tell okay
so<00:03:13.999> I'm<00:03:14.120> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.269> love<00:03:14.450> about<00:03:14.689> the<00:03:14.810> same<00:03:15.079> time

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
so I'm going to love about the same time

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:26.319 
so I'm going to love about the same time
well<00:03:15.980> here<00:03:16.129> we<00:03:16.189> go<00:03:16.280> one<00:03:16.790> two<00:03:17.689> three<00:03:25.239> what<00:03:26.239> is

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
well here we go one two three what is

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.899 
well here we go one two three what is
that<00:03:29.500> okay<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.560> what<00:03:31.189> do<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.400> need<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.699> do<00:03:31.849> is

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
that okay so what do I need to do is

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:40.479 
that okay so what do I need to do is
make<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.389> valid<00:03:32.840> experiment<00:03:39.159> well<00:03:40.159> first

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
make this a valid experiment well first

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.920 
make this a valid experiment well first
need<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.699> make<00:03:40.819> sure<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.449> same<00:03:41.719> height

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
need to make sure that the same height

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.899 
need to make sure that the same height
at<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.319> same<00:03:42.469> height<00:03:42.859> level<00:03:43.299> safely<00:03:45.909> same

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
at the same height level safely same

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.899 
at the same height level safely same
height<00:03:47.090> same<00:03:47.299> time<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:49.099> then<00:03:49.370> what<00:03:49.790> are<00:03:49.849> we

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
height same time and then what are we

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.520 
height same time and then what are we
looking<00:03:50.209> for<00:03:53.019> what<00:03:54.019> are<00:03:54.049> we<00:03:54.169> what<00:03:54.409> are<00:03:54.439> we

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
looking for what are we what are we

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.069 
looking for what are we what are we
going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> look<00:03:54.859> at<00:03:58.930> first

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
going to look at first

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.050 
going to look at first
so<00:04:00.979> which<00:04:01.129> one<00:04:01.310> hits<00:04:01.780> these<00:04:02.780> paths<00:04:03.109> first<00:04:04.060> like

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so which one hits these paths first like

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.759 
so which one hits these paths first like
this<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.449> wait<00:04:05.870> why<00:04:05.989> do<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:06.199> have<00:04:06.439> to<00:04:06.530> do<00:04:06.650> this

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
this so wait why do you have to do this

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.780 
this so wait why do you have to do this
go<00:04:06.979> we<00:04:07.159> can't<00:04:08.060> we<00:04:08.120> just<00:04:08.209> talk<00:04:08.389> about<00:04:08.449> it<00:04:08.659> huh

well<00:04:13.790> we<00:04:13.879> are<00:04:14.000> only<00:04:14.209> in<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.569> piece<00:04:14.750> we<00:04:14.900> decide

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
well we are only in the piece we decide

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.810 
well we are only in the piece we decide
that<00:04:15.409> facts<00:04:15.680> with<00:04:15.859> heavier<00:04:16.519> objects<00:04:16.789> fall

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
that facts with heavier objects fall

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.300 
that facts with heavier objects fall
faster<00:04:19.269> make<00:04:20.269> sure<00:04:20.449> we're<00:04:20.599> ready<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:22.070> I

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
faster make sure we're ready but I

faster make sure we're ready but I
thought<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.970> said<00:04:23.060> very<00:04:23.449> tense<00:04:23.750> before<00:04:24.110> this

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
thought you said very tense before this

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.999 
thought you said very tense before this
that<00:04:25.539> make<00:04:25.719> sure<00:04:25.870> they're<00:04:26.050> right<00:04:26.560> remember

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
that make sure they're right remember

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.149 
that make sure they're right remember
sure<00:04:27.159> they're<00:04:27.400> yeah<00:04:27.699> exactly

this<00:04:30.159> is<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.669> kind<00:04:30.879> of<00:04:30.909> frustrating<00:04:31.180> I

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
this is this is kind of frustrating I

think<00:04:31.629> we<00:04:32.409> do<00:04:32.560> bad<00:04:32.919> experiments<00:04:33.580> or<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:34.270> we

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
think we do bad experiments or if we

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.119 
think we do bad experiments or if we
just<00:04:35.020> talk<00:04:35.229> about<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:36.370> about<00:04:36.879> 2,000<00:04:37.870> years

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
just talk about for about 2,000 years

you're<00:04:44.289> going<00:04:44.349> to<00:04:44.499> tested<00:04:44.889> this<00:04:44.949> before<00:04:45.310> not

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
you're going to tested this before not

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.149 
you're going to tested this before not
in<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.330> class<00:04:46.599> on<00:04:47.379> your<00:04:47.439> own<00:04:47.740> outside<00:04:47.949> of

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
in the class on your own outside of

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.209 
in the class on your own outside of
school<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:48.969> we<00:04:49.740> wondered<00:04:50.740> what<00:04:50.919> you'd<00:04:51.069> find

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
school so we wondered what you'd find

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.239 
school so we wondered what you'd find
out<00:04:53.039> well<00:04:54.039> it<00:04:54.460> was<00:04:54.669> outsiders<00:04:55.979> well<00:04:56.979> how<00:04:57.189> do

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
out well it was outsiders well how do

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.469 
out well it was outsiders well how do
these<00:04:57.430> psychics<00:04:59.340> have<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.460> go<00:05:00.580> out<00:05:00.849> that<00:05:01.180> first

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
these psychics have to go out that first

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.350 
these psychics have to go out that first
class<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.860> 2,000<00:05:03.729> years<00:05:03.879> ago

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
class so 2,000 years ago

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.899 
class so 2,000 years ago
that's<00:05:04.719> the<00:05:04.960> way<00:05:05.080> they<00:05:05.199> operated<00:05:05.620> they<00:05:05.909> would

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
that's the way they operated they would

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:07.980 
that's the way they operated they would
philosophize<00:05:07.569> bother

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
philosophize bother

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.330 
philosophize bother
they'd<00:05:08.139> think<00:05:08.379> about<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:08.949> they<00:05:09.009> decided

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
they'd think about it and they decided

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.439 
they'd think about it and they decided
heavier<00:05:10.270> objects<00:05:10.689> fall<00:05:10.719> faster<00:05:12.090> so<00:05:13.090> much<00:05:13.300> up

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
heavier objects fall faster so much up

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.909 
heavier objects fall faster so much up
David<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.050> Jason<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.080> had<00:05:17.259> them<00:05:17.409> jump<00:05:17.800> off

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
David and Jason and I had them jump off

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.719 
David and Jason and I had them jump off
the<00:05:18.039> table<00:05:18.339> the<00:05:18.430> same<00:05:18.610> time<00:05:18.900> dick<00:05:20.580> my<00:05:21.580> head

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
the table the same time dick my head

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.070 
the table the same time dick my head
didn't<00:05:22.000> jump<00:05:22.180> off<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.479> table<00:05:22.779> at<00:05:22.839> the<00:05:22.900> same

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
didn't jump off the table at the same

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.409 
didn't jump off the table at the same
time<00:05:25.319> which<00:05:26.319> one<00:05:26.499> would<00:05:26.589> land<00:05:26.830> first<00:05:27.330> do<00:05:28.330> we

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
time which one would land first do we

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.369 
time which one would land first do we
know<00:05:28.539> yet<00:05:28.659> as<00:05:28.779> we<00:05:28.930> come<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.199> a<00:05:29.259> conclusion

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
know yet as we come to a conclusion

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.100 
know yet as we come to a conclusion
which<00:05:29.889> football<00:05:30.219> saucer<00:05:30.659> no<00:05:31.659> we<00:05:31.810> still<00:05:32.080> have

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
which football saucer no we still have

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.379 
which football saucer no we still have
to<00:05:32.319> do<00:05:32.439> this<00:05:32.560> experiment<00:05:32.919> right<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.939> the<00:05:34.089> the

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
to do this experiment right and the the

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.499 
to do this experiment right and the the
idea<00:05:34.719> is<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:35.550> Darussalam<00:05:36.550> 2,000<00:05:37.120> years<00:05:37.330> for

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
idea is that Darussalam 2,000 years for

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.719 
idea is that Darussalam 2,000 years for
about<00:05:37.599> 2,000<00:05:38.289> years

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
about 2,000 years

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.079 
about 2,000 years
we<00:05:39.729> just<00:05:40.289> bought<00:05:41.289> by<00:05:41.319> no<00:05:42.159> one<00:05:42.250> actually<00:05:42.460> every
