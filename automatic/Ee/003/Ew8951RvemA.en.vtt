00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.820
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.540
 let us return to the approval of the lady an Italian system 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.490
 1 wedge deeply 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:12.790
 before 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.009
 and that of shooting 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.339
 it is 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.519
 one of the most compelling and spectacular 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.480
 but we will no longer talk on TV 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.939
 simple 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 I would gladly try second intention days 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269
 that require however 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 a certain what is the site to be seen 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.300
 so we have to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.160
 to push 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.940
 mental effort cost 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
 to rebuild positions 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 of course 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.680
 let's start with things anyway 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.190
 quite 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.730
 linear 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.780
 then 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 first i have kind of shot that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.010
 study 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010
 since when by which they believed in a row 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.110
 some texts 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.310
 to tap to perform 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
 a final hold 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120
 if we look at serramanna 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.760
 we can imagine that there was a biodynamic here 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 we will not be able to do things without resolving 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 and the Negro penalty 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 we can bring it 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.180
 and this is it 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 with two strokes with two passages we carry it in this thing is the key 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.820
 give one 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 federico the first offer of tex 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.270
 in other regions 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.190
 here is the second pre-exam 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.060
 the second intention 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.380
 and here is the first one 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.760
 acum 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 of these smes mechanisms we can create many 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.130
 we certainly have no claim 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.650
 want to sourire 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.799
 all standing possible during a game because they are 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.790
 finished 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.040
 if not infinite anyway 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.400
 great 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.890
 of course 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.410
 some techniques 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.619
 we want to show it 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.769
 watch it 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.549
 I show the same technique but move to the other side 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.399
 oporto portugal emirates 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.189
 the rice technique use this shot 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.009
 in the same as before 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.119
 penis 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.769
 we will bring a piece b 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.119
 berlusconi ruby 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.189
 to make a pirlata 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.979
 then we will put between pes in line 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.979
 the simplest major so 1 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.529
 let's feed 2 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.689
 we still eat 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.129
 and here you are practicing at your blue position 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
 the final brisa 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.799
 these two examples were simple 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.799
 we want to complete things a bit 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.919
 let's look at presented 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.919
 such a position 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.709
 these things are 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.709
 mappy - more complex 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.119
 we need to have 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 I look for job tarot of the attraction 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:22.149
 as it is the thing can think if this were true 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:23.860
 then we could not 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.269
 feed again with dick 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.809
 and see what happens 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.359
 first piece 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.039
 and here is that 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.339
 we hold the key position 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:35.969
 second half 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.949
 look at my novel from here and we'll eat 3 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.099
 or tribute to this part 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.099
 not to say it does not seem 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.779
 a double chance 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.219
 single result 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.409
 very true 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.409
 last example 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.509
 a little more complicated 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.849
 caution 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.879
 the vision of the fifa 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.719
 alternative universe 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.980
 adoption saludos look at the victory you get 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.870
 giving food 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.120
 this crazy unpaid in the world is changing the lady you do not move 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.710
 but download subs 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.460
 and I the council of the vb 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.009
 little to eat d 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.199
 if I eat this way 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.199
 the simple flower similar to those we have seen 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.910
 so goes with text 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.849
 and here is the socket 3 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.659
 but as we have said 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.509
 - an other possibility 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.520
 let's feed the black like going this way also 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:51.620
 and bay comment 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.389
 in this situation 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.210
 new 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.800
 we take a body 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 as seen in favorites we go to eat pawn pasta 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.099
 iroko eat this way 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.270
 tribute to this other part 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.180
 the solution is always the same 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.370
 it is always open 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.510
 as you see 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.670
 different chances different choices 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.270
 unit 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.270
 final solution 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 this is the first tv series series presented 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.740
 in the next meetings one of the others 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.139
 they look like simple men in monk we will go forward 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.469
 paths that fall more and more 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.299
 believe it
