good question and I think what it boils
down<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.369> Nintendo<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.360> any<00:01:15.630> other

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
down to is Nintendo or any other

developer major console developers

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.520 
developer major console developers
willingness<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.909> let<00:01:20.909> Apple<00:01:21.420> Android<00:01:21.990> Google

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
willingness to let Apple Android Google

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.090 
willingness to let Apple Android Google
take<00:01:22.880> 30%<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.060> those<00:01:24.240> sales<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.170> everybody

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
take 30% of those sales so everybody

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.609 
take 30% of those sales so everybody
through<00:01:26.369> Apple<00:01:26.700> has<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> give<00:01:27.119> 30%<00:01:27.450> same<00:01:28.350> thing

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
through Apple has to give 30% same thing

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
through Apple has to give 30% same thing
with<00:01:28.860> Android<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.729> guessing<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> same<00:01:30.540> thing

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
with Android I'm guessing the same thing

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
with Android I'm guessing the same thing
with<00:01:30.960> Amazon<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:33.180> likely

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
with Amazon so it's not really likely

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
with Amazon so it's not really likely
that<00:01:33.869> we'll<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> Nintendo<00:01:35.070> who<00:01:35.400> generally

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that we'll see a Nintendo who generally

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
that we'll see a Nintendo who generally
speaking<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:37.140> protective<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:38.009> those

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
speaking is really protective of those

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.359 
speaking is really protective of those
first<00:01:38.520> party<00:01:38.939> IPs<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.810> Mario<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> bring

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
first party IPs like Mario and bring

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
first party IPs like Mario and bring
them<00:01:41.579> over<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.180> iOS<00:01:42.540> even<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
them over to iOS even with that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
them over to iOS even with that
controller<00:01:43.680> support<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
controller support I think the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
controller support I think the
controller<00:01:45.180> support<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.780> iOS<00:01:45.869> 7<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.649> really

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
controller support for iOS 7 is really

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.010 
controller support for iOS 7 is really
exciting<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.759> indie<00:01:48.030> developers<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> people

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
exciting for indie developers and people

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
exciting for indie developers and people
who<00:01:49.320> make<00:01:49.590> games<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.850> actually

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
who make games that can be actually

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.780 
who make games that can be actually
enhanced<00:01:52.439> by<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> controller<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> sometimes

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
enhanced by a controller and sometimes

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
enhanced by a controller and sometimes
touch<00:01:54.360> gaming<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.259> exactly<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
touch gaming is not exactly the way that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
touch gaming is not exactly the way that
you'd<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> play<00:01:57.090> say<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> side-scrolling

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you'd want to play say a side-scrolling

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
you'd want to play say a side-scrolling
platformer<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.549> generally<00:02:00.000> speaking<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
platformer I think generally speaking I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.090 
platformer I think generally speaking I
wouldn't<00:02:00.810> hold<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.049> breath<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.590> those

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
wouldn't hold your breath on those

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
wouldn't hold your breath on those
titles<00:02:02.610> those<00:02:02.850> first<00:02:03.119> party<00:02:03.420> titles<00:02:03.780> from

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
definitely a little bit lacking so it's

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.930 
definitely a little bit lacking so it's
kind<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.320> behind<00:04:46.650> in<00:04:46.860> terms<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.280> processor

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
kind of behind in terms of processor

and<00:04:58.050> expand<00:04:58.620> their<00:04:58.950> software<00:04:59.490> to<00:05:00.090> really<00:05:00.360> take

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
and expand their software to really take

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.370 
and expand their software to really take
advantage<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.890> what<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.310> Ouya<00:05:02.880> x'<00:05:02.940> idea<00:05:03.900> can

needs to have a demo and a lot of times

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.620 
needs to have a demo and a lot of times
in<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.830> family<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.760> definitely<00:05:12.300> want<00:05:12.450> that

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.660 
that the game that you're about to buy
even<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.410> it's<00:05:16.560> only<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.860> dollar<00:05:17.280> or<00:05:17.640> two

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
even if it's only a dollar or two

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.360 
even if it's only a dollar or two

think<00:05:20.610> Lea<00:05:21.000> can<00:05:21.240> absolutely<00:05:21.990> expand<00:05:22.770> on<00:05:22.920> their

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
think Lea can absolutely expand on their

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.850 
think Lea can absolutely expand on their
services<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.820> think<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.540> they<00:05:24.690> can<00:05:24.900> combine<00:05:25.170> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
services I think if they can combine the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.530 
services I think if they can combine the
console<00:05:26.520> part<00:05:26.820> of<00:05:26.970> booyah

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
console part of booyah

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.390 
console part of booyah
which<00:05:27.840> is<00:05:27.990> what<00:05:28.140> they<00:05:28.230> have<00:05:28.380> now<00:05:28.620> with

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
which is what they have now with

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400 
which is what they have now with
something<00:05:29.880> along<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.420> lines<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.720> an<00:05:30.840> Apple<00:05:31.200> TV
