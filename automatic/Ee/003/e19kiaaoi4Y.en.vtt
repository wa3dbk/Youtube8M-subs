much the the you power saving for ultra

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.830 
much the the you power saving for ultra
power<00:01:10.020> saving<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:12.510> know<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> could

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
power saving I would you know you could

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
power saving I would you know you could
definitely<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.290> use<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.189> those

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
definitely get use out of that for those

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
definitely get use out of that for those
situations<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.180> basically<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.200> tap<00:01:16.530> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
situations so basically you just tap on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
situations so basically you just tap on
it<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.009> toggle<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it to toggle it now here it is right now

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
it to toggle it now here it is right now
I<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.650> eighty<00:01:19.979> percent<00:01:20.520> eighty<00:01:20.759> eight

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I have eighty percent eighty eight

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
I have eighty percent eighty eight
percent<00:01:21.150> battery<00:01:21.540> left<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.380> telling<00:01:22.650> me<00:01:22.710> if

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
percent battery left it's telling me if

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
percent battery left it's telling me if
I<00:01:22.890> were<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.280> into<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> mode<00:01:24.080> which<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I were to go into this mode which I

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.539 
I were to go into this mode which I
wouldn't<00:01:25.530> normally<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.340> particular

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
wouldn't normally do in this particular

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.109 
wouldn't normally do in this particular
case<00:01:27.439> but<00:01:28.439> let's<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.009> say<00:01:29.189> let's<00:01:30.000> say<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
case but let's just say let's say I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.690 
case but let's just say let's say I
would<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.689> say<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.350> 11<00:01:31.860> days<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
would it would say I have 11 days that I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.929 
would it would say I have 11 days that I
can<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.290> without<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.100> battery<00:01:35.280> running<00:01:35.700> out

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
can go without the battery running out

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.600 
can go without the battery running out
on<00:01:36.150> me<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:37.130> normally<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.189> want<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> toggle

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
on me and normally you want to toggle

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.960 
on me and normally you want to toggle
this<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.270> maybe<00:01:39.600> 10%<00:01:40.259> left<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.740> 15%<00:01:41.100> left<00:01:41.610> from

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
this at maybe 10% left or 15% left from

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
this at maybe 10% left or 15% left from
what<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.750> no<00:01:42.899> setting<00:01:43.470> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
what I can see there's no setting for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.530 
what I can see there's no setting for
this<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> automatically<00:01:44.549> kick<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this to automatically kick in like the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.410 
this to automatically kick in like the
HTC<00:01:46.140> One<00:01:46.829> m8<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.790> understand<00:01:48.240> why

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
HTC One m8 so I don't understand why

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.530 
HTC One m8 so I don't understand why
they<00:01:48.600> didn't<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.520> but<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> some

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
they didn't do that but if there is some

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
they didn't do that but if there is some
way<00:01:51.689> somebody<00:01:52.170> comment<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> video

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
way somebody comment on the video

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
way somebody comment on the video
because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:56.659> what<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> will

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because I just don't see it what it will

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
because I just don't see it what it will
do<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.469> make<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.860> screen

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
do is it's gonna make this screen

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
do is it's gonna make this screen
grayscale<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> first<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> no

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
grayscale that's the first thing so no

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.230 
grayscale that's the first thing so no
more<00:02:01.380> color<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> display<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.180> to

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.620 
can see the display went off pretty
quickly<00:04:02.470> there<00:04:02.769> too<00:04:03.010> because<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.970> set<00:04:04.480> my

normally<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.780> don't<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.260> but<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.560> do<00:04:11.680> that

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
normally I don't do that but I do that

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.349 
normally I don't do that but I do that
because<00:04:12.099> I'm<00:04:12.280> doing<00:04:12.519> video<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.000> doesn't<00:04:13.269> go

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
because I'm doing video so it doesn't go

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.050 
because I'm doing video so it doesn't go
off<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:14.230> so<00:04:15.069> those<00:04:15.250> are<00:04:15.370> that's<00:04:15.549> the<00:04:15.700> settings
