00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 his surprise the officers arrested and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.890
 what is said 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.590
 a baby who does not understand can not 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.739
 He came back with the support of organizations 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.999
 Community that published the case and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.689

 total and the only reason they released him 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.079
 I do not know why they took him but not 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.730
 they let go because we pressured them the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:53.269
 community had to join and shout for 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.400

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.769
 what's going to happen that is going to be theirs 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.080

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.880
