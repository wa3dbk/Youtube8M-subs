we're going to add 150 milliliters of
silver<00:00:17.400> nitrate<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.330> beaker<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:21.480> that

we're going to add 75 milliliters of
potassium<00:00:24.660> hydroxide<00:00:26.779> when<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.380> a

potassium hydroxide when we do so a
precipitate<00:00:29.310> forms<00:00:29.900> we're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> add

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
precipitate forms we're going to add

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.299 
precipitate forms we're going to add
some<00:00:31.430> concentrated<00:00:32.430> ammonium<00:00:33.059> hydroxide

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
some concentrated ammonium hydroxide

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
some concentrated ammonium hydroxide
until<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> precipitate<00:00:36.120> dissolves

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.450 

the<00:01:00.550> precipitate<00:01:01.240> has<00:01:01.450> now<00:01:01.630> dissolved<00:01:02.080> in<00:01:02.470> a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
the precipitate has now dissolved in a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.650 
the precipitate has now dissolved in a
very<00:01:03.790> clean<00:01:04.230> flask<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.880> has<00:01:07.030> been<00:01:07.240> rinsed

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
very clean flask which has been rinsed

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.390 
very clean flask which has been rinsed
and<00:01:07.840> cleaned<00:01:08.260> with<00:01:08.500> nitric<00:01:08.890> acid<00:01:09.310> and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
and cleaned with nitric acid and

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.690 
and cleaned with nitric acid and
distilled<00:01:09.790> water<00:01:10.350> we're<00:01:11.350> going<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.710> add<00:01:11.800> 50

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
distilled water we're going to add 50

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.690 
distilled water we're going to add 50
milliliters<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.330> our<00:01:14.340> reducing<00:01:15.340> sugar

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
milliliters of our reducing sugar

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.630 
milliliters of our reducing sugar
dextrose<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:18.340> that<00:01:18.550> solution<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:21.280> going<00:01:21.430> to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
dextrose to that solution we're going to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.330 
dextrose to that solution we're going to
add<00:01:21.790> our<00:01:23.160> alkaline<00:01:24.510> silver<00:01:25.510> nitrate<00:01:25.540> solution

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.300 

now<00:01:30.340> stopper<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.970> flask<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:34.920> agitate<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.950> for

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
now stopper the flask and agitate it for

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.750 
now stopper the flask and agitate it for
several<00:01:36.670> minutes<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:38.320> order<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.890> produce<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
several minutes in order to produce the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:02:09.820 
several minutes in order to produce the
silver<00:01:40.479> mirror

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.340 

so<00:02:10.430> we<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.360> silver<00:02:11.690> ion<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
so we can see that the silver ion in the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.510 
so we can see that the silver ion in the
silver<00:02:12.770> nitrate<00:02:13.060> has<00:02:14.740> changed<00:02:15.740> into<00:02:16.130> silver

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
silver nitrate has changed into silver

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.110 
silver nitrate has changed into silver
metal<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:17.180> been<00:02:17.450> reduced<00:02:17.870> as<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:19.120> aldehyde

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
metal it's been reduced as the aldehyde

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.750 
metal it's been reduced as the aldehyde
group<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> dextrose<00:02:21.290> was<00:02:21.620> oxidized<00:02:24.760> let's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
group in the dextrose was oxidized let's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.670 
group in the dextrose was oxidized let's
lay<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> pen<00:02:26.270> down<00:02:26.300> there<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.470> see

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
lay a pen down there so that you can see

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.660 
lay a pen down there so that you can see
the<00:02:27.830> reflection<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.610> let<00:02:29.540> me<00:02:29.690> show<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.670> what

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
the reflection and let me show you what

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.420 
the reflection and let me show you what
it<00:02:31.790> looked<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.060> before<00:02:32.740> we<00:02:33.740> began<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
it looked like before we began the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.120 
it looked like before we began the
demonstration
