00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.860 
green card therefore we haven't had that
in<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> history<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> fifa<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.270> maybe<00:03:12.420> they

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
in the history of fifa so maybe they

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.050 
in the history of fifa so maybe they
could<00:03:13.020> produce<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.709> if<00:03:13.770> EA<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.700> forward

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
could produce that and if EA get forward

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.850 
could produce that and if EA get forward
this<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.990> then<00:03:16.140> hopefully<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:16.800> do

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
this and see it then hopefully they do

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.190 
this and see it then hopefully they do
think<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.520> good<00:03:17.610> idea<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.510> guys<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:19.020> to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
think it's a good idea you guys want to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
think it's a good idea you guys want to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
make your own cars you can never go too

make your own cars you can never go too
