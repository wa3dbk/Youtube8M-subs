00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.360
 why do we have weapons this is the temple of speed the tifosi all 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.369
 around the circuit fooled overtaking 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.699
 11 am this one give 53% 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.960
 307 kilometers in total 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.739
 four long straight lines 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.509
 slow turns 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.220
 two possibilities of passing 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.519
 maximum speed of 350 street tran 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.970
 here is his answer 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.970
 Italy is a point of circuit tours 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.040
 we get there in the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.060
 we are at a brake of this circuit of monza 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.130
 very very big violent braking of these demands 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.130
 to slow down as much as possible by car to take goals 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 it's a closed place 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 I do not really like this very difficult to drive for the car 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 we are really trying to get back from the state 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.310
 we would arrive in another chicane who is also very very 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.300
 important for the trot that we can make a big difference we do not arrive 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.530
 really to spend on these shields drink as much as possible 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.530
 this part there are two quick turns down cjo 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.430
 but it's very difficult to fly because the car has very little 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 aerodynamic support for long straight lines 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 and therefore early in the meeting are another 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.330
 the ascari chicane a baffle very quickly 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.780
 it's not easy to fly and curbs learn 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 That's right 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.810
 maintain a chicane at over 200 kilometers an hour 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 but it's really one of the most beautiful circuits in the world 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.910
 we arrive now in the last corner of this circuit of monza 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.520
 where there we try to look beyond speed and our common stand out the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 as much as possible because the road to the end 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.660
 to combine long standoff on the left and with all the spectators it's really 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.240
 me 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.189
 a superb circuit
