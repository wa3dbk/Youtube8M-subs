any difference if everyone took their

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.230 
any difference if everyone took their
money<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> bank<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> lender<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.290 

what<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> real<00:01:20.040> solution<00:01:20.400> real<00:01:20.850> solution

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
what is the real solution real solution

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.150 
what is the real solution real solution
is<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:22.880> free<00:01:23.880> market<00:01:24.060> solution<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> reason<00:01:27.090> why

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
is a free market solution the reason why

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.950 
is a free market solution the reason why
starving<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.250> bees<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:30.120> doing<00:01:30.510> anything

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
means of protest basically just like

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.400 
means of protest basically just like
starvation<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.930> not<00:01:42.930> well<00:01:43.260> not

non-voting with your money is not a an

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.600 
non-voting with your money is not a an
effective<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.620> harder<00:01:50.580> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
effective way because it's harder to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.330 
effective way because it's harder to
recruit<00:01:51.300> people<00:01:51.330> into<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:53.210> particular

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
make change we have to provide a

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
make change we have to provide a
solution<00:02:25.010> which<00:02:26.010> allows<00:02:26.370> people<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.000> grow<00:02:28.010> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
solution which allows people to grow and
