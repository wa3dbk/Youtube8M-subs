actually<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> smoky

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually is so as you can see the smoky

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually is so as you can see the smoky
palette<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.299> definitely<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.200> cool

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
palette is definitely a lot more cool

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
palette is definitely a lot more cool
tone<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.759> warm<00:01:39.030> tones<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.540> side

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
tone they do have warm tones this side

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.899 
tone they do have warm tones this side
and<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> couple<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.729> original

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and a couple this side but the original

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
and a couple this side but the original
Naked<00:01:42.450> palette<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.020> more<00:01:43.140> warm<00:01:43.439> until

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
Naked palette was a lot more warm until

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
Naked palette was a lot more warm until
the<00:01:43.920> very<00:01:44.070> end<00:01:44.189> whereas<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> lot

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the very end whereas this one is a lot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
the very end whereas this one is a lot
more<00:01:45.659> cool<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> initial<00:01:47.189> outlook<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
more cool so this is initial outlook of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
more cool so this is initial outlook of
the<00:01:48.689> original<00:01:49.079> pallet<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> top<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.829> these

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the original pallet on the top and these

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
the original pallet on the top and these
smoky<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> bottom<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> top<00:01:53.100> now

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
smoky on at the bottom so on the top now

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
smoky on at the bottom so on the top now
we<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> Naked<00:01:54.270> 2<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> bottom<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
we have the Naked 2 and on the bottom is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.010 
we have the Naked 2 and on the bottom is
the<00:01:55.500> smoky<00:01:56.009> iCarly's<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.090> too<00:01:57.299> many<00:01:57.479> major

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the smoky iCarly's you too many major

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.749 
the smoky iCarly's you too many major
similarities<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:59.009> tones<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.640> very

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
similarities two tones are very very

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.760 
similarities two tones are very very
different<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.390> both<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
different in both of these there is

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
different in both of these there is
possibly<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> odd<00:02:02.700> color<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.420> kind<00:02:03.659> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
possibly the odd color that are kind of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
possibly the odd color that are kind of
similar<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.590> say<00:02:04.799> generally<00:02:05.100> if

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
similar but I would say generally if

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
similar but I would say generally if
you're<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.450> either<00:02:06.750> these

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you're going to go with either these

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.449 
you're going to go with either these
pallets<00:02:07.619> then<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.429> for

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
pallets then you just have to go for

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
pallets then you just have to go for
which<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.420> prefer<00:02:09.569> because<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.259> are

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
which one you prefer because they are

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.720 
which one you prefer because they are
very<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:10.739> different<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
very very different you do you have a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.059 
very very different you do you have a
black<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.810> highlight<00:02:13.470> color<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.800> BO

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
black and a highlight color in BO

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.500 
black and a highlight color in BO
but<00:02:14.219> they<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.400> different<00:02:14.430> tones<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.299> them

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
but they have different tones in them

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.259 
but they have different tones in them
and<00:02:15.780> yes<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.069> Naked<00:02:17.579> 2<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.209> is

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
and yes this is the Naked 2 and this is

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.319 
and yes this is the Naked 2 and this is
the<00:02:18.510> smoky<00:02:19.019> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> bottom<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
the smoky on the bottom now we have the

the smoky on the bottom now we have the
negative<00:02:21.719> 3<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> top<00:02:22.469> and<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.829> smoke<00:02:23.069> on

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
negative 3 on the top and the smoke on

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.220 
negative 3 on the top and the smoke on
the<00:02:23.310> bottom<00:02:23.639> again<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.749> see<00:02:24.900> too<00:02:25.079> many

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the bottom again I really see too many

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
the bottom again I really see too many
similarities<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.980> highlight<00:02:26.340> colors<00:02:26.609> are

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
similarities the highlight colors are

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
similarities the highlight colors are
quite<00:02:27.180> similar<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.840> both<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.409> pallets<00:02:28.829> but<00:02:29.310> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
quite similar in both the pallets but I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.069 
quite similar in both the pallets but I
can't<00:02:29.579> say<00:02:29.819> there's<00:02:30.030> any<00:02:30.180> real<00:02:30.480> similarity

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
can't say there's any real similarity

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.379 
can't say there's any real similarity
that's<00:02:31.260> very<00:02:31.439> very<00:02:31.560> rosy<00:02:31.859> tones<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:33.000> naked

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
that's very very rosy tones in the naked

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.809 
that's very very rosy tones in the naked
3<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.870> obviously<00:02:34.469> more<00:02:34.590> smokier<00:02:35.129> colors<00:02:35.639> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
3 and obviously more smokier colors and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.479 
3 and obviously more smokier colors and
a<00:02:35.939> broader<00:02:36.510> range<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.870> colors<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.799> smoky

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
a broader range of colors in the smoky

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.839 
a broader range of colors in the smoky
one<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.379> this<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.469> a<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:40.709> overview<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.639> the

but it just comes off as a really really

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.450 
but it just comes off as a really really
nice<00:04:30.990> color<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.560> next<00:04:31.830> one<00:04:32.010> we<00:04:32.100> have<00:04:32.250> black

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
nice color and next one we have black

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.060 
nice color and next one we have black
market<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.090> it's<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.780> very<00:04:33.840> very<00:04:34.139> strong<00:04:34.380> black

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
market and it's a very very strong black

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.850 
market and it's a very very strong black
color<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:35.820> not<00:04:36.750> got<00:04:36.930> too<00:04:37.050> much<00:04:37.230> shimmer<00:04:37.620> in

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
color it's not got too much shimmer in

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.350 
color it's not got too much shimmer in
it<00:04:37.889> there<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.250> slight<00:04:38.639> sheen<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.060> I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
it there is a slight sheen but I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.170 
it there is a slight sheen but I
wouldn't<00:04:39.690> call<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.139> shimmer<00:04:40.940> next<00:04:41.940> along

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
wouldn't call it a shimmer next along

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.000 
wouldn't call it a shimmer next along
there<00:04:42.480> is<00:04:42.600> smolder<00:04:43.110> which<00:04:43.350> again<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.680> think<00:04:43.800> is

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
there is smolder which again I think is

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.200 
there is smolder which again I think is
a<00:04:44.040> really<00:04:44.220> really<00:04:44.430> nice<00:04:44.550> colorful<00:04:45.060> maybe

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
a really really nice colorful maybe

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.530 
a really really nice colorful maybe
blending<00:04:45.690> out<00:04:45.810> i'll<00:04:45.960> put<00:04:45.990> him<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.530> outer<00:04:46.710> V

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
blending out i'll put him in the outer V

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.379 
blending out i'll put him in the outer V
then<00:04:48.540> we<00:04:48.720> have<00:04:48.930> password<00:04:49.820> which<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> really

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
then we have password which is a really

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.240 
then we have password which is a really
really<00:04:51.570> nice<00:04:51.720> color<00:04:52.020> as<00:04:52.200> well<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.710> think<00:04:53.040> this

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
really nice color as well I think this

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.159 
really nice color as well I think this
one<00:04:53.460> was<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.700> bit<00:04:54.000> harder<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.419> swatch<00:04:54.840> as<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.080> was

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
one was a bit harder to swatch as it was

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.659 
one was a bit harder to swatch as it was
on<00:04:55.200> my<00:04:55.380> thumb<00:04:55.620> so<00:04:55.860> excuse<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.250> fact<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.520> it

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
on my thumb so excuse the fact that it

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.540 
on my thumb so excuse the fact that it
looks<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.180> even<00:04:57.570> bigger<00:04:57.780> swatch<00:04:58.370> then<00:04:59.370> we

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
looks like a even bigger swatch then we

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.650 
looks like a even bigger swatch then we
have<00:04:59.760> whiskey<00:05:00.800> combust<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.150> 13<00:05:03.150> which<00:05:03.480> are

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
have whiskey combust and 13 which are

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.450 
have whiskey combust and 13 which are
all<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.200> matte<00:05:04.530> colors<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.070> last<00:05:05.250> four

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
all the matte colors the last four

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.390 
all the matte colors the last four
password<00:05:05.970> whiskey<00:05:06.419> combust<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:06.930> 13<00:05:07.800> these

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
password whiskey combust and 13 these

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.920 
password whiskey combust and 13 these
were<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:08.669> super<00:05:09.120> silky<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.570> as<00:05:09.660> you<00:05:09.750> can<00:05:09.900> see

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
were all super silky and as you can see

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.720 
were all super silky and as you can see
I'm<00:05:10.140> really<00:05:10.380> impressed<00:05:10.560> with<00:05:10.710> 13<00:05:11.160> because<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
I'm really impressed with 13 because the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.640 
I'm really impressed with 13 because the
color<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.360> vibrant<00:05:12.600> considering<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.590> a

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
color is so vibrant considering is a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.920 
color is so vibrant considering is a
very<00:05:14.190> pale<00:05:14.400> color<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.330> think<00:05:15.510> combust<00:05:15.810> is

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
very pale color and I think combust is

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.510 
very pale color and I think combust is
going<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:16.140> be<00:05:16.200> really<00:05:16.380> nice<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:16.860> for<00:05:17.010> blending

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
going to be really nice one for blending

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.460 
going to be really nice one for blending
it<00:05:18.000> kind<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.300> blends<00:05:18.540> into<00:05:18.660> my<00:05:18.840> skin<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.140> bit<00:05:19.200> but

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
it kind of blends into my skin a bit but

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.980 
it kind of blends into my skin a bit but
it<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.680> kind<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:19.919> a<00:05:19.979> movie<00:05:20.400> color<00:05:20.729> but<00:05:21.120> here<00:05:21.840> is

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
it is kind of a movie color but here is

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.320 
it is kind of a movie color but here is
another<00:05:22.020> overview<00:05:22.919> of<00:05:23.100> all<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.700> colors<00:05:24.210> I

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
another overview of all of the colors I

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330 
another overview of all of the colors I
think<00:05:24.600> all<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.780> them<00:05:25.050> show<00:05:25.650> up<00:05:25.680> really<00:05:26.100> well

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
think all of them show up really well

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.100 
think all of them show up really well
except<00:05:27.000> i<00:05:27.150> did<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.570> slight<00:05:27.750> issue<00:05:27.930> with

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
except i did have the slight issue with

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.890 
except i did have the slight issue with
radar<00:05:28.919> which<00:05:29.639> didn't<00:05:30.060> really<00:05:30.090> seem<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.780> be<00:05:30.870> a

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
radar which didn't really seem to be a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.260 
radar which didn't really seem to be a
silky<00:05:31.380> as<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.710> rest<00:05:31.979> so<00:05:32.550> I'm<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:32.700> more<00:05:32.880> silky

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
silky as the rest so I'm a more silky

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.880 
silky as the rest so I'm a more silky
than<00:05:33.419> others<00:05:33.630> more<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.200> matte<00:05:34.380> ones<00:05:34.560> are

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
than others more so the matte ones are

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.219 
than others more so the matte ones are
the<00:05:35.070> most<00:05:35.250> silky<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:35.850> radar<00:05:36.270> in<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.570> center

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
the most silky but radar in the center

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.500 
the most silky but radar in the center
there<00:05:37.380> was<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.890> bit<00:05:38.250> hard<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.610> kind<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.240> blend

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
there was a bit hard to kind of blend

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.830 
there was a bit hard to kind of blend
out<00:05:39.780> but<00:05:40.169> here's<00:05:40.650> an<00:05:40.860> overview<00:05:41.720> today<00:05:42.720> we're

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840
