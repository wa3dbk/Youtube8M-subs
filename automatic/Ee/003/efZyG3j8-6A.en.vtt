00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm looking at all of you ... 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 ... and I've seen the stainsof this long-lasting war. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.700
 If we die tonight ... 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.300
 ... humanity dies with us. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 Machines, to kill my mother, Sarah Connor ... 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600
 ... sent a Terminator to a time before the war. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 Sir, let me save him. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
 What you do now can end the war. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 He was frightened and weak. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 Look after her for me, Kyle. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.800
 Come with me if you want to live! 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 Now, soldier! 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
 NEXT SUMMER 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 John sent me to save you. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.100
 The Terminator who's gonna kill me. 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 I know, but we've already taken care of him. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.100
 We? 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 I was waiting for you. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.800
 RULES 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800
 John's sending you back is no longer. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600
 Everything has changed. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 RENEWED 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.000
 We can stop Judgment Day from happening. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.400
 Run! 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.200
 Where is she?! 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.200
 TERMINATOR 5: GENÄ°SYS 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.200
