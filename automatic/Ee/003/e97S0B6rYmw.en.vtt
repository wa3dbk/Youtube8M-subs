a<00:00:55.910> little<00:00:56.149> switch<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:03.280> all<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.309> have<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.640> do<00:01:05.000> is

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
a little switch and all I have to do is

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.260 
a little switch and all I have to do is

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
flower because I think that shows up

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.029 
flower because I think that shows up
more<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:11.660> can<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:12.050> it's<00:01:12.259> scanning<00:01:12.709> in

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
more and you can see it's scanning in

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.290 
more and you can see it's scanning in
the<00:01:13.459> flower<00:01:14.709> and<00:01:15.709> I<00:01:16.429> looked<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:16.729> my<00:01:16.849> flower<00:01:17.119> and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
the flower and I looked at my flower and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.900 
the flower and I looked at my flower and
I<00:01:17.479> knew<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> was<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.869> little<00:01:18.110> too<00:01:18.410> big<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:19.039> I

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
I knew it was a little too big and I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.419 
I knew it was a little too big and I
thought<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:20.539> they<00:01:21.530> say<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:21.770> can<00:01:22.039> stitch<00:01:22.280> it

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
thought well they say I can stitch it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.490 
thought well they say I can stitch it
together<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.509> decided<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.020> give<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.349> a<00:01:24.380> try

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
together so I decided to give that a try

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.150 
together so I decided to give that a try
I<00:01:24.979> moved<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.060> up<00:01:26.179> I<00:01:26.770> press<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.950> green<00:01:28.099> button

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.850 
I moved it up I press the green button
again<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.840> can<00:01:29.990> see<00:01:30.050> now<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:30.830> is

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
again and you can see now that it is

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.480 
again and you can see now that it is
actually<00:01:31.190> scanning<00:01:31.729> twice

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.899 

and<00:01:37.579> as<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.390> scans<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:39.229> its<00:01:40.100> writing<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
and as it scans in its writing it to a

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.520 
and as it scans in its writing it to a
little<00:01:41.060> SD<00:01:41.540> card<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.079> side<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.439> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
it was very easy to do and it came up

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.650
