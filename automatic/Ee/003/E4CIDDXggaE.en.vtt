00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 ah 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 ah 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.850
 hello again 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.490
 today we bring you a recipe for clams 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.560
 the marinera an exquisite dish that 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.090
 like almost everyone and that not everything 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.380
 the world knows how to prepare then we have 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.480
 chosen a recipe for clams to the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.320
 very simple sailor so that we do not 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.110
 complicate good the first thing is to cut 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.239
 the works in chunks peppers we are going 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 to cut the garlic and the onion 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.430
 all very tiny for this recipe 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.580
 since we already have almost all garlic 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.480
 cut while we are exporting the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.820
 chive let's put about 100 grams 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.460
 of butter in the pan so that it 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.260
 we go melting so it is melting 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.589
 while we take advantage to cut the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.589
 spring onion 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.290
 we leave a cut in the middle 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.570
 and we make some plates 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.640
 but careful not to take us in 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640
 one finger 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.829
 we are also doing a little bit the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.829
 very tiny 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 good with everything already well minced we have 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.580
 the butter is already next to the pan 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.549
 we take our garlic and our chive 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.730
 and we started to force it very slowly 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.100
 that does not burn 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.530
 this has to be simmering all the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.290
 little while 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.720
 if we burn the chive and the garlic is going 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.720
 to give a bitter taste to the sauce 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 marinera and we do not want that, so with 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 love with dedication and with time 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.150
 You see slowly this will take us some 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.409
 5 minutes 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.409
 re fry all this 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.840
 well we have almost rebounded well 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.790
 golden our cd projekt to our 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.959
 low is the time to incorporate him now 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.959
 the pinch of salt 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.980
 a little salt 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.819
 a little bit of chopped parsley 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.819
 to color 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.860
 we have more gorditas 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.049
 a half teaspoon of flour 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.310
 we refer to the flour well 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.460
 As you can see, it has no difficulty and 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.500
 the result 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.600
 it's delicious 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 and now everything is fine repeat what 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.340
 let's do is incorporate our 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.960
 glass or half glass goes to tastes of 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.840
 white wine any white wine is 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.860
 OK 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.860
 nothing of expensive things 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.870
 and now we are going to reduce all this a 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.030
 little that we take the alcohol out of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.150
 we're going to reduce it another 2 or 3 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.440
 4 minutes as soon as it starts to boil 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.600
 we incorporate the fish stock 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.910
 in some of my videos I 've already 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.200
 taught to make a fish stock 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.690
 because for this recipe for example because 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.250
 it is fundamental we add as I said 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.150
 then the fish stock when there 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.939
 reduced this a little bit 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.230
 that cooks and we would finish the recipe 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.230
 incorporating the clams 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.639
 As you can see , we already have the reduction of 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.579
 wine almost finished 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.949
 You see the texture that the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.689
 salsa then now is the time to 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.689
 add our fish broth 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.080
 with a little step 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.389
 to half a kilo of clams we have 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 enough in this case I bought a 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.270
 fish shop some Japanese clams 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.290
 you have 40,000 types of clams 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.290
 and of all prices 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.860
 with this recipe you can also do in 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.810
 medium with clams you can incorporate 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.630
 also cockle or you can incorporate 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.009
 the typical chirla 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.979
 It's worth it too 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.169
 well that cook now another 23 minutes in 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.539
 When it starts to boil, we incorporate the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.539
 Clams and we will finish our recipe 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.420
 we have already made the whole basis of the 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.570
 seafood sauce as you see already takes 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.340
 cooking 23 minutes is the time to 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.470
 find our clams I have 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.530
 had an hour before soaking in water 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.230
 and go out and clean them a little as you see 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.410
 they are all clean and now nothing 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.190
 we cook another 34 minutes just to 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.700
 rapid fire so that they open well and 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.700
 we serve 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.940
 Well, they have already cooked, as you can see 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.550
 raised almost all the caldito are already 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.660
 now at the time of plating 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.660
 and to like it 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.280
 the mud house as it is 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 wonderfully well 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.810
 and here you have the result I hope that you 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.610
 go well and you like clams to the 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.610
