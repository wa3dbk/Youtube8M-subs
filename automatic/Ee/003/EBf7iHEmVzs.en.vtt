00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.220
 we come back with more 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.920
 abc rural before entering the block 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.019
 of correspondences we want to tell you that 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.869
 Paraguay is in a position to 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.380
 produce vegetables all year 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.960
 including tomato but for that you have to 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.849
 They have technology consulted me 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.179
 our day if Paraguay had 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.119
 varieties of good tomatoes and I told them 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.550
 yes and very good work done 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.440
 at that time in it today in the ipta 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.470
 they allow to have varieties of tomato 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.810
 Paraguayan first quality and now yes 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.750
 let's see the letters we have 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.610
 selected Mr. Caesar ArgÃ¼ello we 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.640
 wrote to rural abc.com.py and asks us 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.100
 Let's talk about quail breeding 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.660
 is estimated will gladly spend 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.420
 a very nice material that we did with 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.820
 Mr. Javier Frank not to mention 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.110
 how can the breeding of 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.790
 quail 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.270
 you can also participate 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.500
 remember write to us at rural abc.com.py 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.130
 and to participate in our raffles 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 remember on YouTube you go and see 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.800
 Sometimes rural or northern supply idea I like 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.800
 to participate in our draws 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.750
 and I started 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.510
 as a hobby it was like a hobby more or 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 less than with time later it became 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.520
 business more than 30 years ago I'm 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.970
 with the theme of quail the lord 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.229
 franco touched several points very 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.080
 important for those people 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.780
 interested in getting started in breeding 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.300
 quail and that are the system of 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.360
 production that uses physical space 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.970
 that the birds occupy and how much they produce 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.550
 a system that this system of cages for 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.869
 batteries that with this system in a 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 cubic meter can be between 280 to 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.610
 336 quail in a meter practically 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.950
 because you can put the cages on top 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.980
 can be estimated up to 7 and put 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.780
 one behind the other four are formed 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.580
 columns of seven cage each and in 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.230
 Each cage is set from 10 to 12 animals 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.880
 then it has between 280 to 336 animals 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 It depends on the amount that is charged and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.660
 with that amount of birds you can 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.990
 produce more or less between 20 and 25 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.020
 dozens easily of quail game 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.510
 and you can use any place of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.730
 the house a barbecue a barn but there 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 to have him protected totally closed 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.590
 because one of his enemies are cats 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 the cages used for production 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.020
 They are easy to handle mainly in 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.240
 the issue of cleanliness that is one of the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.790
 factors to consider if one wants 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.340
 start in the production of these 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.220
 cages have some trays that for the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.950
 cleaning is removed the tray is changed to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.840
 daily the system is super simple 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.850
 it has a floor it has inclined that pando 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 when he puts eggs he leaves directly 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.660
 outside passes under the feeder and this one 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.800
 they have automatic drinkers they have 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.530
 picks and wears that they take 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.990
 practically does not take any work 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.600
 extra the producer told us from the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.240
 how many days do they start producing 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.550
 quail and how much is the lifespan of 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.980
 the females as well as how much 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.740
 replacements are made good 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.260
 the quail usually in 30 days of 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.680
 born and are now an adult and at 45 days 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.659
 starts 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.239
 put eggs put every day 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.909
 throughout the year you can put two or 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.790
 three years more or less in good quantity 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.370
 with a high percentage after they continue 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.459
 putting but not already every day but 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.709
 we have a control that if it was 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.299
 a good producer like after you 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.950
 we use as reproducers because 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.250
 we know that these cornices will give us 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.629
 excellent offspring then we use it to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.689
 the quail practically at 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.189
 females until the last days because no 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.659
 we care, for example, not to put 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.549
 every day but every three days 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.560
 put two eggs or every four days 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.109
 put two eggs then we know that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 those games are this going to give good 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.240
 pups then we make a selection of 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.000
 that guy and we use the cornice 34 years 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.699
 easily some even with 5 or 6 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.490
 years are still producing the consultation of 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.009
 how replacements should be made and 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.039
 If you have an incubator , Mr. 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.759
 Frank told us the subject of incubation 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.919
 the incubation process lasts 17 days in 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.780
 two months are practically already in 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.310
 production normally we 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.440
 we make the Cuba 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 according to the needs of agreement 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.060
 to the orders that we have then in 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.340
 based on that we prepare the pups and what 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.310
 does with males and males 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.040
 usually one part is used for 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.800
 breeders and the relationship is a male 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.810
 with three or four females more or less 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.740
 the 60 days the males that are not going to 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:14.320
 allocate to reproducers they work and they 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.720
 they use a point to have for consumption 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.720
 very much in mind is the health of the birds 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.270
 and our interviewee explains how 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.830
 carries out this work the part of 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.660
 health of these animals practically 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.700
 they are isolated they are in cages not 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.830
 they step on the excrement are totally 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.470
 isolated are much more resistant than 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.820
 the chickens are sometimes given in the 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.420
 water through the system the water is given 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.050
 some vitamins or well 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.110
 antiparasitic and those things that 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.090
 normally you do not need to since 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.850
 previously are isolated are in the 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.520
 cage totally have no moisture no 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.560
 they have health problems mostly 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.080
 They are quite tough much more 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.450
 resistant that the hen the lord 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.940
 javier franco detailed that there are some 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.550
 very important points to consider 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.500
 to achieve greater production of 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.940
 eggs with the commercial balanced that 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.070
 we are having we are having a 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.860
 production of about 80 percent 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.900
 more or less the average because in 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.650
 some cases even reach up to 96 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.490
 97 percent but there are they are very 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.850
 sensible 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.160
 It depends on many factors to regulate 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.570
 the bet of the game have to be in 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.970
 a quiet place you do not have to 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.650
 miss the water the food then they 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.260
 produce if they have all the conditions 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.690
 adequate produce a lot 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.180
 in animal production one of the factors 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.070
 called bottlenecks is the 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.310
 marketing our interviewee 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.800
 He explained how he does to sell the 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.960
 quail eggs and at what price 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.290
 we have our our 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.270
 salons of sales as mouth of exit 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.760
 We have several stores selling 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.880
 farm animals quail chicks 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.260
 rabbits and those same places we use 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.340
 as mouths of exit of our 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.890
 products to which we directly 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.370
 we reach the consumer and the price 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.980
 quite accessible we put now is in 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.100
 about 4500 granny is dozen 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.090
 we are giving in our premises in the 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.490
 next program 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.650
 the producer will explain to us what they are 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.780
 the types of balanced that uses 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.510
 for breeding as they act before 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.340
 sudden temperature changes the use 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.340
 of manure and other subjects
