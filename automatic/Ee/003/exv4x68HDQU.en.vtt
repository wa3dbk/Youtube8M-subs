00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.340
 Is riding a motorcycle dangerous? 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 Unfortunately, yes ... and much! 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.800
 Two things lead to this: traffic and the bike itself. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.720
 Traffic is dangerous. Evidence is found every day in the newspapers, on the TVs and on the wheels of conversation. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.020
 Who here does not know someone who has not had an accident? 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.820
 Worse, it is expected that traffic will be dangerous. 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.020
 If we use as analogy the profession of each one, 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.840
 we study for years, do courses, work in the same segment, 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.840
 and even then, most of the time, we do not know everything, we are not always the best, 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.440
 and then we do something wrong. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.780
 So what can we expect from people as drivers? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.460
 No one stays for 4 years studying traffic, direction, let alone have a practical laboratory 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 to develop skill. 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.940
 To make matters worse, from an early age 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.720
 we see relatives and acquaintances making that one-minute stop in a forbidden place, 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 giving back in a way to save a few blocks, 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 drink and get out driving! 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.820
 Can you imagine the company where you work where no employee has training in your area? 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.080
 Would not it be a mess and with several mistakes? 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 Yeah ... this is our transit! 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.180
 The other thing that makes riding a motorcycle is something dangerous is the bike itself. 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.300
 To get an idea, it is much easier and safer to fly than riding a motorcycle. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.740
 To begin as a pilot are at least 4 months of course, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.780
 dozens of flight hours, with theoretical and practical assessments. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.960
 All this to start flying alone and in restricted space. 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.240
 To fly around, along with other aircraft, are more courses, more hours of training, more evidence. 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.940
 After all this radio is still used to communicate and know where each aircraft is. 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.740
 "... three five little Snacks" 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.300
 "affirmative, in your listening, aware, awaiting your passage" 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.200
 Already for motorcycle we do a mediocre course in moto schools 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.160
 a few hours of theory and practice, 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 and we are going to the traffic without knowing the bike, without knowing the traffic 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.760
 and leading to misbehavior learned from a child. 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.060
 To make matters worse ... riding a motorcycle SEEMS to be easy, 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.760
 It's just a big bike. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.500
 But it really is not! 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.460
 There are techniques and knowledge to make good turns, good braking and even good acceleration 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.200
 because in a closed, an incorrect crossing, a skid of tire, 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.760
 having knowledge and training could be the difference between returning home ... and not coming back! 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.420
 About the bike ... study! Seek guidance, learn, train. 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160
 Search more about something that, in addition to transportation, 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.380
 can become a passion and cause for great pleasure. 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.480
 We were not born to ride a motorcycle, but we can die for it. 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.100
 Traffic already ... we can contribute to it becoming better. 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.680
 Do not make "cracks," do not drink and drive, do not sew, 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.700
 give way to others. 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.160
 Our contribution is given by our behavior: 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.700
 giving good examples in driving the traffic to our children, 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.920
 reminding our relatives and friends to use the flasher ... always! 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.160
 We were not born for traffic ... but we can die for it.
