00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
take their hair and they wrap it around

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.789 
take their hair and they wrap it around
I'm<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.070> go<00:01:50.070> ahead<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> clip<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.759> hair

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
I'm going to go ahead and clip my hair

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.249 
I'm going to go ahead and clip my hair
to<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.009> bottom<00:01:53.490> section<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> then

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to this bottom section here and then

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
to this bottom section here and then
curl<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:56.520> hair<00:01:56.549> around<00:01:57.149> let's<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:59.090> well

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
curl my hair around let's see how well

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.130 
curl my hair around let's see how well
this<00:02:00.299> works

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.170 

well<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.570> ok<00:02:06.570> area<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.880> kind<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
well that was a ok area it's kind of

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.870 
well that was a ok area it's kind of
awkward<00:02:09.390> crawling<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:11.190> trying<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.490> get<00:02:11.760> your

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
awkward crawling or trying to get your

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.060 
awkward crawling or trying to get your
hair<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.180> thick<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.570> clamp<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.950> hold

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
hair is thick in the clamp I'm on hold

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.630 
hair is thick in the clamp I'm on hold
her<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.550> 10<00:02:14.850> seconds<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:17.310> will<00:02:17.460> see

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
her for about 10 seconds and we will see

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.680 
her for about 10 seconds and we will see
what<00:02:17.790> kind<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:19.400> wave<00:02:20.400> or<00:02:20.760> curl<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.300> get<00:02:23.030> ok<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
what kind of a wave or curl I get ok so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.500 
what kind of a wave or curl I get ok so
it's<00:02:24.810> almost<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.290> spiral<00:02:25.680> curl<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it's almost like a spiral curl but a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.830 
it's almost like a spiral curl but a
little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:28.430> more<00:02:29.430> open<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.780> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
little bit more open this is kind of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.830 
little bit more open this is kind of
strange<00:02:31.160> uh-huh<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:35.360> think<00:02:36.360> once<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.600> get<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
strange uh-huh I think once I get the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.590 
strange uh-huh I think once I get the
hang<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.530> will<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.670> nice

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.180 

alright<00:02:42.600> for<00:02:43.050> my<00:02:43.140> next<00:02:43.350> section<00:02:43.830> I'm<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
alright for my next section I'm going to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.730 
alright for my next section I'm going to
go<00:02:44.340> ahead<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.670> curl<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.510> towards<00:02:46.350> my<00:02:46.500> face

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
go ahead and curl this towards my face

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.790 
go ahead and curl this towards my face
so<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:48.150> waves<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.320> stick<00:02:49.620> together

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
so that the waves don't stick together

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.580 
so that the waves don't stick together
and<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> creates<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.820> bit<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.210> volume

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
and it creates a little bit more volume

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.760 
and it creates a little bit more volume
pin<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.800> under<00:02:53.930> second<00:02:54.930> curl<00:02:55.170> towards<00:02:55.620> my

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
pin this under second curl towards my

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:10.180 
pin this under second curl towards my
face

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.780 

other<00:03:10.910> side<00:03:11.180> again<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.190> my<00:03:13.460> right-hand

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
other side again this is my right-hand

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.320 
other side again this is my right-hand
side<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.960> I<00:03:15.320> want<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.950> have<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.730> clamp<00:03:16.970> facing

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
side so I want to have the clamp facing

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.680 
side so I want to have the clamp facing
upwards<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.140> curl<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.470> towards<00:03:18.770> my<00:03:18.890> face<00:03:19.690> pin

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
upwards to curl it towards my face pin

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.180 
upwards to curl it towards my face pin
the<00:03:20.840> end<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> hair<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:22.420> roll<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.810> iron

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the end of the hair and roll the iron

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:35.270 
the end of the hair and roll the iron
inward

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.260 

so<00:03:36.280> now<00:03:36.400> i'm<00:03:36.490> going<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.700> go<00:03:36.790> ahead<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
so now i'm going to go ahead and do the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.080 
so now i'm going to go ahead and do the
top<00:03:37.420> section<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:38.050> my<00:03:38.410> hair<00:03:38.790> what<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.880> going<00:03:40.030> to

center then what i'm going to do for

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.729 
center then what i'm going to do for
this<00:03:45.459> part<00:03:45.819> i'm<00:03:46.480> going<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.840> take<00:03:46.990> each<00:03:47.430> side

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
this part i'm going to take each side

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.970 
this part i'm going to take each side
break<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.920> up<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.910> two<00:03:52.590> loop<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.800> this

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
break it up in the two loop in this

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.250 
break it up in the two loop in this
front<00:03:54.310> section<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:55.120> don't<00:03:55.840> really<00:03:55.959> care<00:03:56.200> that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
front section I don't really care that

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.860 
front section I don't really care that
i'm<00:03:56.560> not<00:03:56.680> using<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.790> lot<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.239> hair<00:03:58.420> because<00:03:58.840> i

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
i'm not using a lot of hair because i

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.490 
i'm not using a lot of hair because i
kind<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.170> want<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.770> be<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.110> messy

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
kind of want it to be more like a messy

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.410 
kind of want it to be more like a messy

wave it doesn't it doesn't have to be

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.360 
wave it doesn't it doesn't have to be
like<00:04:04.660> one<00:04:05.050> hundred<00:04:05.260> percent<00:04:05.290> perfect

this<00:04:19.919> much<00:04:20.220> better<00:04:26.780> my<00:04:27.780> bangs<00:04:27.990> I'm<00:04:28.199> going<00:04:28.320> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
this much better my bangs I'm going to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.200 
this much better my bangs I'm going to
go<00:04:28.500> ahead<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.710> curl<00:04:29.100> them<00:04:29.370> inwards<00:04:30.090> whoopsie

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
go ahead and curl them inwards whoopsie

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.780 
go ahead and curl them inwards whoopsie
think<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.419> this<00:04:33.570> wave<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.320> can<00:04:34.590> look<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.160> look

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
think for this wave you can look I look

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.550 
think for this wave you can look I look
better<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.690> rolling<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:39.560> don't

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
better like it's rolling out so don't

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.050 
better like it's rolling out so don't
leave<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:40.919> on<00:04:41.010> my<00:04:41.070> bangs<00:04:41.430> too<00:04:41.669> long<00:04:41.850> because

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
leave it on my bangs too long because
