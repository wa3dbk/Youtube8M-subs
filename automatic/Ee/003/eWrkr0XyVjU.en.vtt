00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
depth of field if you can get up to f56

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
depth of field if you can get up to f56
f8<00:00:14.360> something<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.750> you're<00:00:15.990> gonna<00:00:16.109> get

might even be tempted to go to a
thousand<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.730> twelve<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.550> morning<00:00:32.969> our

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
thousand or twelve so this morning our

thousand or twelve so this morning our
wake<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.420> call<00:00:33.690> was<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.670> 5:15<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> morning

wake up call was at 5:15 in the morning

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.610 
wake up call was at 5:15 in the morning
we<00:00:37.170> literally<00:00:37.829> landed<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.870> Espanola<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
we literally landed on Espanola as the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
we literally landed on Espanola as the
Sun<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.010> rising<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> biggest

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Sun was rising so one of the biggest

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.430 
Sun was rising so one of the biggest
differences<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> photographic

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
differences in the photographic

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
differences in the photographic
expeditions<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.190> my<00:00:44.340> mind<00:00:44.610> whether<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
expeditions in my mind whether you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
expeditions in my mind whether you
choose<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> carry<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.719> camera<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
choose to carry a camera or not is that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
choose to carry a camera or not is that
we<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.760> try<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.719> advantage<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
we really try to take advantage of the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.580

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
animals have no fear of humans we are

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
animals have no fear of humans we are
able<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.430> imagery<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:00.270> animals<00:01:00.719> here

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
able to get imagery from animals here

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.490 
able to get imagery from animals here
that<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.550> shy<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.780> way<00:01:03.989> shape

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that are just not shy in any way shape

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
that are just not shy in any way shape
or<00:01:04.710> form<00:01:04.769> they're<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.400> concerned<00:01:05.880> about<00:01:06.060> us

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
or form they're not concerned about us

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
or form they're not concerned about us
they're<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.020> fleeing<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.710> us<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they're not fleeing from us so with a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.510 
they're not fleeing from us so with a
careful<00:01:09.299> slow<00:01:09.630> approach<00:01:10.040> even<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> smallest

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
careful slow approach even the smallest

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
careful slow approach even the smallest
camera<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.270> create<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> most<00:01:12.960> incredible

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
camera can create the most incredible

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
camera can create the most incredible
imagery<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.610> wildlife<00:01:15.090> surrounds

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
imagery because the wildlife surrounds

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
imagery because the wildlife surrounds
us<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> places<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
us here so of all the places in the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
us here so of all the places in the
world<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> photograph<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.650> ghost

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
world to photograph like a lot of ghost

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
world to photograph like a lot of ghost
ranks<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> highest<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.840> because

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
ranks is one of the highest just because

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
ranks is one of the highest just because
you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.380> truly<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:23.040> those<00:01:23.250> intimate

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you can truly get those intimate

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
you can truly get those intimate
portraits<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.330> animals<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.170> their<00:01:25.590> native

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
portraits of animals in their native

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
portraits of animals in their native
place<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.710> yeah<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.950> went<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.610> plus<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
place so yeah we went to a plus and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
place so yeah we went to a plus and
what's<00:01:31.290> happening<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.250> shutter

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
what's happening is that my shutter

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.300 
what's happening is that my shutter
speed<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.000> getting<00:01:33.119> slower<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.860> staying

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
speed is getting slower so it's staying

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
speed is getting slower so it's staying
open<00:01:35.790> less<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.650> time

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
open less time it's a lot or more time

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
open less time it's a lot or more time
excuse<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.460> allowing<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.119> light<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
excuse me it's allowing more light to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
excuse me it's allowing more light to
come<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.950> that's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> denominator<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:42.030> so

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
come in that's the denominator right so

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
come in that's the denominator right so
as<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.079> keep<00:01:43.290> going<00:01:43.350> 250th<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> second<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
as I keep going 250th of a second is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.020 
as I keep going 250th of a second is
slower<00:01:45.630> than<00:01:46.110> three<00:01:46.860> twentieth<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
slower than three twentieth so the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
slower than three twentieth so the
little<00:01:48.390> shutter<00:01:48.630> staying<00:01:48.990> open<00:01:49.229> longer<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
little shutter staying open longer and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.340 
little shutter staying open longer and
by<00:01:50.220> staying<00:01:50.579> open<00:01:51.090> longer<00:01:51.329> I'm<00:01:51.840> letting<00:01:52.229> more

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
by staying open longer I'm letting more

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.999 
by staying open longer I'm letting more
light<00:01:52.680> into<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.490> camera<00:01:56.570> exactly<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
light into the camera exactly so we have

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.100 
light into the camera exactly so we have
for<00:01:59.340> photographic<00:02:00.060> staff<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.810> this
