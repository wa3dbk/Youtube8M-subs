00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.680
 but it is on 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.539
 99 halo is just tuesday 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.000
 we just went there now everything went 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.920
 have seen 1 0 won 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.120
 the sensational we are from the apple 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.460
 store in hamburg Tuesday 56, 18 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.380
 start of the iphone 5 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 and we have the first people in 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.630
 hit germany times 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.630
 in front of us at all 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.790
 why are you stupid and fighting 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.559
 already from the apple store the iphone 5 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 against 4 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.460
 quite a update and I just want 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.460
 the first who 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.269
 but why exactly is iphone 5 so 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.230
 blatant update towards iphone 4 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.339
 I did not understand it 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.390
 so once said the wusterwitzer 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.110
 Of course the back appeal to those 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.860
 has changed 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:15.440
 the old iphone but easy to have 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:21.440
 the new features exactly what 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:25.250
 Exactly that's ok about that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.250
 ios update or ios iphone 4 as well 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 first iphone 5 pleases is the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.440
 Improving the camera's 8 megapixels 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.909
 camera and it can also get better 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 and twice as fast processor 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.280
 It will probably be enough to know well enough 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.929
 exactly the same again for me is mine a couple 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.140
 months cloud was worked out as even 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:51.189
 No one currently on the iPhone 5 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:57.689
 to get webster you 're too 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:02:01.359
 independently what exactly are you doing that 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:06.570
 you want cool and the bottle with you 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:09.520
 I can cook for a relatively young man 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.380
 drinking water more posters by giving that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.630
 money must understand what would go out 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.530
 and that is why the good is because of this 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.330
 plastic mountain driving can then be spared 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.560
 which next to me as a user, so to speak 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.630
 I was our babbel hair 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.680
 had later 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.690
 on the way we have to work on it 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.760
 must have the marks ball 50 filtered 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.480
 water is not enough money 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.480
 ratified 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.420
 so you can buy it 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.420
 you can do that too, Roger Bommel 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.420
 written together 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 Thank you very much
