 let's prepare a yogurt cake and 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 coconut we need four eggs an envelope 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.849
 of yeast chemical flour oil

 olive konko grated sugar and a gallon and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.869
 that can be natural or coconut flavor 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.259
 we have put the four whole eggs 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 in a container and now we're going to 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.910
 add the yogurt 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.980
 the envelope of yeast 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 and with the yogurt cup that is going to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.600
 serve as a measure we will also add 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.610
 three short flour yogurt and three 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.150
 little cups of sugar 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.860
 and half a glass of yogurt oil 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.769
 olive all that we are going to add to this 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.689
 container 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:14.070
 and finally we will add coconut we will beat 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.079
 everything very well and with this has ended in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.450
 the elaboration consists of mixing 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.280
 simply the ingredients and beat them 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 very well but you know the measure is the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.479
 of the yogurt cup 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.110
 recapitulating we have added the 4 eggs 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.009
 the envelope of yeast a yogurt in this 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 case of coconut 3 cups of flour 3 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:47.700
 sugar cups and now we are missing 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.700
 add a half glass of olive oil 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 all the cups with Christmas 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.650
 I will now receive this very well 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.140
 very well very well and when this shake 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.260
 we will add grated coconut because the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.820
 amount that we want already you will see what 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.450
 that I add 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.400
 and we will beat again and it will be so 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 now we take the blender and mix 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.150
 this very well 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 Hello 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.190
 we have already mixed all the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.550
 ingredients and now finally we're going to 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.550
 Add 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.570
 this amount of grated coconut is at 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.150
 taste and there is no exact measure then 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.340
 about a small full glass 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.950
 of coconut or a little more but that's it is 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.220
 random now we add it to the mix 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.800
 we beat a little bit and we already have it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.740
 once all the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.600
 mix we are going to pour it into a mold that 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.230
 we have put with the non-stick 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.280
 and we'll put it in the oven that we have it 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.280
 preheated to 200 degrees 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.810
 now let's introduce the sponge cake or 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.329
 the container that is going to be for the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.629
 cake in the second height starting 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.170
 down in the oven and lower the 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:26.739
 temperature to 180 degrees we will have it 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.319
 about 35 minutes to check that this 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.019
 done we will puncture when it comes out 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.829
 with a toothpick in the center of the cake 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.180
 and if it comes out dry it is that it is already 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:42.730
 You can open the oven door during 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.460
 the elaboration since otherwise it would not rise 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.980
 the cake 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.310
 we just took the cake out of the oven 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.700
 we had it 40 minutes because when 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.400
 had passed 35 I've punctured him in the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.890
 center with a toothpick and it gave me the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.990
 impression that I was a little bit still 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.319
 like a leaf disc by the center 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.909
 Then I had 40 minutes 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.219
 now we have to wait for it to 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.340
 cool or at least temper 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:15.299
 enough to unmold since if 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.299
 it would not break us 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.230
 we have already undressed the cake and here 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.710
 you have the result 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.450
 It is a cake to make easy and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.320
 you see that it only consists in beating the 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.370
 ingredients 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.639
 and the same as we have put coconut also 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.190
 It can be made with lemon with orange 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.300
 but this one 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.300
 the result
