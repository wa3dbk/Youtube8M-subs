00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 And what I'll teach you to do 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.069
 jailbreak for ios 7 in any 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.069
 device so I started 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.820
 Well first of all they have to 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.580
 know two things the first is that they have 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.590
 to restore factory idea on iTunes 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.500
 Your ipod touch iphone or ipad darla 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.090
 they want to restore like that normal and once 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.579
 have done that because it will be 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.290
 ready your air for snow and the second 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.180
 thing have to go here adjustments then 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.000
 you have to go to general then we 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.340
 we go below in automatic blocking and 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.989
 we are going to put him never never that never 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.489
 it is automatically blocked so that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.350
 well, it will not be blocked during the 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.610
 jailbreak this is only for the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.130
 jailbreak if they want to remove it after 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 OK 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.290
 and good now if we leave the ipad what 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 we connect to itunes and we will go to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.800
 the new veis john page of butters 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.740
 that I leave in the description we are going 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 to download the file for either mac or 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.940
 windows no matter what we download is going to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.860
 take a little bit but here you 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 advance so that it does not take so long and 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.390
 that has just been downloaded is going to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.160
 download a zip file and rar no 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 matter the point is with needing if 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.500
 save to unpack it and good 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.150
 everyone has it then just what 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 we open and I have it here in the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.300
 desktop and we will extract the program 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.369
 nothing else the program we do not drag it to 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.229
 desktop and here we already have 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.050
 we right click and execute as 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.119
 administrator if they are on mac then you 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.400
 right click and open this is not for 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 that do not give any problem and here we see 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.910
 that we have already connected our ipod 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 fifth generation touch we have it 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.640
 unlocked on and we give it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 jailbreak we do not touch the device unless 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 that the program tells us and well I 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.369
 here I will advance the processes for 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.750
 that it does not take so long in fact the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.810
 hard process 1 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.400
 ten minutes in total but then I would 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 I make a short so as not to make too long 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.840
 video then that will tell us 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.150
 configuren system and the first thing that goes to 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 happen is that it's going to change to the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.790
 second screen of the ipad and this is going 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 to add the evasion icon sÃ©verni ok 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.429
 here they do not touch it they do not touch the ipad not what 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 they block nothing they just leave it there and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.110
 they wait for new instructions not then 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.959
 here will change to get it there 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 number two absolutely nothing happens and 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.620
 then milestone of that is going to restart 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.370
 for the first time our ipod touch 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.320
 iphone or ipad in 97 then we will 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
 appear the logo the icon of this 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.120
 tour that is restarting and then 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.030
 will ask us to unlock our 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.630
 device and give you click the button 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.820
 from good to the button to the evasion icon is 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.540
 come then we do exactly that and 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.970
 nothing else 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 unlock and click the icon what 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.620
 we leave there again without touching 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.380
 absolutely nothing and good is going to 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.660
 restart the device a second time 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 and it will not appear the same and with it 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.300
 or it will take 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.010
 and well, this depends on what 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.900
 device that they have so much to 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.090
 late and then he will ask us again 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.520
 unlock the device this time 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.920
 just unlock it do not do nothing 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.040
 more and there in the program is going to tell us 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.100
 modify groups then it will change to another 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.980
 thing 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.230
 and we just hope we leave it there and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.940
 is going to tell us where this means that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.790
 here we can close the program 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.740
 we can naughty and in exit and now everything 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.930
 everything else is going to happen on the ipod touch and it 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.970
 is going to finish rebooting and it's going to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.840
 leave here the butters icon and then 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.770
 will come out 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.890
 as it says and reading carnal then calculates 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.410
 green offsets will change to this heap 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.830
 of things and then that's going to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.510
 restart a third time and since it 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.730
 have restarted they simply turn it on 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.310
 they unblock it and if from there it will be 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.590
 there then we simply open ideas and 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.140
 it's going to load it's going to restart the ipod 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.270

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.350
