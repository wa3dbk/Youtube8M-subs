the<00:00:28.260> idea<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.220> close<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the idea is that you get close to the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
the idea is that you get close to the
ledges<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.480> down<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.080> click<00:00:32.009> your

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
ledges as you go down and you click your

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
ledges as you go down and you click your
right<00:00:32.340> trigger<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.940> grips<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.570> onto<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
right trigger and it grips you onto the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.959 
right trigger and it grips you onto the
ledge<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.980> climb<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
ledge and then you just climb up and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.569 
ledge and then you just climb up and
then<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.190> splat

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
then go in and and on or you could splat

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.520 
then go in and and on or you could splat
straight<00:00:39.300> onto<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> ledge<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.140> walk<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
straight onto the ledge and then walk in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.979 
straight onto the ledge and then walk in
