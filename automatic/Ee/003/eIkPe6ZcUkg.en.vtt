obviously the way this looks on skreets
tying<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> whole<00:01:38.610> Microsoft<00:01:39.210> image<00:01:39.689> of

tying in with a whole Microsoft image of
the<00:01:39.990> tiles<00:01:40.500> everything<00:01:40.799> else<00:01:40.920> yeah<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.340> does

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the tiles everything else yeah and does

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
the tiles everything else yeah and does
that<00:01:41.850> uniformity<00:01:42.479> add<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.930> anything<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that uniformity add to anything well I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
that uniformity add to anything well I
suppose<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> does<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> same

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
suppose it does you know it's the same

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
suppose it does you know it's the same
that<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:45.990> tablet<00:01:46.439> saying<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that you get on your tablet saying that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.289 
that you get on your tablet saying that
your<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.100> PC<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.119> they've

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
your get on your PC that they've

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
your get on your PC that they've
simplified<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> dashboard<00:01:49.500> incredibly<00:01:50.100> now

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
simplified the dashboard incredibly now

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.649 
simplified the dashboard incredibly now
is<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.090> almost<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.390> three

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is I think it's almost like three

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.789 
is I think it's almost like three
screens<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> out<00:01:52.680> your

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
screens and you have kind of out your

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.350 
screens and you have kind of out your
pins<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.340> side<00:01:53.549> rather<00:01:53.790> than<00:01:53.909> before<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pins on one side rather than before it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.550 
pins on one side rather than before it
was<00:01:54.450> quite<00:01:54.720> there's<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.229> awful<00:01:55.439> lot<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
was quite there's an awful lot of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
was quite there's an awful lot of
information<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> biggest

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
information I think one of the biggest

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
information I think one of the biggest
problems<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.719> there's<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.770> much

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
problems is there's gonna be so much

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
problems is there's gonna be so much
content<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.790> all<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.299> machines<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
content on all of these machines it's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.469 
content on all of these machines it's
finding<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.790> packaging<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
finding a way of you know packaging it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
finding a way of you know packaging it
up<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.930> isn't<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.799> too

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
up in a way that isn't like too

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709 
up in a way that isn't like too
