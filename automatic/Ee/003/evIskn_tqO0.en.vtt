00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.680
 from the place always plays as 100 only 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.370
 cook in the water with them but you 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.930
 You can also deserts in your own juice 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.800
 this always a little bit 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.429
 fat rub with the towel from a go 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:25.880
 couple of onions with purely let the glass 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:28.810
 I'll tackle that, then they 'll give it 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 spinach with it 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.290
 spinach bushel water you will see 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.090
 like the spinach in no time 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:48.590
 Water loses that we give a whole 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:51.170
 little bit of vegetable stock and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.350
 steam the covered in its own juice 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.050
 with that within one to two 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.030
 minutes of stewing is done 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 Advantage that all the nutrients too 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.370
 stay with 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.260
 we really have it in our own juice 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.180
 we did not have much 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.950
 It is very much lost vitamins 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710
 Gentle ones do what you do 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.840
 really ideal of vegetables 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.740
 but also some poultry or fish 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:22.869
 species is also wanted a camera 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:25.759
 In question we want to fry now 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.770
 because I recommend him first the pan 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.970
 to make hot before adding the oil 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.860
 as ins burns in her oil too fast 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.660
 the fed saving here is that they theirs 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.240
 banner with either the brush easily from 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.810
 rub or over a cloth a bit 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.590
 take oil with it and take her 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.479
 easily advertise pan must 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.039
 wait until the pan is hot 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.130
 is 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.810
 the following happens fry them 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.369
 close the pores of the meat there can 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 the meat juice will not get out then 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.240
 as well as do not see 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 additional standing while searing breasts 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.049
 and tastes very much 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.390
 they are important for the meat then 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.280
 also a corresponding 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 Taste experience you have recognized 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 when roasting can be very fast 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.560
 what quality in meat 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 Inferior meat loses relatively 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.000
 lots of juice and a lot of water 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.400
 at a high-quality meat nice 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.790
 Mature everything stays in the meat 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.840
 included 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
 you take a palette or and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 headbands in addition 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.100
 beautiful meat slices the little one 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.740
 key here within a to 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.420
 two minutes in the pan finished when 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.670
 we have a very large piece in many 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.680
 also offers the breakdown completely 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.150
 in the top to put there three to four 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.100
 minutes to rebuild 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.900
 or he was the heat too 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.850
 reduce your meat from the outside 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.440
 not to brew word too many raw materials 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 there and inside the meat still where 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.400
 Soja is knocked thin the schnitzel is 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.770
 already done with her 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.990
 Legal side dish will be served 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.060
 many will take a two minutes in 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.160
 many may cannes you in me where I too 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.270
 would still be a bit pink 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.040
 of course in his household one 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.230
 coated pan has the take with it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.330
 It 's just as valuable to the shape as it is 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.239
 even a little less fat has exactly 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.660
 the same good advice we result 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.510
 now damp salmon trout to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.739
 takes a few laws are laurel leaf 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.270
 make juniper clove and peppercorns 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.570
 the below we have water below 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.330
 we have white wine in it 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.100
 we have many salmon trout that 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.549
 is we are very quickly from both 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.370
 sides of pepper and salt from sultry 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.310
 at heart we BE REDUCED now our movie on 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:59.660
 The company has a few herbs with it 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:01.850
 on it snappy knop still so that we leave 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.980
 Cover it with steam 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.660
 the difference to the stink is that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.940
 I have the gargut now over steam 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.130
 not in your own juice as in the stew 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.200
 that's why you should try it all 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.239
 a little to flavor because of that 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.560
 the white wines in there where spices too 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.459
 with this purely that the herbal one 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.650
 just a little taste 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.049
 we would like to transport at fischer 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.340
 if possible, do not go completely through the fish 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.440
 he should be able to do that a bit 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.240
 be glassy with it and it leaves you now 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.479
 in this damper about three to four 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.820
 Mitten in the steam minutes and then is 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.530
 there are many we have already finished 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.530
 our meat looks like it's the name 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.200
 says in the southwest when he's short and 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.690
 At the cook point , it is so 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.430
 until then afterwards with the sample of 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.020
 the fork until tomorrow it 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.020
 between we can take
