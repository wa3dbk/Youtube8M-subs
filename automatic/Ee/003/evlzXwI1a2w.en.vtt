00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960
 Another offers from me today 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 another course goes on the canal there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.220
 in the network servers and me is something fine 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.840
 that is somehow noticed 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 now at qs the better done though 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 comes quickly rein in the round must 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 you just say well then yes then 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.079
 We can at least be short for us 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.670
 Equip yes I have it mine 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 sword in the skin was not with me 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 because without joke people, you go that way 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 I can not leave quickly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.030
 take a slow approach here and that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 I have to say that positively 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 honestly say i already found it 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.460
 sometimes really blatantly long as you are there 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.260
 always had to wait until you get in here 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 the round came and then after ten 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 in seconds the man splashed 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.869
 Kraft means yes because you know yes I have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.049

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.270
 Praise the other people and there 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.270
 he has his head turned by 180 degrees 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.480
 ok so I just now the subject 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.370
 brought minecraft live like it is 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.070
 many youtuber just have the theme 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.900
 simply because I have the project 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.350
 really hard celebration so I think it's 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.820
 simply it 's really nice he had 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.960
 well done you well done but unfortunately 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.580
 did not work out and I think so 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.650
 whole project right into ice must 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.140
 is just so say yes I celebrate 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.520
 Just look at the love and it does 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.630
 I just really much fun alone 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.670
 I usually look where I am 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 really no person not her he thinks 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.880
 maybe always through the minecraft 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 news he looks anyway everything I do 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.220
 I'm not a person who likes it now 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.479
 So fifteen minutes of videos like pulling 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.460
 I'm not so good myself 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.900
 or I just do not do it with me 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.280
 always a bit i hope that can 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.190
 you tolerate 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.350
 Oh, so I thought behind us if we did 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.970
 up there, yes, how brazen is that yes 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.340
 He then makes a real sniper 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.200
 do not know the st we go on 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.490
 Best on none or the one above 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.690
 I do not like that then ok then 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.250
 Let him leave me alone in the peace 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.209
 the top pick the one that suits me 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.590
 not in the junk 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.090
 I do not know what I'm doing now I 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.100
 could be really bold now yes the whole 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.630
 shoot but I honestly come 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.730
 Come on, I'm coming up too 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.140
 real niki computer up again and 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.050
 somehow style has been on twitter 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.590
 some of you also have such a hashtag 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.570
 yes you had such a hashtag where he 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.459
 just said so splash in 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.500
 live minecraft and so what too 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.209
 somehow really cool 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.970
 of you is that she thinks too yes 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.320
 We do like the spam bit now 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.769
 but rum make as make the hashtag 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.120
 think how people did people 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.739
 to invite in ermsleben 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 So we do a little bit on the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.910
 splash alert and that's exactly what it has 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.160
 then the simon in his video 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.650
 addressed that it just does not work 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.790
 live at minecraft but that she has 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.130
 just send the other something up 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.019
 easy on was clear but still 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.549
 somehow every case cool of mine 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.530
 form of you that you just stop there 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.700
 have tried a bit on twitter ball 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.380
 not right 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.910
 there is definitely always going on 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.930
 Anyway what it means to follow me 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 can will gladly do 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.110
 yes so he said simon has explained in 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.780
 his video that's not so natural 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.220
 I was also clear from the start 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.570
 I do not have it for him now 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.130
 said yes do that times two 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.130
 practically by where is it 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.299
 Probably okay over there 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.099
 because there was definitely luck 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.870
 the statement of the match started here 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.159
 because he has really tricked because I 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.450
 think that would have fallen down 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.220
 sorry that i like the construction site now 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.599
 said a really hundredth recording 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.379
 right now I think so one or one 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.379
 it has to do it 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.409
 Here I come with it now too 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.799
 now really tight here, too, no more lust 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.310
 had 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.200
 on something so sorry gg so and there I want 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.930
 say people if you liked it 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.090
 thanks to load in any case a positive 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.500
 grading the end does not sound that way 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.819
 Glorious, it really does 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.079
 I hope you can forgive me 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.370
 that was my point of view 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.989
 I thought it was cool of you that you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.250
 But you have to learn to do that 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.810
 the project follows on twitter 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.810
