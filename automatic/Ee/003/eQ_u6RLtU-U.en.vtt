 Hello dear friends with you mr 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.750
 and I finally arrived a year and in this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 video we will do with you gouache 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 Why is it you can buy but for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 spring 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 and I will answer you in my cat draw 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 more convenient than watercolor and not always 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.039
 there is a gouache at hand and so we 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 we can do it ourselves 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 well then let's get this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.920
 will need a chalk hammer any or pants 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 and heavy to scientific glass 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 any wand or i will 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 using a brush that stir it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.770
 all that well 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.100
 watercolor let's get started first 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.670
 I need to take a bold vegetable 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 well let's go 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 why chalk 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.250
 we will need to grind it into small ones 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.560
 fine powder 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.270
 next we need to take a brush 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.880
 our and pinch off a piece of watercolor i 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.640
 I will feel the red watercolor 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.390
 Well, since it is not red 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.030
 to be determined 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.030
 you can report another piece 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:51.670
 we throw his glass the more so 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:56.660
 the better the light will be richer 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.110
 so as much as possible we will try 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.110
 opinion 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 feet she skulls 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.680
 now we will need to pour into 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.220
 a cup of hot water 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.310
 the base is ready now the last thing for us 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.560

 added a little red paint and mine 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.690
 It turned out such a base color I do not like to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.560
 for thinking but in general, that's not the point I 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.870
 added more chalk because paint has 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.480
