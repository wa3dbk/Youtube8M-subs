 archive 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:34.239
 this is an installer has a weight of 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.730
 29 mb ok since it brings accessories 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.890
 some other things more and that's why 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.050
 Perez a little more ok 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.880
 good once you have downloaded 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.110

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.420
 Well, he asks for their permission, they say yes 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.420
 and well let's lower the volume 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 very well as many know and this one is 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.880
 same installers good let's put 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.220

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.220
 and we wait for the splash to pass 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.050
 this is the installer can remove that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 in all the music and good good here 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.380

 customized we will give accepted the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.130
 agreement I will give you following next 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 we install 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.480
 and that would be all and good at the end 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.360
 automatically we will install the 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 good topic to apply rather well said 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.480
 here we have the theme there is 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.700
 and well this is how we are seen when 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.520
 customization the control panel is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.030
 see in this way system and security are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.140
 well and good views the system itself and looks 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.140
 in this way 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.690

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.580
 next would this be the next one is 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.860
 this and the next one would be this very well 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.050
 let's also remove the installer 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 from here and this is our bar 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.209

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.770
 that I have in the context menu the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.980
 installer leaves you this folder though 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.069

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.690
 files that is the line of the clock the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.190
 org and some sources for their subject the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.650
 sources are going to click on someone 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.420
 well let's go in there let's talk 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.830
 well we are going to select all the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.070
 let's right click and install 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.420
 ok to me tells me that already exist because 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 they had installed them I'm going to put 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.310
 here and I'll say yes 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.860
 and this already we have installed all the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.780
 sources 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.880
 with this our theme is going to have this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 type of letters and all the letters like 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.330
 these here that are different from the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.530
 that brings windows very well and in good 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.489
 we are also going to use what is the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.319
 forgiveness watch first work as nador 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.630
 we are seeing has the one that comes by 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.900
 defect in windows and what we're going to 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.900
 do explained right about the menu of 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.650
 Home properties gives you our 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.540
 appearance we are going to add we are going and 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.079
 we look for that it would be in desk 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.260
 in the org plugin and we select 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.880
 we also be selected can we 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.850
 to apply and we will give you ok 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.200
 and now we have there as we are seeing 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.470
 we have already expanded this area here 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.290
 now here we are seeing that you see this 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.120
 white line building the line 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.180
 white what we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.630
 remove it as you are going to remove this with the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.970
 line blas ok ok we double click 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.790
 and with that we have removed that line 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.430
 white in that part of there and our 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.680
 taskbar has now become 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.400
 completely transparent very well in 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.590
 these areas where there is nothing 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.160
 clock time the clock that is like this 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.620
 that I have right now here 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.420
 very well and here it is in the folder where 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.670
 it has clocked very well there are two options 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.530
 here this is trial and error since 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.970
 you have to try a file first 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.440
 then with the other 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.530
 if it works for you the first one is not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.060
 necessary to use the second file 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.030
 very well what you have to do is 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.230
 be good to drag the one that says 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.490
 replace tim from your desktop 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.050
 equally one of the two files the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.320
 which says 8 the one that says 8.1 in this good 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.260
 this time I have no 28.1 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.360
 now let's give right click change 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.360
 name and we will put m 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.389
 although in lower case we give you intro 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.750
 and we'll have it here, let's give 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.360
 double click to rules art king day we 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.300
 ask for permission same yes and we get 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.270
 this option now 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.879
 what we are going to do is give him an enter 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.389
 let's wait for it to end and at the end 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:46.240
 let's have the clock so clearly to 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.520
 you can only get one 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.000
 I watch that I have two clocks activated 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.310
 more or that we will come out clearly 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.300
 and so you have activated two others 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.360
 they will leave more watches very well and 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.460
 well they would wait and that would be all very 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.979
 well I close this because I do not need 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.039
 Now it's good to replace my team 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.020
 law since I already have it installed very 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.409
 well the last one can return these two 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.669
 files to the watch folder 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.319
 very well that would be all for that folder 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.949
 and well this is the subject I show you 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:27.159
 well in a start menu start a 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:31.449
 extended search very well there is 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:35.529
 search very well folders folders 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:38.829
