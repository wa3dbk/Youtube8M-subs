00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.410

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 corrector with a small brush on the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.800
 part of top I'm going to delineate me with 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.870

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.700
 brush this will make it look more marked 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.190
 the eyebrow always remember to start with the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.470
 means to mark the arch and with what 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.060
 you over color at the beginning of the eyebrows 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.060
 so that it does not look so marked 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.340
 you can apply the false signs if 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.340
