difference<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.460> shape<00:01:44.729> design<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.960> really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
difference in shape design it's really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
difference in shape design it's really
not<00:01:46.320> too<00:01:46.619> significantly<00:01:47.250> different<00:01:47.610> in

not too significantly different in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
not too significantly different in
physical<00:01:48.119> aspects<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> shape<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> guys

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
