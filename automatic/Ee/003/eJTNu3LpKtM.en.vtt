00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.330
 do not 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.550
 hello how welcome to the channel is 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.800
 news today is that 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.779
 Russian scientists have discovered blood 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.610
 and muscle tissues perfectly fine 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.230
 conserved among the remains of a mammoth 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.060
 wooly buried under the ice in the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.190
 small island reads jobs quin on the coast 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.230
 from northeastern Russia the find supposes 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.970
 an important step in the realization of 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 an unprecedented experiment the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.270
 cloning and the return to life of this 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.890
 species that disappeared from the face of the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.199
 earth about 10,000 years ago 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.610
 the expedition carried out at 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.350
 beginning of the month for society 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.330
 Russian geographic and specialists of the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.339
 Northeastern Federal University Yakutia 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.229
 eastern siberia could recover and 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.629
 examine the body of the animal a female 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.120
 of about 60 years located the past 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.979
 August the mammoth died between 10,000 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 and 15,000 years but his remains have 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.519
 challenged the passage of time in a way 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 extraordinary to the point that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.420
 keeps blood in a liquid state when 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
 we broke the ice under his abdomen flowed 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.870
 Very dark blood is the most 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.150
 amazing that I've seen in my life 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.990
 says sendón grigóriev responsible for the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.360
 scientific team 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.210
 in addition the muscle tissues were 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.290
 red of the color of fresh meat 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.940
 Grigoriev believes that the miracle of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.330
 blood could be produced because the mammoth 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.830
 it fell 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420
 well of water or in a swamp 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.980
 probably up to half of its 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.930
 body in the lower part was 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850
 frozen in the water the superior 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.320
 including the spine and the head 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.570
 have the signs of the attack of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.460
 predators the front legs and the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.590
 stomachs are well preserved but the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.300
 back is a skeleton the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 researcher believes that the finding can 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.990
 suppose one more step in the attempt to 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.250
 cloning this extinct animal gives us 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.350
 real chances of finding 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 living cells the mammoths found with 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.850
 beforehand they did not have tissues too 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.020
 preserved point the Russian university 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.580
 has reached an agreement with the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.350
 South Korean scientist hwang woo suk 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.030
 father of the first dog cloned and 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.410
 sadly famous for cheating the world 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.150
 with the first cell cloning 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.640
 human beings to carry out the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.960
 exploration of resurrecting a mammoth the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.760
 researchers have already achieved 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.260
 enviable of the tissue of another mammoth 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.940
 frozen in siberia 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.740
 The idea is to extract nuclei from several 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.480
 giant cells and insert them into 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.790
 elephant ovules to create an embryo 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.560
 that contains your genes that embryo is 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.540
 implant in the uterus of an elephant and 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.990
 if it goes well, the first mammoth will be born 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.990
 modern 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.770
 a greeting 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.060
 see you here in the channel is now 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.060
 with more news
