you have any recommendations so my

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.799 
you have any recommendations so my
recommendation<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.789> the<00:00:33.059> scale<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.510> use

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
recommendation is the scale that I use

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.360 
recommendation is the scale that I use
at<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.110> house<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.740> know<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.190> works

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
at my house because I know how it works

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
at my house because I know how it works
and<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> trust<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.240> so<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.900> scale<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.320> use

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and I trust it so the scale that I use

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
and I trust it so the scale that I use
is<00:00:37.770> called<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> eat<00:00:38.310> smart<00:00:38.640> nutrition<00:00:39.240> scale

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
is called the eat smart nutrition scale

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
is called the eat smart nutrition scale
and<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> looks<00:00:40.560> like<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:41.340> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and this is what it looks like if you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
and this is what it looks like if you
follow<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.660> blog<00:00:42.900> Sarah<00:00:43.350> fit<00:00:43.620> comm<00:00:44.100> you've

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
seen it in various pictures and it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
seen it in various pictures and it's
actually<00:00:46.710> even<00:00:46.890> been<00:00:47.040> featured<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.730> diatom

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
actually even been featured in a diatom

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.690 
actually even been featured in a diatom
video<00:00:48.540> or<00:00:48.750> two<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.380> so<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.489> like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
video or two and so what I really like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.280 
video or two and so what I really like
about<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:51.120> scale<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.350> each<00:00:53.190> food

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
about my scale is that each food

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.229 
about my scale is that each food
corresponds<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.620> number<00:00:56.220> code<00:00:56.790> that<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
corresponds to a number code that is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
corresponds to a number code that is
right<00:00:57.450> here<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> instruction<00:00:58.470> manual<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
right here in the instruction manual and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
right here in the instruction manual and
so<00:00:59.970> if<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.540> apple<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.200> know<00:01:01.440> apples

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so if I have an apple you know apples

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
so if I have an apple you know apples
come<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> different<00:01:02.670> sizes<00:01:02.880> you<00:01:03.660> put

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
come in a lot of different sizes you put

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
come in a lot of different sizes you put
it<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.519> plug<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.969> in<00:01:06.149> what<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it on here you plug it in what the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.030 
it on here you plug it in what the
number<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.870> and<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> wanted<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> could

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
number is and if you wanted you could

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
number is and if you wanted you could
put<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> plate<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> subtract<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
put it on a plate and subtract with the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.350 
put it on a plate and subtract with the
plate<00:01:09.810> ways<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.130> submit<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.120> code

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
plate ways and then you submit the code

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
plate ways and then you submit the code
and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.049> tells<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> how<00:01:13.590> many<00:01:13.650> calories

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and then it tells you how many calories

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
and then it tells you how many calories
how<00:01:14.460> many<00:01:14.640> carbs<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.360> many<00:01:15.540> fat<00:01:15.780> protein

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
how many carbs how many fat protein

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
how many carbs how many fat protein
whatever<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> food<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.600> top<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
whatever is in the food that's on top of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
whatever is in the food that's on top of
the<00:01:19.080> scale<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> super<00:01:20.790> important<00:01:21.299> if

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the scale this is super important if

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
the scale this is super important if
you're<00:01:21.570> trying<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> lose<00:01:22.260> weight<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
times it's hard to keep track of how

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
times it's hard to keep track of how
many<00:01:25.110> calories<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.950> eating<00:01:26.330> even<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> have

I will measure out my food more often I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
I will measure out my food more often I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960 
also use this in recipes to go by weight
rather<00:01:36.420> than<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:37.439> much<00:01:37.560> people<00:01:37.890> say<00:01:38.159> using<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
rather than how much people say using a

rather than how much people say using a
measuring<00:01:39.360> cup<00:01:39.510> with<00:01:40.020> things<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.380> peanut

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
measuring cup with things like peanut

butter peanut butter is a really good
thing<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.860> use<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.369> measuring<00:01:44.880> scale<00:01:45.270> for

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
thing to use this measuring scale for

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350 
thing to use this measuring scale for
just<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.830> you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.939> hard<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.210> know

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
