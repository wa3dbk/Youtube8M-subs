00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
y'all know what I have my deep

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.340 
y'all know what I have my deep
conditioners<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.670> don't<00:02:53.880> look<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.780> super

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
conditioners I don't look for like super

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.050 
conditioners I don't look for like super
slip<00:02:55.620> or<00:02:55.830> anything<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.940> expect<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
slip or anything but I expect a

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.820 
slip or anything but I expect a
conditioner<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.690> have<00:03:00.840> some<00:03:01.140> type<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> slip

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
conditioner to have some type of slip

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.500 
conditioner to have some type of slip
because<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.670> conditioner<00:03:03.660> right<00:03:04.320> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
different type of proteins in it okay so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.640 
different type of proteins in it okay so
if<00:03:44.640> you're<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> borderline<00:03:45.540> protein<00:03:46.170> sensitive

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
if you're a borderline protein sensitive

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.050 
if you're a borderline protein sensitive
like<00:03:46.890> me<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:48.420> was<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.720> issue<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.200> me<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.590> has

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
awesome or anything but it wasn't like

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.560 
awesome or anything but it wasn't like
super<00:04:15.390> horrible<00:04:15.630> BET<00:04:16.230> right<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.340> then<00:04:18.210> um

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
super horrible BET right and then um

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.710 
super horrible BET right and then um
when<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.500> use<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.070> deep<00:04:20.720> conditioner

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
when I use it for a deep conditioner

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.620 
when I use it for a deep conditioner
when<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.140> had<00:04:22.320> on<00:04:22.440> my<00:04:22.470> hair<00:04:22.710> for<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.920> little<00:04:23.040> bit<00:04:23.220> I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
when I had on my hair for a little bit I

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.230 
when I had on my hair for a little bit I
could<00:04:24.630> that's<00:04:25.140> what<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.380> felt<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:26.010> okay<00:04:26.460> yeah

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
could that's what I felt like okay yeah

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.850 
could that's what I felt like okay yeah
this<00:04:27.479> has<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.690> lot<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.050> protein

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
this has a lot of protein

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.610 
this has a lot of protein
my<00:04:28.979> hair<00:04:29.219> isn't<00:04:29.490> reacting<00:04:30.000> right<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.629> it<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.110> if

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
my hair isn't reacting right to it so if

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.189 
my hair isn't reacting right to it so if
your<00:04:31.800> hair<00:04:31.949> really<00:04:32.310> likes<00:04:32.669> protein<00:04:33.300> then<00:04:33.810> you

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
your hair really likes protein then you

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.200 
your hair really likes protein then you
know<00:04:34.319> you'd<00:04:34.590> probably<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:35.039> really<00:04:36.000> good<00:04:36.180> with

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
know you'd probably be really good with

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.260 
know you'd probably be really good with

this but my hair is kind of finicky when

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.300 
this but my hair is kind of finicky when
it<00:04:39.360> comes<00:04:39.539> to<00:04:39.629> protein<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.319> it<00:04:40.620> will<00:04:41.069> look<00:04:41.099> at

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
it comes to protein so it will look at

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.559 
it comes to protein so it will look at
it<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.669> face<00:04:41.939> and<00:04:42.180> say<00:04:42.300> no<00:04:42.599> way<00:04:43.009> so<00:04:44.009> um

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
it's expensive and i'll put the link in

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.409 
it's expensive and i'll put the link in
the<00:04:54.330> box<00:04:54.659> to<00:04:55.110> their<00:04:55.530> website<00:04:56.009> or<00:04:56.039> whatever<00:04:56.430> but

the box to their website or whatever but

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.339 
the box to their website or whatever but
um<00:04:58.250> yeah<00:04:59.250> minimal<00:04:59.909> slip<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.689> protein<00:05:01.139> and<00:05:01.229> it

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
um yeah minimal slip the protein and it

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.450 
um yeah minimal slip the protein and it
gave<00:05:01.500> me<00:05:01.529> issues<00:05:02.870> for<00:05:03.870> me<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.740> way<00:05:04.949> that<00:05:04.979> I

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
gave me issues for me the way that I

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.290 
gave me issues for me the way that I
that<00:05:06.389> it<00:05:06.569> works<00:05:06.900> best<00:05:07.610> for<00:05:08.610> me<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:09.560> when<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:11.300> put

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
that it works best for me is when I put

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.140 
that it works best for me is when I put
I<00:05:12.509> mix<00:05:13.139> it<00:05:13.229> with<00:05:13.349> something<00:05:13.529> so<00:05:14.219> like<00:05:14.460> I'd<00:05:14.819> mix

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
I mix it with something so like I'd mix

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.300 
I mix it with something so like I'd mix
this<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.689> my<00:05:15.810> Jesse<00:05:16.169> curl<00:05:16.379> together<00:05:16.740> or<00:05:17.039> I'd

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
this and my Jesse curl together or I'd

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.170 
this and my Jesse curl together or I'd
mix<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:18.300> um<00:05:19.490> come<00:05:20.490> on<00:05:20.639> Austin<00:05:20.909> I<00:05:20.969> mix

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.059 
mix this and um come on Austin I mix
with<00:05:21.360> trust<00:05:21.900> my<00:05:22.020> naturals<00:05:22.560> or<00:05:22.800> what<00:05:22.919> I've<00:05:23.039> just

to give it a little bit more slip or
whatever<00:05:25.439> and<00:05:26.479> that's<00:05:27.479> why<00:05:27.779> it<00:05:27.840> works<00:05:28.050> best

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
whatever and that's why it works best

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
for me when I mix it with something and

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.089 
for me when I mix it with something and
like<00:05:30.659> put<00:05:30.960> some<00:05:31.110> honey<00:05:31.289> in<00:05:31.409> it<00:05:31.620> or<00:05:31.889> whatever
