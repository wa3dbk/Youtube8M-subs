full<00:00:53.530> charge<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.579> procedure<00:00:54.940> does

full charge and that procedure does
actually<00:00:55.600> harm<00:00:56.050> them<00:00:56.340> instead<00:00:57.340> you'd<00:00:57.670> be<00:00:57.910> much

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
actually harm them instead you'd be much

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.880 
actually harm them instead you'd be much
better<00:00:58.149> off<00:00:58.480> with<00:00:58.840> shallow<00:00:59.140> infrequent

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
better off with shallow infrequent

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.639

charges<00:01:00.309> according<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.600> experts<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.410> sweet

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
charges according to experts the sweet

charges according to experts the sweet
spot<00:01:02.949> is<00:01:03.190> something<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.789> between<00:01:03.879> 50<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.629> 80

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
spot is something in between 50 and 80

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.410 
spot is something in between 50 and 80
percent<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:06.100> stick<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.429> the<00:01:06.670> range<00:01:06.970> when<00:01:07.270> you

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
percent so stick to the range when you

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.150 
percent so stick to the range when you
can

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
can

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.380 
can
besides<00:01:09.160> lithium<00:01:09.759> batteries<00:01:10.179> have<00:01:10.360> a

lifespan based on charge cycles so the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.029 
lifespan based on charge cycles so the
