you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> throw<00:01:55.770> Tom<00:01:56.040> Brady<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.880> think

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you can throw Tom Brady and I just think

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
you can throw Tom Brady and I just think
that<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> he's<00:01:57.810> had<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.950> been<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that the he's had has just been so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
that the he's had has just been so
fantastic<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.969> should<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.299> rewarded<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.020> war

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
fantastic it should be rewarded the war

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.039 
fantastic it should be rewarded the war
has<00:02:01.619> been<00:02:01.799> shared<00:02:02.399> elder<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> other<00:02:03.119> times<00:02:03.420> so

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
has been shared elder and other times so

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
has been shared elder and other times so
I<00:02:04.079> don't<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.770> why<00:02:04.979> they<00:02:05.159> can't<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I don't see why they can't have if the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.969 
I don't see why they can't have if the
vote<00:02:06.000> says<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> tie<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.799> there's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
vote says that it's a tie then there's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
vote says that it's a tie then there's
Co<00:02:08.190> MVPs<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> has<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> shake<00:02:10.020> out

Bay<00:04:15.079> i<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.489> think<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.389> Harbaugh<00:04:17.959> has

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
Bay i I just think that Harbaugh has

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.589 
Bay i I just think that Harbaugh has
something<00:04:19.159> going<00:04:19.430> especially<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.419> defense

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
something going especially on defense

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.690 
something going especially on defense
and<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.169> is<00:04:21.349> one<00:04:21.560> where<00:04:21.769> defense<00:04:22.340> will

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
and this is one where defense will

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.610 
and this is one where defense will
cancel<00:04:23.240> great<00:04:23.510> offense<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.139> this<00:04:24.229> is

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
cancel great offense and this is

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.650 
cancel great offense and this is
great<00:04:24.919> offense<00:04:25.370> but<00:04:26.000> they<00:04:26.180> played<00:04:26.449> great

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
great offense but they played great

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.420 
great offense but they played great
defense<00:04:27.229> they're<00:04:27.410> gonna<00:04:27.560> be<00:04:27.650> rested<00:04:28.130> that's<00:04:28.310> a
