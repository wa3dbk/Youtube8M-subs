 I'm a monkey and I take over the channel 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.260
 do not 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.260
 no no 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.690
 [Applause] 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.460
 a new video here I'm looking at this 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.619
 case I come to do an iphone boxing 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.630
 6 and finally finally asked me for a mobile 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.640
 to see is that I did not have a cell phone or it was never 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 I had a mobile on a smartphone 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.119
 rather, because mobile did have 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250
 but that is not me since it will be a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.780
 tusk and boom of the following smartphone 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.360
 whatsapp that this topic then I was 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.010
 totally how to say it against 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.660
 all of this, so to speak 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 somewhat strange section but I do not know 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 I never wore it got me well with 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.310
 mobile phones and I do not think that's 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.719
 that for example there is a meeting except 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.180
 the world with the mobile what the people 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.829
 down the street instead of looking at the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.239
 nature or buildings because we 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.559
 we direct good nature the case that 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.480
 people put on for time that the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.980
 moment of the day and that because no no no is not 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.750
 I was against but good at home that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.329
 formed with very against that this one already 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.309
 the world moves by the mobiles 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.710
 well not only for that you know but 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.870
 and everyone uses a mobile phone and 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.850
 we need we already need mobile yes or yes 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.320
 I needed jawai to need everything 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.600
 but urgent 20 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.650
 so finally I got caught my first 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.650
 mobile and start 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.820
 iPhone 6 and even the pretty little box 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820
 advertisements 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.190
 Acosta a good shepherd of things like 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.290
 but I liked this mobile that 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.690
 it's always the one I've always had channel 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 eye, I think it's going to be necessary 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.039
 cutter filho of the good because it gives me 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.780
 that my nails are not trained to 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.390
 cut this plastic because this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.210
 plastic has a unique win 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.190
 we will have to do mega course 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.899
 reuters 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.940
 the identical unclean cutter so we're going to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.940
 have a boxing 2 iphone 6 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 It is very important and I have done it because 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 I understand nothing of mobile but as 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 many things 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.660
 pit and why you want to see so 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.160
 because nobody is black because the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.540
 other colors do not cool me go and the black 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 if I was cool because it is in plan as well 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.490
 more yale than before and I am very 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
 elegant boy please that there is not even 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.960
 what question do you value very carefully 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.030
 let's go opening here 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.320
 my mother is that I'm afraid to put the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.340
 cutter knows that this is precisely the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.200
 screen and Ã¡lava left quite uncle 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.200
 and this plastic that anti-nuclear 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.590
 in my house of this same plastic guys 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.010
 then already when a nuclear bomb 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.260
 to survive is breaking is is 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.020
 breaking light green light green I repeat light 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.780
 green 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.780
 but my mother this plastic 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.750
 then scooter out and quite far 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.660
 because I am very dangerous and that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.459
 let's have a misfortune open to me 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.080
 I put here because it's a box and in which 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.940
 it is not at all because it is a bit boring 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.620
 you already have it, we remove the mega 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.000
 plastic or super mega anti nuclear the and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.760
 it's painted and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 as it opens this will not tilt the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.690
 camera a little bit down like here and 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.520
 that will not know if they suffer had been the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.990
 first person who was who made a 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.400
 I change a house of this that fell on 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.440
 mobile that babies so we're going to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.730
 do very subtly with a lot 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.940
 be careful, you will see the other three that I 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.940
 OK 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.980
 there it goes comes the cucumber comes 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.970

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 my mother house let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.620
 we go 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.620
 [Music] 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:02.280
 and holding with fingers 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.239
 it looks like a mobile like any really 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.120
 but but it has the manzanita behind it 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.950
 we get out of here and it's here we have the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.250
 shell let's see first that inside 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.250
 box 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:26.010
 look already has the thickness of the spaghetti 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.199
 he is handsome but very very handsome 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.449
 [Music] 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:47.380
 here we have the box 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:51.180
 this weird plastic around here another 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.180
 plastic rare plastic 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.150
 and here we have a plug to see quite 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.820
 good a plug to plug things in 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.280
 it's strange that for it to be supposed 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.600
 to load it obviously and here we have 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.600
 the charger cable 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.770
 because not only and here we have the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.410
 music listening caps 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.569
 damn professional with the manzanita of 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.409
 back obviously he hears why because he's 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:28.000
 marketing or an apple of never what 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:30.759
 I will really understand is that I do not understand and 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.770
 racism towards the other fruits by 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.330
 poor dishes and for more famous wait 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.250
 what is the apple being good 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.810
 by saying here you have an iphone of 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.560
 media is well written the reflected 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.020
 gave there what you have is very handsome very very 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.479
 handsome the back part and in plan 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.659
 debit 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:54.520
 that is reflected all this appears a 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.990
 mirror word the 16 gb is the only 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.020
 data that I can give next I understand 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.610
 this if it has gone 16 gigas can be 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.909
 put more card thing so you have 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.919
 more space to put pictures and that's it 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:11.560
 step as this I will all put in and 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:16.629
 whatsapp below you can not continue on 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.190
 facebook but it's too much time 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.050
 I think they turned on mobile as soon as 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.009
 would ignite the pile of 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.520
 so calls 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.520
 I can not 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:41.310
 it is better to try it before anything does not go to 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:44.940
 to be a bit so it's better to leave 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.430
 the cake of the store said this I 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:51.229
 everything here you have it pim pam pim pum 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:56.870

 as very fragile and good what was said 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.210
 700 turkeys 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.210
 lying down this 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:10.689
 I do not know to what extent he has left the 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:12.039
 hands but it has appeared to leave it 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:16.270
 eat it mobile you have to see 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.919
 if that stops to know it also and 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.110
 nothing then leave what you think of the iphone and 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.939
 do there is a mobile debate no no 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.849

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.740

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.300
 and that android I do not like is not 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.860
 simply complex because he wants 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.629
 try it basically android badly said 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.129

 let my life and my years go by and 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.129
 everything nothing is being caged and 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:44.349
