00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 recording and so went on a table scheme 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.450
 headlight range control 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.450
 disassembled state 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.669
 here we see 2 motors correctors 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.329
 The drive removed consists of a rod and the 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:25.890
 stepper motor 2 pieces 2 drivers 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:28.980
 motor stepper motors and controller 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.289
 here which I gathered krayushki see 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.280
 it from the power cord that feeds into this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.110
 12 volt man say assembled 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.589
 scheme on the table 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:47.659
 tests now we are feeding from 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:51.000
 give the first thing that happened fell 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.519
 controller because on it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.619
 vibration motor and just stupidly rolled 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.739
 vibration motor and by the way it is enough 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:02.580
 powerful and all this design is enough 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 sensitive vibrates it was evident that 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.430
 the correctors moved down and climbed 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290
 maximum when power is applied and generally 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.190
 is when the stepping motor turns on in 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.720
 work the first thing that happens is stepper 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.990
 motor must understand in what position 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.660
 is undergoing self testing 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.040
 motors 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.080
 reach zero position then 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.280
 rises to the working position then 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.780
 which programmed and into the controller 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.960
 that's why when powering they 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.810
 go to zero then rises on 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.150
 a certain level of well default 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 programmed half claude 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.070
 working stock i mean well he say 50 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.370
 percent rise is average. farther 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.490
 control such a shawl closer 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.030
 tried to show their visible ring 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.720
 from mouse from mouse 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.450
 usually that is shorter the algorithm is simple 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.070
 cool rises that is here i start 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 twist here it starts at me to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:15.410
 rise and step not only begins 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.010
 go down here he reached the maximum at 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.569
 the stop at the minimum starts spinning in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.410
 this vibrator is starting 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.020
 I don't know whether to vibrate or not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.890
 video here so here it is visible turns at 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.790
 this wheel itself can be seen as vibrating 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.530
 the same thing if i lift all the way into 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.900
 another point here it is, respectively 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.540
 choose attach became this will be heard 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:49.340
 even audible also vibrates mean 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:54.890
 position here is the midpoint passage 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.959
 displayed by a slight vibration then 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.920
 there is just understand what is average 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.709
 position here there is a button well as long as she 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.030
 I have something to reset 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.230
 motor position middle position then 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.120
 there is here I press the wheel clicked 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.299
 time passes and the motor returns 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.810
 midpoint sweat since this is still 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.519
 the test piece of iron was not checked then 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.799
 there is then more likely I 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.900
 I will do here a long press to reset 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.850
 motor position ie they must 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.769
 fully positioned ah 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.400
 step back to zero return to 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:40.010
 Worker until such a scheme on the table 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.489
 that's enough as I can around here 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.630
 no point principle all explanations 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:58.790
 finished studying here so complicated 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:59.739
 there is no here it looks like the wheel itself 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.660
 corrector 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.610
 close distance well, basically nothing 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.560
 Details on so she herself 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.780
 the wheel fits it all eats three 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.290
 days postings 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.090
 plus or minus, and h and ling data 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.980
 accordingly wiring diagram 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.140
 in parallel are connected correctly 2 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.000
 drivers and the controller itself 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.720
 Well, respectively, the individual wires 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 connects to motor drivers there once 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.760
 two three 4 5 wire motor goes 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.860
 one screen is better wire and from coils by 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.860
 a pair of wires 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.860
 everything
