00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 during the 2014 elections the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.279
 The national registry will do the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.120
 deployment of larger biometrics in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.040
 history of the country 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 this is our central theme and for 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 develop it with us edward julián 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.920
 ortegón serna support coordinator 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 electoral technician of the registry 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 national of civil status 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.199
 welcome sign up and that is a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.650
 biometric system 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.390
 a biometric system is the way of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.820
 automatically identify the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 citizens for which the registration 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 uses the fingerprint of the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.510
 minutes and what biometrics consists of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 electoral election biometrics 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.649
 it consists in identifying the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 citizens eligible to pay in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.489
 determined polling station which 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.739
 It is done through the making of the footprint 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 citizen's fingerprint and it is checked 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.719
 against the minutiae that you have 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.160
 stored in the database of the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 national registry very well in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.640
 colombia we are very advanced in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 matter of biometrics but I'm interested 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 much that you know more about the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.949
 beginnings of biometrics the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.600
 implementation of identification 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.590
 geometric for voters has been 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.660
 become a tool 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.909
 indispensable to guarantee the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 transparency in the elections 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.740
 according to judgments of the state council 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.469
 in the years 2002 and 2006 the most fraud 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 recurrent was by impersonation in the 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.719
 elections thanks to this as it is taken 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.270
 the option to make an authentication of 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.590
 readers 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 by means of biometrics 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 was in 2008 in the consultation of the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.810
 political parties when implemented 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.929
 the first pilot test in the cities 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.149
 from bogotá medellín cali barranquilla 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.549
 using 76 biometric readers and the 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.770
 February 22, 2009 in the municipality of 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.750
 Andaquíes nativity scene in Caquetá 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.880
 officially used biometrics in the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.100
 atypical election of the mayor of this 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.740
 municipality from this moment and to the date 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.149
 67 elections have been held in the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.299
 that identification has been used 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.439
 biometric for voters where they 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.780
 locate the identification equipment 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.429
 biometrics on election day 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.679
 equipment is located at the entrance of the 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.349
 polling stations in order to 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.209
 also give information to the voter 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.660
 whether or not it is enabled for 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.950
 pay in certain then this 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.840
 It is also done so that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.459
 polling station only enter 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.180
 the people who are enabled to 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.040
 vote in that place but that day only 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.110
 it does biometric authentication to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.090
 citizens who are going to vote or they also 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.459
 makes the actors in the process the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.769
 other actors additional to citizens 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.000
 it is authentic that the juries of 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.430
 vote 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 is the time the registration begins at 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.380
 from 7 in the morning 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.760
 and until there is full 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.080
 identity of each of the degrees of 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 votes are not allowed to enter the venue 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.700
 very well let's see how the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.890
 biometrics and what this process consists of 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.840
 biometric identification has been 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.310
 become the right mechanism for 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.110
 prevent impersonation of voters in 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 the electoral elections consists of 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.470
 fully identify the voter has 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.540
 upon arrival at the polling station delivery 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.920
 the cedula to the official this happens the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.750
 document by the code reader of 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.540
 bars and the device will throw the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.540
 data of the person is going to light the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 citizen fingerprint button 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.050
 will put the footprint and what the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.690
 biometric authentication machine is 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.000
 compare the data of the cell with the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 fingerprint will confront if it is or 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 not the owner of the cell after the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.090
 Verify the authentication machine 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.010
 biometric throws the certificate of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 validation and subsequently the citizen 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.970
 will go to the polling station where 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.209
 will exercise their right to vote is worth saying 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.000
 which contains the census of the municipality 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.410
 of the municipality and also contains the base 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 of data identifying the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.519
 citizens who are going to vote in that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.420
 municipality in case the team of 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.010
 biometrics 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.450
 the footprint the delegate of the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.790
 registration at the polling station 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.140
 you should check that that person is 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.270
 who says he is and who is 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.550
 qualified to vote 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.590
 It is mandatory that the citizen present 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.230
 your citizenship card at the time of 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.510
 perform the biometric identification is 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.580
 does more for effects than to be able to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.670
 vote must be submitted the document of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.560
 the original citizenship cell without 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.830
 However, in the event that some 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.720
 citizen who is a voting jury 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.490
 take your citizenship card you can 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.430
 individualize by taking the 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.739
 footprint and you can determine if it is or not 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.989
 is the person clear and apart from the day of 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.970
 voting biometrics is used in 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.670
 other activities of the electoral process 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.130
 clear for this process as such the 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.900
 registry implemented a system of 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.520
 automated citizenship registration the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.930
 which is also the imposition of 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.350
 the fingerprint at the time of 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.260
 make your registration in a way 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.660
 automatic and this footprint is crossed against 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.370
 the database that has the 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.840
 registration at the national level for 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.460
 be able to individualize citizens 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.290
 well, in the bar julián norte with 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.670
 serna thank you very much for sharing 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.270
 with our viewers all this 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.960
 information 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.960
 Thank you
