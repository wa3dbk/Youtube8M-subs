concern<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.850> never<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.360> happen

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
concern you never know what will happen

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.270 
concern you never know what will happen
in<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.610> his<00:01:12.150> best<00:01:12.450> shot<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
in this part this was his best shot to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
in this part this was his best shot to
getting<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.350> fight

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
getting back up there it was this fight

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.929 
getting back up there it was this fight
but<00:01:16.950> he<00:01:17.220> got<00:01:18.060> knocked<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.850> looking<00:01:20.850> at

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
but he got knocked out and looking at

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.490 
but he got knocked out and looking at
his<00:01:21.060> resume<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.049> he<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.380> has

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
his resume I don't think he really has

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.340 
his resume I don't think he really has
the<00:01:22.530> power<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.070> give<00:01:23.580> anyone<00:01:24.420> problems<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the power to give anyone problems in the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.710 
the power to give anyone problems in the
heavyweight<00:01:25.590> division<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.420> he<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.540> get

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
heavyweight division and he would get

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499 
heavyweight division and he would get
destroyed<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> other<00:01:28.710> top<00:01:29.009> guys<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:30.240> top

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
destroyed by the other top guys like top

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.920 
destroyed by the other top guys like top
maybe<00:01:31.020> even<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.530> 30<00:01:31.829> guys<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.369> destroy<00:01:32.729> him

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
maybe even top 30 guys will destroy him

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
maybe even top 30 guys will destroy him
so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.140> he<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> retire<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> try

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so I think he should just retire and try

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240 
so I think he should just retire and try
to<00:01:35.909> find<00:01:36.450> another<00:01:36.600> job<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.320> try<00:01:37.740> training

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
to find another job or try training

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.609
