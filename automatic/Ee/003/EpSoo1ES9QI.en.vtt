hi welcome back well spring is in full

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.050 
hi welcome back well spring is in full
bloom<00:00:05.009> here<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:05.580> getting<00:00:05.640> ready<00:00:05.879> for

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
bloom here and we're getting ready for

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.330 
bloom here and we're getting ready for
our<00:00:06.150> spring<00:00:06.509> projects<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.010> them<00:00:08.250> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
our spring projects one of them this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.390 
our spring projects one of them this
year<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.880> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.240> be<00:00:09.530> replacing<00:00:10.530> our<00:00:10.950> filter

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
year is going to be replacing our filter

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
year is going to be replacing our filter
on<00:00:11.580> our<00:00:11.730> pond<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:13.080> pond<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.679> been

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
on our pond here this pond has been

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.039 
on our pond here this pond has been
around<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:14.670> maybe<00:00:14.940> 15<00:00:15.450> years<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
around for a little maybe 15 years and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.460 
around for a little maybe 15 years and
the<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.279> normally<00:00:17.640> do<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.109> filtration<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the way we normally do the filtration is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.400 
the way we normally do the filtration is
as<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.520> see<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> bog<00:00:21.779> an

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
as you can see here we have a bog an

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.429 
as you can see here we have a bog an
order<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.189> pumps<00:00:23.640> through<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> bog<00:00:24.439> through

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
order just pumps through the bog through

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
order just pumps through the bog through
the<00:00:25.590> plants<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.279> put<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> pipes<00:00:27.210> filled<00:00:27.510> up

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the plants that put the pipes filled up

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.439 
the plants that put the pipes filled up
and<00:00:27.840> nutrients<00:00:28.199> then<00:00:28.349> back<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> bog

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
and nutrients then back into the bog

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.500 
and nutrients then back into the bog
what<00:00:30.449> we're<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.940> since<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.300> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
what we're going to do since because we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
what we're going to do since because we
want<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.780> remove<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.920> filter<00:00:35.280> here

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
want to remove this little filter here

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.650 
want to remove this little filter here
is<00:00:36.860> more<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.000> here

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is more what we have going on over here

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.860 
is more what we have going on over here
we've<00:00:40.440> taken<00:00:40.649> out<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> plants<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> we're

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
we've taken out all the plants and we're

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
we've taken out all the plants and we're
going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> drain<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.500> put<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> manifold<00:00:44.820> system

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
going to drain it put a manifold system

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.979 
going to drain it put a manifold system
in<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:47.480> impede<00:00:48.480> gravel<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:48.960> top

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
in there and then impede gravel on top

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
in there and then impede gravel on top
of<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.559> plan<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.190> plants

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of it and then plan to do with plants

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.150 
of it and then plan to do with plants
directly<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> pea<00:00:51.270> gravel<00:00:51.530> I<00:00:52.530> picked<00:00:53.039> this

out<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:04.949> ours<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
out here because ours is going to be a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.570 
out here because ours is going to be a
much<00:01:05.909> higher<00:01:06.119> flow<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.580> mainly

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
much higher flow than what is was mainly

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
much higher flow than what is was mainly
because<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> run<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.600> waterfall

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
because we have to run this waterfall

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.280 
because we have to run this waterfall
right<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> drained

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
right here so I'm gonna get this drained

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
right here so I'm gonna get this drained
out<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.680> I'll<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:14.850> soon<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.210> do

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
out and I'll be back as soon as I do

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.460 
out and I'll be back as soon as I do
okay<00:01:16.880> we're<00:01:17.880> back<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
okay we're back now you can see that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
okay we're back now you can see that
I've<00:01:19.619> already<00:01:20.040> gone<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.729> created<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I've already gone and created the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960 
I've already gone and created the
manifold<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> manifold<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> same<00:01:23.759> as

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
manifold the manifold is the same as

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
manifold the manifold is the same as
shown<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.540> other<00:01:24.689> videos<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.619> same<00:01:25.830> basic

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
shown in the other videos the same basic

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.660 
shown in the other videos the same basic
construction<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.040> over

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
construction but the difference is over

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
construction but the difference is over
here<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> make<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> 45-degree<00:01:31.320> angle

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
here we had to make the 45-degree angle

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
here we had to make the 45-degree angle
since<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> retrofit<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.030> existing

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
since this is a retrofit to an existing

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.069 
since this is a retrofit to an existing
bog<00:01:34.290> area<00:01:34.909> also<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.090> we've<00:01:36.240> done<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.869> take

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bog area also what we've done you take

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
bog area also what we've done you take
note<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:40.549> rock<00:01:41.549> standing<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
note that we have rock standing of the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.069 
note that we have rock standing of the
heavy<00:01:43.020> cobble<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.790> uneven<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
heavy cobble this was uneven so what I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.190 
heavy cobble this was uneven so what I
did<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.590> went<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.149> filled<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.299> partially

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
did is I went and filled it partially

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
did is I went and filled it partially
with<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.159> heavy<00:01:50.340> cobble<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> would<00:01:51.329> rest

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
with the heavy cobble so this would rest

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.749 
with the heavy cobble so this would rest
on<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> fairly<00:01:51.990> flat<00:01:52.229> surface<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.460> I'll<00:01:53.579> do

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
on a fairly flat surface what I'll do

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
on a fairly flat surface what I'll do
next<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.540> I'll<00:01:54.899> come<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.560> some<00:01:55.710> more

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
next is I'll come in here with some more

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.690 
next is I'll come in here with some more
cobble<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.310> fill<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.909> around<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
cobble and fill in back around with the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.230 
cobble and fill in back around with the

I'd hate to have this little tube over

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.300 
I'd hate to have this little tube over
here<00:02:11.550> burst<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.599> soak<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:12.989> camera<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:13.980> we'll

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
here burst and soak my camera so we'll

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.020 
here burst and soak my camera so we'll
be<00:02:14.400> back<00:02:14.640> soon<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:16.220> okay<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.459> all<00:02:17.550> turned<00:02:17.819> on

be back soon I okay it's all turned on
and<00:02:18.239> fired<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.930> looks<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.379> had

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and fired up and it looks like we had

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220 
and fired up and it looks like we had
successful<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> first<00:02:20.610> truck<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.959> only

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
successful in the first truck the only

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.800 
successful in the first truck the only
thing<00:02:22.379> I<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.709> suggest<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
thing I can suggest to you is when you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
thing I can suggest to you is when you
put<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.110> together<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.129> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.580> be<00:02:26.670> a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
put this together this is going to be a

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330 
put this together this is going to be a
closed<00:02:27.120> system<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.620> means<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> be

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
closed system which means is going to be

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.059 
closed system which means is going to be
air<00:02:29.520> trapped<00:02:29.940> inside<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.720> had<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.560> go<00:02:31.709> in<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
air trapped inside it I had to go in and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.890 
air trapped inside it I had to go in and
drill<00:02:32.340> several<00:02:33.330> strategically<00:02:34.200> placed<00:02:34.470> holes

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
drill several strategically placed holes

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
drill several strategically placed holes
in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.290> pipe<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.980> let<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> air<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.430> once<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
in the pipe to let the air out once the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.530 
in the pipe to let the air out once the
air<00:02:39.300> was<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.989> sunk<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:41.060> sank<00:02:42.060> down<00:02:42.269> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
air was out it sunk it it's sank down it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.960 
air was out it sunk it it's sank down it
was<00:02:42.660> fine<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:44.310> yeah<00:02:44.489> you're<00:02:44.670> gonna<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:44.849> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
was fine but yeah you're gonna have to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.530 
was fine but yeah you're gonna have to
get<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> arrow<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.260> what<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.519> now<00:02:50.540> both

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
get the arrow and what we have now both

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.119 
get the arrow and what we have now both
waterfalls<00:02:53.239> functioning<00:02:54.239> fine<00:02:54.890> now<00:02:55.890> I'll

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
waterfalls functioning fine now I'll

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.890 
waterfalls functioning fine now I'll
have<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> do<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.000> next<00:02:57.980> time<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.340> next

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
have to do is the next time my next

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.270 
have to do is the next time my next
experiment<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.260> filling<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.709> up<00:03:01.769> partially

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
experiment we filling it up partially

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.970 
experiment we filling it up partially
with<00:03:02.400> gravel<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> turning<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.390> back<00:03:03.420> on

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
with gravel and and turning it back on

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.270 
with gravel and and turning it back on
see<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.099> then<00:03:05.280> okay<00:03:05.690> we're<00:03:06.690> back<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.280> we

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
see you then okay we're back and we

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.460 
see you then okay we're back and we
filled<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.849> thing<00:03:09.120> with<00:03:09.330> halfway<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.319> with

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
filled this thing with halfway up with

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.059 
filled this thing with halfway up with
the<00:03:10.650> pea<00:03:11.430> gravel<00:03:11.629> and<00:03:12.629> bubble<00:03:13.080> wash<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:13.890> pea

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
the pea gravel and bubble wash your pea

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.440 
the pea gravel and bubble wash your pea
gravel<00:03:14.280> first<00:03:14.700> otherwise<00:03:15.000> you're<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.360> to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
gravel first otherwise you're going to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.670 
gravel first otherwise you're going to
line<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:15.629> with<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.930> pond<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.349> looks<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
line up with a pond it looks like a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.430 
line up with a pond it looks like a
muddle

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
muddle

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.380 
muddle
so<00:03:19.440> far<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:20.010> had<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> little<00:03:20.670> effect<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
so far it's had a little effect on the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.430 
so far it's had a little effect on the
honey<00:03:22.849> on<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.060> waterfall<00:03:24.659> over<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.290> not

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
honey on the waterfall over here but not

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.559 
honey on the waterfall over here but not
much<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:26.010> probably<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:26.670> much<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.090> factor

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
much it's probably as much the factor

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.410 
much it's probably as much the factor
more<00:03:28.470> resistance<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.299> is

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
more resistance on that one and there is

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.589 
more resistance on that one and there is
on<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:30.959> over<00:03:31.110> here<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> we're<00:03:33.420> going<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
on this one over here so we're going to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.509 
on this one over here so we're going to
fill<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.989> rest<00:03:34.080> align<00:03:34.349> summit<00:03:34.650> apples<00:03:34.980> be

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
fill out the rest align summit apples be

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.570 
fill out the rest align summit apples be
back<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:35.970> little<00:03:36.000> bit<00:03:37.190> okay<00:03:38.190> here<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.549> go

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
back in a little bit okay here we go

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.300 
back in a little bit okay here we go
it's<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.360> completed<00:03:39.930> project<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.950> least<00:03:41.129> on

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
it's a completed project at least on

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580 
it's a completed project at least on
this<00:03:41.430> side<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:42.569> have<00:03:42.750> all<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.049> gravel<00:03:43.440> in

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
this side we have all the gravel in

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.570 
this side we have all the gravel in
we've<00:03:44.069> taken<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.150> plants<00:03:45.870> out<00:03:46.340> washed<00:03:47.340> off

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
we've taken the plants out washed off

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.000 
we've taken the plants out washed off
the<00:03:47.610> roots<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:49.200> back<00:03:49.379> that<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.709> can<00:03:49.799> see<00:03:49.860> a

the roots in the back that you can see a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.710 
the roots in the back that you can see a
couple<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.370> marshmallow<00:03:50.909> golds<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.629> the

the greenhouse and we're going to see

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.460 
the greenhouse and we're going to see
how<00:03:59.939> they<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.390> here<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.750> year<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.319> real

test<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.099> thing<00:04:02.370> will<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.670> when<00:04:02.790> we<00:04:02.909> go<00:04:03.030> to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
test of this thing will be when we go to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.390 
test of this thing will be when we go to
pull<00:04:03.360> em<00:04:03.480> out<00:04:03.599> at<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> end<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.950> year<00:04:05.129> see

pull em out at the end of the year see

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.210 
pull em out at the end of the year see
how<00:04:05.549> invasive<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.269> roots<00:04:06.480> would<00:04:06.599> become<00:04:07.220> does

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
how invasive the roots would become does

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.500 
how invasive the roots would become does
we're<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.640> turn<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.879> on<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.239> can<00:04:09.269> see

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
we're going to turn it on you can see

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:21.390 
we're going to turn it on you can see
how<00:04:09.629> it<00:04:09.720> looks

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
you can see the water's coming up

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.170 
you can see the water's coming up
already<00:04:24.379> it<00:04:24.979> only<00:04:25.189> sits<00:04:25.460> about<00:04:25.729> a<00:04:25.759> half<00:04:26.000> inch

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
already it only sits about a half inch

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.999 
already it only sits about a half inch
below<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.689> surface<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.379> rocks<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:33.139> it's

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
below the surface of the rocks and it's

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.429 
below the surface of the rocks and it's
the<00:04:34.280> five<00:04:35.000> way<00:04:35.180> I've<00:04:35.300> got<00:04:35.479> this<00:04:35.659> set<00:04:35.719> up<00:04:36.050> is<00:04:36.259> it

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:36.439 
the five way I've got this set up is it

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.159 
the five way I've got this set up is it
comes<00:04:36.889> in<00:04:37.039> here<00:04:37.219> and<00:04:37.310> it<00:04:37.430> floods<00:04:37.780> twice<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> day

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
comes in here and it floods twice a day

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.459 
comes in here and it floods twice a day
for<00:04:39.560> about<00:04:39.650> three<00:04:40.159> hours<00:04:40.189> each<00:04:41.229> we<00:04:42.229> get<00:04:42.379> the

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469 
for about three hours each we get the

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:50.409 
for about three hours each we get the
waterfalls<00:04:42.889> going<00:04:43.389> which<00:04:44.389> is<00:04:44.960> over<00:04:45.319> here<00:04:49.419> and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
fairly well give it a try all I can say

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.379 
fairly well give it a try all I can say
is<00:05:24.110> do<00:05:25.039> build<00:05:25.789> it<00:05:25.969> just<00:05:26.659> like<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:28.639> one<00:05:28.909> in<00:05:29.210> the

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
is do build it just like the one in the

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.529 
is do build it just like the one in the
in<00:05:29.719> the<00:05:29.900> video<00:05:30.860> from<00:05:31.129> the<00:05:31.340> pond<00:05:31.610> digger<00:05:31.819> and

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
in the video from the pond digger and

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.939 
in the video from the pond digger and
build<00:05:33.319> it<00:05:33.469> pick<00:05:34.159> one<00:05:34.460> end<00:05:34.789> and<00:05:35.740> cement<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.830> all

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
build it pick one end and cement it all

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.439 
build it pick one end and cement it all
together<00:05:37.099> from<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:37.580> one<00:05:37.759> end<00:05:37.940> because<00:05:38.300> if

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
together from that one end because if

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.209 
together from that one end because if
you<00:05:38.539> don't<00:05:38.779> it's<00:05:39.589> not<00:05:39.800> going<00:05:39.979> to<00:05:40.039> match<00:05:40.190> up

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
you don't it's not going to match up

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.930 
you don't it's not going to match up
when<00:05:40.639> you<00:05:40.729> try<00:05:40.909> and<00:05:40.969> plug<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> all<00:05:41.449> together

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
when you try and plug it all together

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
when you try and plug it all together
test<00:05:43.940> me<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.180> know<00:05:44.949> so<00:05:45.949> there<00:05:46.879> you<00:05:46.940> go<00:05:47.089> give<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.839> a

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
test me I know so there you go give it a

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.920 
test me I know so there you go give it a
try<00:05:47.990> we'll<00:05:48.770> be<00:05:48.889> doing<00:05:49.159> updates<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.699> low<00:05:49.849> on<00:05:50.060> it

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
try we'll be doing updates and low on it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.350

down<00:06:29.449> here<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:30.319> can<00:06:30.469> see<00:06:30.650> that<00:06:31.060> at<00:06:32.060> fitting

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
down here you can see that at fitting

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.700 
down here you can see that at fitting
but<00:06:33.680> in<00:06:33.860> that<00:06:33.979> fitting<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.940> can<00:06:35.090> see<00:06:35.300> the

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
but in that fitting you can see the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.800 
but in that fitting you can see the
water<00:06:36.710> rippling<00:06:37.009> around<00:06:37.520> it<00:06:37.669> there<00:06:37.879> there's<00:06:38.719> a

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
water rippling around it there there's a

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.080 
water rippling around it there there's a
hole<00:06:39.110> drilled<00:06:39.590> in<00:06:39.680> the<00:06:39.800> side<00:06:40.039> to<00:06:40.699> break<00:06:40.879> the

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
hole drilled in the side to break the

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.529 
hole drilled in the side to break the
suction<00:06:41.500> when<00:06:42.500> when<00:06:43.039> the<00:06:43.190> pump<00:06:43.699> goes<00:06:43.909> off<00:06:44.150> you

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:44.539 
suction when when the pump goes off you

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.719 
suction when when the pump goes off you
don't<00:06:44.690> put<00:06:44.840> that<00:06:44.960> hole<00:06:45.259> in<00:06:45.469> there<00:06:45.729> that

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
don't put that hole in there that

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.270 
don't put that hole in there that
suction<00:06:47.210> will<00:06:47.360> drain<00:06:47.719> the<00:06:48.289> bog<00:06:48.500> all<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.159> way

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
suction will drain the bog all the way

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.459 
suction will drain the bog all the way
down<00:06:49.550> to<00:06:49.849> where<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.300> manifold<00:06:50.780> is<00:06:50.930> inserted

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
down to where the manifold is inserted

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.459 
down to where the manifold is inserted
which<00:06:52.310> you<00:06:52.669> don't<00:06:52.969> want<00:06:53.030> you<00:06:53.419> want<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.659> stop

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:54.469 
which you don't want you want to stop

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:56.439 
which you don't want you want to stop
maybe<00:06:54.830> about<00:06:55.129> a<00:06:55.159> half<00:06:55.430> inch<00:06:55.610> below<00:06:55.879> the<00:06:56.060> gravel

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
maybe about a half inch below the gravel

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.540 
maybe about a half inch below the gravel
so<00:06:57.199> wherever<00:06:57.440> you<00:06:57.710> want<00:06:57.889> the<00:06:57.979> water<00:06:58.129> to<00:06:58.250> stop

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
so wherever you want the water to stop

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.339 
so wherever you want the water to stop
just<00:06:58.849> drill<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.150> hole<00:06:59.449> in<00:07:00.409> your<00:07:00.740> plumbing<00:07:02.229> so<00:07:03.229> it

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
just drill a hole in your plumbing so it

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.149 
just drill a hole in your plumbing so it
sucks<00:07:03.650> air<00:07:03.889> and<00:07:04.039> breaks<00:07:04.279> the<00:07:05.349> the<00:07:06.349> suction<00:07:07.039> on

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
sucks air and breaks the the suction on

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.540 
sucks air and breaks the the suction on
you<00:07:07.509> on<00:07:08.509> the<00:07:08.719> water<00:07:08.949> works<00:07:09.949> pretty<00:07:10.219> good<00:07:10.400> we've

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
you on the water works pretty good we've

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.040 
you on the water works pretty good we've
been<00:07:10.669> using<00:07:11.000> that<00:07:11.180> method<00:07:11.569> in<00:07:11.659> here<00:07:11.810> now<00:07:11.990> for

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
been using that method in here now for

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.760 
been using that method in here now for
15<00:07:12.590> years<00:07:13.270> but<00:07:14.270> that's<00:07:14.479> about<00:07:14.719> it

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
15 years but that's about it

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.640 
15 years but that's about it
let<00:07:16.520> us<00:07:16.610> know<00:07:16.729> what<00:07:16.849> you<00:07:16.940> think<00:07:17.259> go<00:07:18.259> and<00:07:18.409> put<00:07:18.560> up

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
let us know what you think go and put up

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.260 
let us know what you think go and put up
your<00:07:18.680> own<00:07:18.860> and<00:07:19.340> get<00:07:19.699> it<00:07:19.819> going

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
your own and get it going

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.939 
your own and get it going
looks<00:07:21.050> like<00:07:21.169> it's<00:07:21.319> working<00:07:21.590> right<00:07:21.680> now<00:07:21.889> but

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
looks like it's working right now but

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:24.330 
looks like it's working right now but
it'll<00:07:22.729> be<00:07:22.849> a<00:07:22.880> year<00:07:23.180> before<00:07:23.210> we<00:07:23.599> really<00:07:23.900> know

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
it'll be a year before we really know

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.540 
it'll be a year before we really know
it's<00:07:25.340> a<00:07:25.840> success<00:07:26.840> or<00:07:26.990> not<00:07:27.190> but<00:07:28.190> have<00:07:28.340> a<00:07:28.400> good
