00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
bit odor - don't like so I'm gonna play

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.309 
bit odor - don't like so I'm gonna play
out<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:58.909> more<00:01:59.119> but<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.899> is<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.079> first

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
out a little more but this is the first

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.600 
out a little more but this is the first
week<00:02:00.530> I've<00:02:00.679> had<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.950> going<00:02:01.189> it's<00:02:01.340> been<00:02:01.460> really

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610

cold<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:04.399> not<00:02:04.549> warmed<00:02:04.819> up<00:02:04.880> yet<00:02:05.060> to

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
cold and it's not warmed up yet to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.620 
cold and it's not warmed up yet to
expand<00:02:05.539> on<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:06.350> since<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:06.740> I've<00:02:07.520> been<00:02:08.360> really

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
expand on it since so I've been really

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.890 
expand on it since so I've been really
nice

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.850
