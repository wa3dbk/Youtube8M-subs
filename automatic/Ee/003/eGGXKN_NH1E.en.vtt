00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
John Jones still be the champion which

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.189 
John Jones still be the champion which
probably<00:00:33.220> should<00:00:33.670> since<00:00:34.030> its<00:00:34.690> fighting<00:00:34.900> shell

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
probably should since its fighting shell

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.750 
probably should since its fighting shell
son<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.620> not<00:00:35.769> to<00:00:35.890> say<00:00:36.040> Jocelyn<00:00:36.430> doesn't<00:00:36.670> have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.810 
son and not to say Jocelyn doesn't have
a<00:00:36.850> chance<00:00:37.059> he<00:00:37.360> could<00:00:37.570> win<00:00:37.840> but<00:00:38.170> I'm<00:00:38.710> just<00:00:39.040> the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
a chance he could win but I'm just the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.500 
a chance he could win but I'm just the
odds<00:00:40.000> favor<00:00:40.600> Jon<00:00:41.170> Jones<00:00:41.350> obviously<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
odds favor Jon Jones obviously so

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.240 
odds favor Jon Jones obviously so
eventually<00:00:43.780> it's<00:00:44.080> gonna<00:00:44.140> happen<00:00:44.410> but<00:00:44.800> before

eventually it's gonna happen but before

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.920

opponent<00:00:55.450> for<00:00:55.570> him<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.719> think<00:00:56.140> when<00:00:56.680> you<00:00:56.800> think

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.770 
just didn't have a fight form or what
situation<00:01:32.349> but<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.759> fight<00:01:34.060> should<00:01:34.090> probably

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
situation but this fight should probably

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.740 
situation but this fight should probably
take<00:01:35.349> place<00:01:35.860> sometime<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:36.880> spring<00:01:37.149> I<00:01:37.690> would

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
take place sometime this spring I would

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.749 
take place sometime this spring I would
imagine<00:01:38.110> before<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.069> summer<00:01:39.280> time<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.520> would

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
imagine before the summer time I would

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.120 
imagine before the summer time I would
say<00:01:39.910> probably<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.349> don't<00:01:41.560> think<00:01:41.800> it's<00:01:41.920> on

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
say probably and I don't think it's on

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.940 
say probably and I don't think it's on
we<00:01:42.520> don't<00:01:42.610> have<00:01:42.789> an<00:01:42.880> official<00:01:43.590> number<00:01:44.590> for<00:01:44.890> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
we don't have an official number for the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.370 
we don't have an official number for the
UFC<00:01:45.190> yet<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.580> think<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.149> a<00:01:46.179> Fox<00:01:46.569> show<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.170> I

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
UFC yet I think it's on a Fox show but I

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.080 
UFC yet I think it's on a Fox show but I
guess<00:01:47.649> we'll<00:01:47.830> see<00:01:48.009> what<00:01:48.550> happens<00:01:48.880> with<00:01:49.060> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
guess we'll see what happens with that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.400 
guess we'll see what happens with that
so<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.509> haven't<00:01:49.720> heard<00:01:49.929> too<00:01:50.050> many<00:01:50.140> details

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
so I haven't heard too many details

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.620 
so I haven't heard too many details
about<00:01:50.910> exactly<00:01:51.910> what<00:01:52.060> it's<00:01:52.179> supposed<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.569> be

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
about exactly what it's supposed to be

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.749 
about exactly what it's supposed to be

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
maybe there's something on Wikipedia but

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.999 
maybe there's something on Wikipedia but
that's<00:01:54.970> not<00:01:55.179> that's<00:01:55.420> not<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:55.989> know<00:01:56.020> absolute

was I guess the Strikeforce Heavyweight
Champion<00:02:22.629> but<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.709> kind<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.190> different

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
any time pretty much although I don't

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.690 
any time pretty much although I don't
think<00:03:41.709> he's<00:03:41.799> gonna<00:03:41.890> want<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.250> go<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.489> ground

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
think he's gonna want to go the ground

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.520 
think he's gonna want to go the ground
with<00:03:42.790> Frank<00:03:43.060> Mir<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.989> guys<00:03:44.140> remember<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.830 
with Frank Mir if you guys remember the
fight<00:03:44.709> against<00:03:44.950> nog<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.579> don't<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.780> a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
fight against nog I don't think it's a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.390 
fight against nog I don't think it's a
good<00:03:46.959> idea<00:03:47.079> for<00:03:47.320> anybody<00:03:47.650> except<00:03:48.100> for<00:03:48.130> maybe

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
good idea for anybody except for maybe

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.940 
good idea for anybody except for maybe
for<00:03:48.730> doom<00:03:48.940> for<00:03:49.600> doom<00:03:49.810> would<00:03:50.260> probably<00:03:50.680> want<00:03:50.920> to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
for doom for doom would probably want to

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.710 
for doom for doom would probably want to
go<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.250> ground<00:03:51.400> with<00:03:51.579> Mir<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.120> who<00:03:52.570> wins

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
go to the ground with Mir and who wins

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.009 
go to the ground with Mir and who wins
in<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.350> don't<00:03:54.100> know<00:03:54.190> man<00:03:54.510> maybe<00:03:55.510> Virg<00:03:55.900> I

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
in that I don't know man maybe Virg I

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.400 
in that I don't know man maybe Virg I
don't<00:03:56.680> know<00:03:56.769> maybe<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.370> doom<00:03:57.579> but<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:59.200> would

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
don't know maybe for doom but I I would

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.900 
don't know maybe for doom but I I would
count<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.799> as<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> draw<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.400> don't<00:04:00.670> think<00:04:00.820> you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
count that as a draw I don't think you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.520 
count that as a draw I don't think you
can<00:04:01.030> say<00:04:01.269> really<00:04:01.420> once<00:04:01.810> better<00:04:02.109> at<00:04:02.260> Jiu<00:04:02.380> Jitsu

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.969 
that was crazy so you know Frank Mir
definitely<00:04:16.989> can't<00:04:17.169> be<00:04:17.260> counted<00:04:17.560> out<00:04:17.680> when<00:04:17.890> it

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
definitely can't be counted out when it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.909 
definitely can't be counted out when it
comes<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:19.350> pretty<00:04:20.350> much<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.739> would<00:04:20.799> say

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
you could say that Daniel Cormier the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.020 
you could say that Daniel Cormier the
other<00:04:28.150> hand<00:04:28.360> best<00:04:28.570> wrestling<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.889> any<00:04:30.220> mixed

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
because of his Olympic background and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.110 
because of his Olympic background and
you<00:04:35.830> know<00:04:35.950> there's<00:04:36.280> nobody<00:04:36.430> else<00:04:36.789> that<00:04:36.940> we've

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
you know there's nobody else that we've

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.060 
you know there's nobody else that we've
seen<00:04:37.330> that's<00:04:37.570> as<00:04:37.690> good<00:04:37.810> as<00:04:37.960> him<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.350> don't<00:04:38.800> think

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
seen that's as good as him I don't think

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.880 
seen that's as good as him I don't think
so<00:04:39.220> in<00:04:39.400> MMA<00:04:39.849> he<00:04:40.539> might<00:04:40.750> be<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.960> best<00:04:40.990> ever<00:04:41.470> he

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
so in MMA he might be the best ever he

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.260 
so in MMA he might be the best ever he
might<00:04:42.010> be<00:04:42.159> the<00:04:42.280> best<00:04:42.400> wrestler<00:04:42.789> we've<00:04:42.940> ever

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
might be the best wrestler we've ever

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.210 
might be the best wrestler we've ever
seen

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
seen

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.920 
seen
yeah<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.430> think<00:04:45.580> he<00:04:45.850> is<00:04:45.970> actually<00:04:46.210> at<00:04:46.570> least<00:04:46.600> at

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
yeah I think he is actually at least at

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.930 
yeah I think he is actually at least at
the<00:04:47.020> highest<00:04:47.200> level<00:04:47.620> like<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.980> UFC<00:04:48.220> you

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
the highest level like in the UFC you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.610 
the highest level like in the UFC you
know<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.300> those<00:04:49.690> kinds<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.080> bouts<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.470> think

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
know in those kinds of bouts I think

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.990 
know in those kinds of bouts I think
he's<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.830> best<00:04:50.980> Brock<00:04:51.280> Lesnar<00:04:51.640> was<00:04:51.790> really

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
he's the best Brock Lesnar was really

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.060 
he's the best Brock Lesnar was really
good<00:04:52.150> but<00:04:52.330> Daniel<00:04:52.660> Cormier<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.050> just<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.980> know

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
good but Daniel Cormier is just you know

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.930 
good but Daniel Cormier is just you know
another<00:04:54.460> level<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:56.530> being<00:04:56.710> said<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.760> this

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
another level so that being said in this

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.550 
another level so that being said in this
fight<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:59.080> is<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.230> pretty<00:04:59.380> tough

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
fight and this is this is a pretty tough

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.130 
fight and this is this is a pretty tough
one<00:04:59.740> but<00:04:59.920> I'm<00:05:00.070> gonna<00:05:00.220> go<00:05:00.400> with<00:05:00.430> for<00:05:00.760> me<00:05:01.140> even

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
one but I'm gonna go with for me even

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.930 
one but I'm gonna go with for me even
though<00:05:02.290> Frank<00:05:02.620> Mir<00:05:02.800> could<00:05:03.040> slap<00:05:03.310> on<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> really

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
though Frank Mir could slap on a really

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.850 
though Frank Mir could slap on a really
good<00:05:04.060> submission<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:04.810> think<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:05.620> just<00:05:05.710> gonna

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
good submission I think it's just gonna

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.290 
good submission I think it's just gonna
be<00:05:06.100> it's<00:05:06.370> gonna<00:05:06.460> be<00:05:06.580> really<00:05:06.760> tough<00:05:06.970> for<00:05:07.210> him

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
be it's gonna be really tough for him

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.190 
be it's gonna be really tough for him
cuz<00:05:07.420> he's<00:05:07.540> not<00:05:07.660> gonna<00:05:07.840> be<00:05:07.930> able<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.080> take

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
cuz he's not gonna be able to take

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.260 
cuz he's not gonna be able to take
Cormier<00:05:08.560> down<00:05:08.770> he's<00:05:09.280> gonna<00:05:09.400> get<00:05:09.640> rag<00:05:09.880> dolls<00:05:10.150> a

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
Cormier down he's gonna get rag dolls a

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.820 
Cormier down he's gonna get rag dolls a
lot<00:05:10.300> probably<00:05:10.750> thrown<00:05:11.290> around<00:05:11.410> quite<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:11.740> bit

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
lot probably thrown around quite a bit

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.460 
lot probably thrown around quite a bit
and<00:05:12.210> at<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.300> same<00:05:13.480> time<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:14.050> don't<00:05:14.110> really

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
and at the same time I don't really

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.590 
and at the same time I don't really
think<00:05:14.530> Frank<00:05:15.070> mirrors<00:05:15.400> gonna<00:05:15.910> have<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.360> big

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
think Frank mirrors gonna have that big

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.420 
think Frank mirrors gonna have that big
advantage<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.260> striking<00:05:17.800> I<00:05:17.950> mean<00:05:18.100> Daniel

Cormier<00:05:18.760> is<00:05:18.850> striking<00:05:19.330> is<00:05:19.450> very<00:05:19.920> underrated

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
Cormier is striking is very underrated

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.300 
Cormier is striking is very underrated
and<00:05:21.310> very<00:05:21.520> good<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.850> mean<00:05:22.500> training<00:05:23.500> with<00:05:23.650> Kane

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
and very good I mean training with Kane

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.510 
and very good I mean training with Kane
obviously<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:26.020> know<00:05:26.170> it's<00:05:27.040> it's

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
obviously you know it's it's

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.370 
obviously you know it's it's
unpredictable<00:05:28.510> what<00:05:28.630> he's<00:05:28.750> gonna<00:05:28.900> do<00:05:29.140> he

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
unpredictable what he's gonna do he

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.800 
unpredictable what he's gonna do he
mixes<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.890> in<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.550> know<00:05:30.640> he's<00:05:30.820> yeah<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.480> think

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
mixes it in you know he's yeah I think

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
mixes it in you know he's yeah I think
he's<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:31.960> really<00:05:32.110> tough<00:05:32.350> fight<00:05:32.380> for<00:05:32.710> almost

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
he's a really tough fight for almost

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.620 
he's a really tough fight for almost
anybody<00:05:33.160> never<00:05:33.550> may<00:05:33.760> right<00:05:34.000> now<00:05:34.210> be<00:05:34.420> it<00:05:34.510> a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
anybody never may right now be it a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.030 
anybody never may right now be it a
heavyweight<00:05:34.900> or<00:05:35.170> rather<00:05:35.260> maybe<00:05:35.560> Alistair

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
heavyweight or rather maybe Alistair

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.560 
heavyweight or rather maybe Alistair
Overeem<00:05:36.400> could<00:05:36.640> crush<00:05:36.880> him<00:05:36.910> just<00:05:37.419> with<00:05:37.510> a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
Overeem could crush him just with a

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.670 
Overeem could crush him just with a
stand-up<00:05:38.050> but<00:05:38.830> nobody's<00:05:39.490> gonna<00:05:39.669> wrestle<00:05:40.060> them

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
stand-up but nobody's gonna wrestle them

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.190 
stand-up but nobody's gonna wrestle them
basically<00:05:41.680> nobody<00:05:42.480> so<00:05:43.480> unless<00:05:43.720> they<00:05:43.900> can<00:05:43.960> beat

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
basically nobody so unless they can beat

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.920 
basically nobody so unless they can beat
him<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.500> striking<00:05:45.000> isn't<00:05:46.000> really<00:05:46.570> tough<00:05:46.780> for

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
him and striking isn't really tough for

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.470 
him and striking isn't really tough for
people<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.290> do<00:05:47.470> it<00:05:47.590> because<00:05:48.490> again<00:05:48.730> if<00:05:49.180> he<00:05:49.300> gets

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
people to do it because again if he gets

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.850 
people to do it because again if he gets
in<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.660> scramble<00:05:50.140> with<00:05:50.200> me<00:05:50.470> or<00:05:50.590> he'll<00:05:50.710> just
