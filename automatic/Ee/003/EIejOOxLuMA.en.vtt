00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello guys if right now me 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.879
 you are going to write comments but there is not 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 giulia in this video 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.950
 welcome to our captain channel 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 obvious 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.910
 true ayew 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.180
 premise there is no giulia in this video 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.920
 because you will have noticed that he has some 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.870
 that we are not making videos 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 we are having a hard time seeing each other 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.820
 for personal problems and for a matter of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.460
 university and let alone make videos 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.290
 so I made this video by myself 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.970
 taking advantage of the fact that giulia so much 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.100
 could not have talked why not 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.559
 there was a visit to Lucca to tell him 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.500
 just write us on the bulletin board when you do 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.780
 we don't know the next video 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.840
 in planning and video but we do n't know 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.400
 when we can make them a girl has me 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.470
 written by checa , since i didn't 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.540
 it will be luca comics you could talk in 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.430
 next video so I thought about doing 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 this video divided into two parts 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.790
 before where i talk to you how to deal 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 lucca comics 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.330
 if the first time you go and the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.180
 second, I'll tell you about mine 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.009
 lucca comics experience this year 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.570
 then if the first time she went to 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.979
 lucca comics there are three things 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.550
 fundamental 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.509
 japan palace concerts and events 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.060
 and the japan palace games pavilion is 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.009
 the only part dedicated to the stands that you are 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.590
 located inside a building is 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.929
 really beautiful because they are not there 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.360
 only the normal collection stands 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.610
 figures but there are also stands that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 therefore they come from abroad to find gods 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.220
 gadgets that you usually won't find there 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.740
 the part dedicated to real Japan e 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.390
 just where they sell kimonos and others 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.000
 things about oriental culture 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 real on the second floor there is one 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.160
 part dedicated to designers and make us 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.830
 various congresses and there is also a restaurant 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.959
 Japanese is not that they make sushi but 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.259
 they make their own Japanese cuisine 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.630
 concerts and events before you go 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 at lucca comics you have to go to the site e 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.170
 mark what the events are 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.599
 may be of interest because they are 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.670
 really myriad this year for 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.170
 example there was the giorgio concert 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.780
 vanni that of the gem boys 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 then there was the meeting with stolen that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 you could even have it 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.200
 an autograph from him etc. year 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.800
 last at the games pavilion instead 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.100
 there were Harry's weasley twins 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.600
 potter are really so many in the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.130
 things then before going down there 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.660
 agrees by teaching her all those who 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.790
 they may interest you because they are 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.280
 those that make the difference 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.430
 the games pavilion then I like 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.610
 in video games but the first few times 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.230
 I went to Lucca human comics go into 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.840
 speed or just had nothing to do with 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.820
 pavilion games great mistake is 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.680
 perhaps the most beautiful pavilion and games 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.750
 there is the part dedicated to online games 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 there is a part dedicated to the games of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.000
 cards, the moment they throw you 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 wearing gadgets that divert points 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.200
 to try to get one e 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 they advertise many new games 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.510
 that I went out over to buy i 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.710
 games at a good price 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.470
 this friend gave it to me in 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.090
 this year's pavilions and this is it 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.260
 what you need to know before you go 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.060
 to lucca comics 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.680
 they hadn't told me and the first few times 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.410
 to one I understood why it was so 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.180
 exceptional as fair is ok there are gods 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.940
 really spectacular ridges and it is 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.680
 an opportunity to meet with kind people 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.050
 he comes from the other side of Italy and if 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.360
 it wasn't exactly downtown 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.980
 but it is these three things that are 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.500
 really make you appreciate the lucca 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.320
 comics my experience of luca 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.600
 First year you all 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.610
 those who said it would be 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.920
 come down the world would be united 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.320
 hail snow ruby meteorites 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.230
 etc. because he has approached one more 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.270
 couple of times and the Sunday they have 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.920
 announced the universal flood 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.900
 it only rained in the morning at 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.110
 early and evening around eight in the evening 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.850
 so nobody was there and I got myself 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.130
 enjoyed Sunday for the first time in 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.140
 my life although I was sorry that 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.510
 if the flood had not been announced 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.350
 I did cosplay it and it will be for another 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.440
 once a fantastic thing happened 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.740
 This year 's adventure times cosplay 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.360
 they replaced naruto and cosplay 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.480
 those of one piece instead were 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.940
 replaced by and italy of the gers was 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.010
 a little man like what I wouldn't be 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.890
 waited I follow adventure time up 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.419
 boing for a while but I do not understand 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.000
 why he took all this foot 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.650
 among the emergency cosplay instead in the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.450
 most of those taken from the film 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.300
 there are a couple that are also taken 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.270
 by the comics by if we say that 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.090
 they do against those that are based 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.700
 only on the film and so on 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.710
 the most spectacular thing this year is 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.960
 been the gem boy I really am 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.120
 enjoyed and this video concert of the gems 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.010
 boy more than anything else because not only the 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.470
 songs by itself alfano wants to laugh 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.080
 but a color of more intermezzos than they do 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.430
 between one song and another in other words 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.860
 if you didn't come to Lucca this year 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.110
 you are losers and I tell you this for the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.990
