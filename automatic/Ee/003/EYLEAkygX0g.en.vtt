00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.690
 how do you see the match against ponferradina 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:08.490
 I imagine that you want to win after 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.710
 I could not do it in Guadalajara 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.910
 they're easy 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.910
 very important with us 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.620
 it's late 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.119
 and the truth is that after 51 the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.310
 sabadell I have set the bar very high 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.710
 not to repeat an equal match is going to be 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.300
 difficult for you will have to try 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.300
 it is difficult but not impossible 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.520
 I can not pass 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.760
 let's go out as always 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.800
 to win 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.039
 it gives the feeling jonathan that when 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.129
 you have spaces you can with speed with 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.129
 fire do a lot of damage but when they 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.229
 they have lines of 4 or 5 players when 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.399
 you do not have spaces is resulting more 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.399
 difficult as in Guadalajara 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.500
 you have a field 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.750
 to play but here we have a field 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.150
 very well with space with everything and good 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.260
 I think it's not going to have much 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 problem 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.190
 well I imagine that the personal 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 happy javi grace is counting 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.760
 with you and you are answering because 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.760
 you are having performance 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 they are doing what 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.220
 you want me to do the mister 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 with laser 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.260
 I have to keep working and salt 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.240
 in dead 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.600
 colleagues have been congratulated for the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.600
 tests 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.650
 as physics has not sent more 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.180
 the next break very well 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.640
 I is not in the subsidiary francisco 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.590
 I played as a center forward 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 now you are more in band you where are you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.590
 more comfortable brotherhood where beats what 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.590
 jonathan that demarcation 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.790
 on all sides by wiping why 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.710
 The front 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.370
 little by little he listened to me in the band 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.260
 with your command why 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.980
 always very fast and what power 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.980
 contribute more there 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.060
 I'm going to play there 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.750
 and a cup in front again before 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.510
 you played in the second parts and now 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.150
 the owner that will have given you confidence 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.720
 you will not be very happy not the mister 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.720
 trust in you 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.970
 we are going to have more time to be able 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.880
 play football and gain confidence to be 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.590
 jong and xabi grace the coach that more 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.590
 influences your career 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.910
 many trained and now we go as 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.910
 growing 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.970
 s 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.350
 they have given me the opportunity do not feel 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.580
 very good 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.580
 but that I have to continue like this for 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.360
 here we met you with jonathan but in 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.010
 all of spain 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.660
 the fashionable man of the second is you 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.660
 I explain that you prefer 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.600
 and so you know me where I'm from 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.600
 because yes 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.860
 in Burkina which player is posted 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.510
 as reference 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.110
 this applied 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.799
 worldwide were increasing 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.660
 the players alone tell me it's like 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.660
 the quick touch you can take advantage 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.260
 continuing with that apart from this you 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.120
 identifies for example the work in 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.950
 almería like the one that pedrito can do 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.810
 in Barcelona by speed per 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.810
 delivery for fight for tourism 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.000
 party plants 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.190
 but he's going to find me 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.840
 you want me but you are 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.390
 of cooking yes yes of how it is 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.050
 of everything 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.400
 you wrap up is that they tell me that the same 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.330
 I prefer by game to the band that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.330
 forward of pains 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:03.539
 in the band how are you seeing the 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:06.189
 competition and because it seems to be missing 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.199
 23 wins in a row so we can 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.849
 approach the elche not because we continue 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.020
 having teams that are behind 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:16.660
 we are very close 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.660
 is what we are showing everything why 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.240
 one more space to be sure 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.160
 to the three matches in a row 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.290
 although it is not easy but 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.980
 we will try we will give everything to 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.680
 get it is very important the almeria 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.970
 has two pearls of nigeria's finances 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.570
 last final of the Africa Cup 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.440
 you had a mess about ramón attitude in that 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.830
 moment 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.110
 I've lost it but for me 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.139
 we were not there to play the final 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.349
 the resident said it but 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.479
 you are going to play the first round you pass 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:02.330
 that back nothing happens is the first 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.749
 Once the next brings them the cup 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.789
 better to play until the end but already 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.970
 we were running though the next 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:15.660
 we will be able to win it 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.390
 I wish where you see before at first with 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.560
 the almería a selection that is what 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.560
 more illusion quality 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.250
 the selection is very important 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.170
 in the selection 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.390
 we have to do well here through 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.670
 those looks in the new slags 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.340
 series here 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:42.530
 let's count on 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:45.530
 a nickname because to play to mean 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.530
 designed
