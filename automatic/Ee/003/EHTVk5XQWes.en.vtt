Disney 3-6-5

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:08.539
Hey everyone, with all the info of all things Disney

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:11.208
365 days a year, I'm Regina.

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:13.723
in the middle of Iowa where everyone in Mrs. Schnedler's 

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:15.534
6th grade class and the rest of the school. 

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.751
is about to find out that they just won

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.620
Disney's Planet Challenge!

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:23.521
Mrs. Schnedler, students, you guys are the Grand 

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.960
Prize Winners of the 2010 Disney Planet Challenge!

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:29.263
(Crowd Cheers) Disney's Planet Challenge is a nationwide competiton. 

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.008
 Where 4th, 5th and 6th graders get to team up and help create

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:33.508
 projects about helping the environment!

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.508
These 6th grader's winning project was called Operation Save the Quails! 

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.037
Why is operation Save the Quail so important?

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.840
Because the quail in our area are suffering and they don't have any habitat. 

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.930
so we tried to rebuild the habitat and make it strong and healthy.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.080
Most of Iowa used to be prairie where the quail live and now

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
basically none of it is prairie. 

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.030
And you're probably wondering what they won. How about 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.258
a grand prize three day trip to

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.627
Disneyland Resort in California! 

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.263
 Where they get to meet Jason Dolly from Good Luck Charlie 

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:05.082
and Chelsey Staub from Jonas L.A.  

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:07.367
Hey you guys!

00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:12.707
Mrs. Julie Schnedler and her grand prize winning 6th grade class.   

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.616
(Crowd Cheers) Congratulations! 

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:17.678
Okay, so how do you guys think this Disney's Planet Challenge classroom 

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:21.678
 can inspire everyone participating in Disney's friends for change?

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.519
I think this is really amazing that these kids really took the inititave

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.887
and got this project together.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.305
How can one class make a difference?

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:31.050
I think this is the perfect example of the one class that can make a  difference.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.050
These are just kids that had the passion and the drive

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.795
to make a change for their environment and I think 

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:36.997
this sends a great message across America.   

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.592
