00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.370 
to where it hits something so I'm going
to<00:02:20.730> try<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> slide<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:21.690> up<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> shaft

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
to try to slide it back up on the shaft

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.000 
to try to slide it back up on the shaft
there<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.820> then<00:02:24.060> see<00:02:24.960> if<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.170> functions

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
there and then see if it's functions

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
there and then see if it's functions
okay<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.850> if<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.420> does<00:02:27.570> then<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.960> just

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
okay and if it does then we can just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.620 
okay and if it does then we can just
have<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.320> customer<00:02:28.650> monitor<00:02:29.270> I'm<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.450> going

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
have the customer monitor I'm just going

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.670 
have the customer monitor I'm just going
to<00:02:30.660> go<00:02:30.840> ahead<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.080> try<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.230> use<00:02:31.470> my

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to go ahead and try to use my

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.240 
to go ahead and try to use my
screwdriver<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.600> basically<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.980> pry<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.010> up

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
screwdriver and basically just pry it up

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.300 
screwdriver and basically just pry it up
you've<00:02:36.150> gone<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> little<00:02:36.660> too<00:02:36.780> dry<00:02:36.990> there<00:02:37.310> all

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you've gone a little too dry there all
