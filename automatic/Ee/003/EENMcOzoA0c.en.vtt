00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
vehicles of course the downside is that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
vehicles of course the downside is that
you<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.240> also<00:01:39.450> die<00:01:39.810> alongside<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.409> vehicle

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.429 
do non the less simply got beside a car
then<00:01:45.149> bash<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> window<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> run<00:01:46.110> three<00:01:46.290> to

then bash the window when I run three to
four<00:01:46.590> times<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> will<00:01:47.250> blow<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
four times and it will blow up in a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.389 
four times and it will blow up in a
matter<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> seconds<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.829> upside<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
matter of seconds now the upside to this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
matter of seconds now the upside to this
this<00:01:50.700> may<00:01:50.909> also<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.600> an<00:01:51.780> anti-tank<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this may also be an anti-tank kind of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
this may also be an anti-tank kind of
way<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> blow<00:01:53.939> them<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.899> not

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
way to blow them up because I'm not

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.420 
way to blow them up because I'm not
entirely<00:01:55.259> sure<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.920> work<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.250> tanks

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
entirely sure if this will work on tanks

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
entirely sure if this will work on tanks
but<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> presume<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.509> Abba<00:01:58.079> Jim<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> might

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
but I presume it well Abba Jim it might

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
but I presume it well Abba Jim it might
take<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> few<00:01:58.799> more<00:01:59.100> tries<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.610> blow

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
take a few more tries to actually blow

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
take a few more tries to actually blow
it<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.049> guys<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.350> time<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.619> the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
get your hands on a Titan these were one

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.440 
get your hands on a Titan these were one
hundred<00:04:38.250> percent<00:04:38.460> support<00:04:38.850> on<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.240> airfield

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
hundred percent support on the airfield

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.690 
hundred percent support on the airfield

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
they will always spawn inside of the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
is get inside of the Titan then simply

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.060 
is get inside of the Titan then simply
flow<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.880> Titan<00:04:48.270> out<00:04:48.450> of<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.870> hangar<00:04:49.080> just<00:04:49.920> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
flow the Titan out of the hangar just a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.290 
flow the Titan out of the hangar just a
little<00:04:50.250> bit<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.610> then<00:04:50.670> when<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:50.940> guys<00:04:51.060> are<00:04:51.240> a

good distance out you don't want to get
out<00:04:53.400> of<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.760> Titan<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.330> then<00:04:54.480> blow<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:55.080> in

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
out of the Titan and then blow it up in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.320

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
to go into passive mode because when

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.450 
to go into passive mode because when
your<00:06:28.020> friend<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.410> in<00:06:28.470> passive<00:06:29.010> mode<00:06:29.040> these

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
your friend is in passive mode these

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.130 
your friend is in passive mode these
sticky<00:06:29.730> bombs<00:06:29.970> will<00:06:30.240> still<00:06:30.480> be<00:06:30.600> on<00:06:30.720> his<00:06:30.930> back

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
doesn't have passive mode on then of

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.970 
doesn't have passive mode on then of
course<00:06:44.390> he<00:06:44.750> will<00:06:44.930> die<00:06:45.110> when<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.440> do<00:06:45.590> detonate

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
friend here does have passive mode

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.130 
friend here does have passive mode
enabled<00:06:50.090> and<00:06:50.270> when<00:06:50.360> I<00:06:50.390> act<00:06:50.660> when<00:06:50.900> I<00:06:50.930> actually

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
enabled and when I act when I actually

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.500 
enabled and when I act when I actually
set<00:06:51.740> the<00:06:51.800> bombs<00:06:52.010> off<00:06:52.250> as<00:06:52.460> you<00:06:52.970> can<00:06:53.120> see<00:06:53.270> there

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
standing next to him so these glitches

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.300 
standing next to him so these glitches
are<00:06:57.050> absolutely<00:06:57.530> awesome<00:06:57.680> once<00:06:57.980> again<00:06:58.190> it's

something called online that maybe you
haven't<00:07:08.930> seen<00:07:09.230> before<00:07:09.380> or<00:07:09.680> maybe<00:07:09.860> that<00:07:10.040> you've

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
forgotten as you can see that glitch is

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.420 
forgotten as you can see that glitch is
very<00:07:12.290> easy<00:07:12.500> to<00:07:12.740> do<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:12.890> can<00:07:13.130> take<00:07:13.280> advantage

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
very easy to do you can take advantage

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.130 
very easy to do you can take advantage
of<00:07:13.910> that<00:07:13.970> in<00:07:14.210> so<00:07:14.480> many<00:07:14.630> different<00:07:14.840> situations

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
of that in so many different situations

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.350 
of that in so many different situations
maybe<00:07:15.830> if<00:07:15.980> there's<00:07:16.160> a<00:07:16.220> tank<00:07:16.490> or<00:07:16.910> a<00:07:16.970> group<00:07:17.210> of

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
maybe if there's a tank or a group of

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.670 
maybe if there's a tank or a group of
people<00:07:17.540> one<00:07:17.900> of<00:07:17.990> your<00:07:18.080> friends<00:07:18.320> could<00:07:18.440> go<00:07:18.560> into

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
people one of your friends could go into

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.470 
people one of your friends could go into
passive<00:07:19.130> mode<00:07:19.340> while<00:07:19.790> you<00:07:19.910> have<00:07:19.940> these<00:07:20.150> sticky

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 
passive mode while you have these sticky

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.240 
passive mode while you have these sticky
bumps<00:07:20.630> on<00:07:20.840> his<00:07:21.020> back<00:07:21.350> now<00:07:21.620> you<00:07:21.680> cannot<00:07:22.040> throw

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
bumps on his back now you cannot throw

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.460 
bumps on his back now you cannot throw
the<00:07:22.310> sticky<00:07:22.640> bumps<00:07:22.790> on<00:07:23.000> his<00:07:23.180> back<00:07:23.450> while<00:07:24.140> he's

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
the sticky bumps on his back while he's

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.500 
the sticky bumps on his back while he's
in<00:07:24.710> passive<00:07:25.070> mode<00:07:25.100> so<00:07:25.460> to<00:07:25.520> do<00:07:25.760> this<00:07:25.880> he<00:07:26.390> would

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
in passive mode so to do this he would

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.000 
in passive mode so to do this he would
have<00:07:26.660> to<00:07:26.810> be<00:07:26.900> out<00:07:27.110> of<00:07:27.140> passive<00:07:27.680> mode<00:07:27.800> first

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
have to be out of passive mode first

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.620 
have to be out of passive mode first
then<00:07:28.520> you<00:07:28.610> for<00:07:28.760> the<00:07:28.850> sticky<00:07:29.060> bumps<00:07:29.240> on<00:07:29.420> his

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
then you for the sticky bumps on his

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.570 
then you for the sticky bumps on his
back<00:07:29.900> and<00:07:30.110> then<00:07:30.590> of<00:07:30.680> course<00:07:30.710> then<00:07:31.250> he<00:07:31.460> can

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
back and then of course then he can

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.670 
back and then of course then he can
enter<00:07:31.880> passive<00:07:32.240> mode<00:07:32.480> and<00:07:32.750> my<00:07:33.230> guys<00:07:33.410> that<00:07:33.590> is

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
enter passive mode and my guys that is

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.990 
enter passive mode and my guys that is
pretty<00:07:33.830> much<00:07:33.980> it<00:07:34.040> for<00:07:34.160> the<00:07:34.310> compilation<00:07:34.850> once

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000
