then I get the Hoffman perfect Hoffman
the<00:04:35.900> scales<00:04:36.259> are<00:04:36.500> different<00:04:36.949> you<00:04:37.069> see<00:04:37.220> our

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
the scales are different you see our

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.140 
the scales are different you see our
Marcus<00:04:37.669> Fenix<00:04:37.789> is<00:04:38.090> bulkier<00:04:38.830> then<00:04:39.830> Hoffman<00:04:40.250> and

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
Marcus Fenix is bulkier then Hoffman and

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.570 
Marcus Fenix is bulkier then Hoffman and
also<00:04:41.479> obviously<00:04:41.720> you've<00:04:41.930> got<00:04:42.139> the<00:04:42.259> legs<00:04:42.580> now

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
also obviously you've got the legs now

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.129 
also obviously you've got the legs now
with<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.819> legs<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.180> legs<00:04:44.389> are<00:04:44.659> you<00:04:45.020> know

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
with the legs the legs are you know

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.689 
with the legs the legs are you know
practically<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.710> same<00:04:45.889> but<00:04:46.129> hoping<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.460> paint

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
practically the same but hoping to paint

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.820 
practically the same but hoping to paint
it<00:04:46.879> differently<00:04:47.240> their<00:04:48.050> belts<00:04:48.379> are<00:04:48.500> different

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
it differently their belts are different

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.740 
it differently their belts are different
so<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:49.520> look<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.729> you<00:04:49.849> see<00:04:50.030> Marcus<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.479> built

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
so you look if you see Marcus is built

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.529 
so you look if you see Marcus is built
and<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.710> see<00:04:51.830> Hoffman's<00:04:52.220> built<00:04:52.539> the

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
and then you see Hoffman's built the

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.610 
and then you see Hoffman's built the
crutch<00:04:53.889> pattern<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:55.039> different<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:57.500> the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
crutch pattern is different so the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.589 
crutch pattern is different so the
crotch<00:04:57.800> pattern<00:04:58.129> is<00:04:58.250> different<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.789> shoulder

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
crotch pattern is different a shoulder

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.990 
crotch pattern is different a shoulder
pads<00:05:00.190> marks<00:05:01.190> has<00:05:01.310> got<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> shoulder<00:05:01.669> pads

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
pads marks has got the shoulder pads

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.230 
pads marks has got the shoulder pads
where<00:05:02.210> hoffman<00:05:02.659> doesn't<00:05:03.699> see<00:05:04.699> if<00:05:04.879> i<00:05:04.940> turn<00:05:05.000> it

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
where hoffman doesn't see if i turn it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.459 
where hoffman doesn't see if i turn it
round<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.509> can<00:05:05.629> see<00:05:05.900> better<00:05:06.050> way<00:05:06.259> i'll<00:05:06.349> turn

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
round you can see better way i'll turn
