do<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.560> vehicles<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.520> growing<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
do you see vehicles like this growing in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
do you see vehicles like this growing in
popularity<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> more<00:01:16.860> interest<00:01:17.400> in

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
popularity with the more interest in

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
popularity with the more interest in
fuel<00:01:18.030> economy<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> turbo

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
fuel economy so that with the turbo

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.980 
fuel economy so that with the turbo
charging<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> fuel<00:01:21.270> economy<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
charging you get the fuel economy but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
charging you get the fuel economy but
still<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> power<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> people

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
still get some of the power that people

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.920 
still get some of the power that people
are<00:01:23.490> looking<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.210> think<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.780> think

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
are looking for we think so we think

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
are looking for we think so we think
that<00:01:25.049> turbo<00:01:25.439> charging<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that turbo charging is going to be a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.630 
that turbo charging is going to be a
good<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.720> those<00:01:28.340> enthusiasts<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> get

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
good way for those enthusiasts to get

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
good way for those enthusiasts to get
driving<00:01:30.030> excitement<00:01:30.390> while<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.530> getting

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
good fuel economy for instance this

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.210 
good fuel economy for instance this
vehicle<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:33.990> gets<00:01:34.200> 25<00:01:34.619> miles<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> gallon

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
