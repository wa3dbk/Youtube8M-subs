it's<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.479> good

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it's I think this is a really good

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's I think this is a really good
addition<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.619> town<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.790> little

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
addition to my town just this little

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
addition to my town just this little
whacking<00:01:54.570> day<00:01:54.720> street<00:01:55.200> corner<00:01:55.590> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.009> thing

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
whacking day street corner kind of thing

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.499 
whacking day street corner kind of thing
a<00:01:57.060> market<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.020> guess<00:01:58.259> little<00:01:59.100> farmers<00:02:00.060> market<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a market I guess little farmers market I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.780 
a market I guess little farmers market I
guess<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.049> sells<00:02:01.320> bets<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.979> t-shirts<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
guess that sells bets and t-shirts and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.440 
guess that sells bets and t-shirts and
junk<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:04.880> think<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.000> pretty<00:02:06.119> cool

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
junk and I think it's pretty cool

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.680 
junk and I think it's pretty cool
because<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.500> built<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.160> little<00:02:08.580> tense<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
because I have built a little tense and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
towards the angle of our town but I just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.490 
towards the angle of our town but I just
made<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.160> they<00:02:21.280> look<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.610> they're<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
made them so they look like they're you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.770 
made them so they look like they're you
know<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.760> know<00:02:24.850> how<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.030> would<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.660> know

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
know you know how it would be you know

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780 
know you know how it would be you know
in<00:02:25.900> real<00:02:26.050> life<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.010> that's<00:02:27.430> where<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
in real life so that's that's where I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.880 
in real life so that's that's where I
like<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.540> probably<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.990> lot<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.500> I

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
like that it's probably like a lot and I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.170 
like that it's probably like a lot and I
just<00:02:30.100> made<00:02:30.220> them<00:02:30.310> blocked<00:02:30.550> out<00:02:30.700> by<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> tree

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
just made them blocked out by the tree

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540 
just made them blocked out by the tree
so<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.140> actually<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.560> my<00:02:32.860> favorite

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.130 
so this is actually one of my favorite
things<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.880> I've<00:02:33.970> added<00:02:34.120> into<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.569> town<00:02:34.630> so

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
fine where it was because honestly the

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.580 
like it gives you enough detail to
but<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.060> don't<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.330> need<00:04:28.569> much<00:04:28.840> around<00:04:29.380> it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
but you don't really need much around it

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.980 
but you don't really need much around it
but<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.190> mean<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.759> made<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.360> look<00:04:31.509> pretty<00:04:31.750> good

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
but I mean I made it look pretty good

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.600 
but I mean I made it look pretty good
and<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.199> was<00:04:32.289> fine<00:04:32.470> before<00:04:32.740> where<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.220> was<00:04:33.370> up

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
and it was fine before where it was up

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
and it was fine before where it was up
over<00:04:33.759> in<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> corner<00:04:34.330> over<00:04:34.449> there<00:04:34.720> but<00:04:35.560> it's

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
over in the corner over there but it's

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.400 
over in the corner over there but it's
it's<00:04:36.370> pretty<00:04:36.669> good<00:04:36.819> where<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> was<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.720> still

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
it's pretty good where it was so I still

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.080 
it's pretty good where it was so I still
gotta<00:04:38.560> fill<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.009> couple<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.340> spots<00:04:39.699> with

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
gotta fill in a couple of spots with

gotta fill in a couple of spots with
stuff<00:04:40.330> i<00:04:40.509> think<00:04:40.690> i<00:04:40.750> might<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.080> save<00:04:41.289> those

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
stuff i think i might just save those

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.980 
stuff i think i might just save those
spots<00:04:41.800> until<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.789> next<00:04:43.000> update<00:04:43.210> but<00:04:43.599> honestly

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
spots until the next update but honestly

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.659 
spots until the next update but honestly
they<00:04:44.229> really<00:04:44.500> better<00:04:44.680> make<00:04:44.949> more<00:04:45.190> land<00:04:45.430> or

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669
