I<00:00:05.549> have<00:00:06.549> a<00:00:06.640> theory<00:00:07.090> that<00:00:07.270> there<00:00:07.630> is<00:00:07.689> always

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
I have a theory that there is always

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.490 
I have a theory that there is always
going<00:00:08.050> to<00:00:08.080> be<00:00:08.170> somebody<00:00:08.559> to<00:00:08.590> care<00:00:08.889> for<00:00:09.100> you

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
somebody to look out for you so far the

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.410 
somebody to look out for you so far the
theories<00:00:17.950> not<00:00:18.099> too<00:00:18.250> bright

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.890 

I<00:00:23.480> try<00:00:24.470> best<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:25.040> think<00:00:25.250> about<00:00:25.550> happy<00:00:26.300> memories

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
of better times but it gets harder each

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.570 
of better times but it gets harder each
day<00:00:34.550> as<00:00:34.730> society<00:00:35.210> looks<00:00:35.420> down<00:00:35.750> on<00:00:36.020> us

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:49.069 
day as society looks down on us
sometimes<00:00:37.580> just<00:00:37.880> ignores<00:00:38.210> us<00:00:38.480> or<00:00:38.660> hides<00:00:38.870> us

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.669 

I'm<00:00:50.039> always<00:00:50.249> looking<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.879> job<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.960> hopes

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.890 

and<00:01:03.880> just<00:01:04.880> when<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.120> think<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.870> have

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
and just when you think you have

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.890 
and just when you think you have
everything<00:01:06.530> figured<00:01:06.740> out<00:01:07.570> that<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.720> might

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
everything figured out that you might

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.470 
everything figured out that you might
take<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.110> turn<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.650> better<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.240> think

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
take a turn for the better and you think

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.620 
take a turn for the better and you think
that<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:12.140> might<00:01:12.710> get<00:01:12.980> off<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.280> streets

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:42.050 --> 00:02:08.919 

my<00:01:43.050> latest<00:01:43.290> theory<00:01:43.940> isn't<00:01:44.940> working
