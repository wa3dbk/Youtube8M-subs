 theme so it's called oriental is 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.240
 good in the past 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.340
 in the past we were playing in one 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.229
 which is 2 against 2 and we won the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.880
 split and the audio was cut all the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.990
 time horribly they leave a paper and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.810
 start fucking money to pay to see 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.050
 I write to you 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.480
 the fingers 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.760
 here where the joke consists of 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.360
 ladies we are three in the yellow we are 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.360
 abandonment 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.660
 let's do this I tell them the last one is 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.370
 I heard the horrible microphone because 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.350
 it was software problem it was not me 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.650
 I swear it was not me, it was a problem 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.650
 software 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.020
 we are still not going to get there 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.270
 but let's go fast 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.280
 at the beginning it was hard for me to do a good job 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.590
 do this but thank god I have a 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.420
 mouse that has macros and on the mouse 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.460
 marc gasol because I swear that with the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 keyboard crouching and it's impossible 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.290
 and more impossible to bend over with the keyboard 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.209
 it's too much 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 I hope you want to apply it 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.500
 without applying I think they are friends I do not know 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.810
 they carry our little egg still not 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.410
 well I hope you discover it cover 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.890
 our website or something like that because if it's not going to 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:19.280
 to pass something bad to see we go we go very 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.280
 fast through the market halfway 4444 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.430
 4 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.349
 in to get the other two 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:49.290
 it's not my good guy at least my team 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.970
 He did as he called himself and he did 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.500
 covered the egg not least if they wanted 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.290
 come develop is already covered to 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.690
 our egg but woe to me is that as 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.310
 everything was for that reason where but without 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.130
 yolanda mari carmen without violating the sea ​​and 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.260
 coal then I'm going to have richard 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.790
 is not the one that is not going to want to kill 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.989
 our 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.590
 it comes very well is good but not 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.590
 they can go very well 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:20.519
 the referee did not destroy my egg is not 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.949
 to speak black we are not going to give you another 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.310
 because today at first there was the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.980
 that means you end spending half the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.840
 extreme spending 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.900
 and I can not believe it to see 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.150
 this was this wey that came to me already brings 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.970
 all this wey brings his armor and his 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.970
 stone sword down 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.940
 and here I have 5 papaya with this I 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.230
 I'm going to go at the moment because I do not want 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.000
 throw it 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.190
 I do not want to repeat it so I'm leaving 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.720
 I'm going for 9 because I already have the 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.720
 diamond and gasset there is montt 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.270
 there are cuts 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.730
 well I do not know I do not know if I bleed with 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.310
 true but first speak in gringolandia 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.470
 so I hope that the minimum güeyes already 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.230
 know or the majority knows how to speak gringo 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.100
 them so let's call it gringo les la 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.620
 most know how to speak kirin goals so 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.570
 I guess the guys know that it's something 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.000
 of demon's does not mean I have the 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.000
 boy flames then well 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.050
 I'm going to apply the lethal attack on the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.050
 attack 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.050
 5 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.120
 and I said you know he is right for 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.430
 you have a lot of reason 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.910
 so we must apply it as a doctor to 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.560
 qualcomm I think with good gold I can 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.310
 bring this result apart it 's good 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.940
 because I still do not bring obsidian to 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.460
 Grips pinches me no silly do not hold 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.650
 very stupid you can grab all look of

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.870
 break 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:42.599
 and thus get god god 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:43.559
 frames he destroyed he built frames is 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:47.069

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.039
 looted all the eggs and they are given 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:42.789
 account there in the menu only remained 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:45.520
 the one with pink on his face was only the 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:47.289

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.639

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:04.839
 It was loaded and we took an egg and 

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:05.229
 Well, this is how friends are like this is this
