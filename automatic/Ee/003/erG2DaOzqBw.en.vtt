00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.590
 and now let's get to know the 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.079
 last two classified no one thing is 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.779
 I certainly do n't care if I sit down, no no 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.780
 I do n't care then the penultimate 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:39.949
 classified second classified 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:47.210
 shalrie joseph xerry sanchez and have it 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:47.720
 company choice 16 st come forward ser 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.030
 the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.580
 I have chosen you entered among the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.830
 finalists but now let's get to know each other 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.080
 our first ranked girl 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.470
 was the most voted for the selections 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.100
 of fighting for fame first 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.100
 classified 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.090
 but the locations at 100 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 the main thought 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:22.330
 let's 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 rusco and rosemary blues have been reported 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.479
 man who will say no 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 and I thought this was a 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.570
 competition of a certain level 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.430
 and I thought this was a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.070
 competition for people with a minimum of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.750
 apparently difficult to the first 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.370
 two classified already knew each other e 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.620
 also very well 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.480
 certainly also for this I would prefer not 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.610
 be confused with certain people 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.550
 I mean just look at it to understand 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 why but just a taste of that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.920
 which you will see here 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.360
 in the only television reality show that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.310
 will launch the new star of the song 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 that is to say fighting for fame 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.570
 I am sorry because you will never succeed 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.070
 to beat me you can also stop 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.600
 enjoying yourself here I will win is obvious 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.280
 the idea of ​​being continually revived 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 I get nervous, I don't even know where 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 we are 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.180
 then let me explain it to you now 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.250
 in plain words you love these very well 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.550
 shows usually take place in places 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.340
 more exotic and more glamorous than the post world 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.930
 the rich class has this as the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.370
 you know 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.380
 simple because the little explains it 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.590
 famous girl's manual page 6 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.320
 second chapter paragraph 2 and why 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 I'm the number one fan of reality shows 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.489
 by the way, look at some 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.160
 television would do wonders for yours 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.810
 culture means like you that you do n't 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.239
 nothing but expanding your culture 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.070
 on certain fashion magazines and if so 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.110
 you also would n't get tanned 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.220
 so trimming to say the least 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.720
 horrifying to have to endure 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.830
 are you sure you are contributing to the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720
 final score also physical strength 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.770
 I hear a ringing in my ears 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.230
 same data as yesterday from the uncle is like 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.630
 then you are the fly tzè tzè I order you from 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.520
 never call me that again because I don't 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.500
 I apologize 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.450
 anyway now it will be better for you to give 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.390
 to do to collect all the points you 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.390
 you can because here you will have to see it with 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.030
 rosemary and I would then come back to you 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.000
 second of course later but none 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.770
 hope and who or are you alone 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.350
 so I suggest you admire it 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.470
 style with which I walk straight towards the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.470
 glory 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.070
 may be this is too one like me 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.720
 can't stand it 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.800
 I'm leaving give up as the prize 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.230
 they do it 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.640
 I'm sorry but if you leave the group 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.800
 will remain in complete and will skip the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.930
 program so you can't do this 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.150
 she is a real girl and this is a group 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.160
 specially formed to achieve a 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.750
 objective and therefore cannot 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.510
 absolutely divide 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.780
 and then what could we do ourselves 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.370
 without your elegance but it's obvious 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.370
 absolutely nothing but if reviewing the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.260
 monster face of a monster of a 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.920
 show why this is actually is the 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.210
 palace of horrors and now bye bye 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.050
 all you know you should try 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.450
 convince 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.340
 the excuse that you care so much rosemary 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.110
 is just afraid to arrive or the team at 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.490
 milan competition is listening to me 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.160
 like the Lucanians I want to go to 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.860
 dance you do n't love pigsties not here you 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.630
 wait , we both know that 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.340
 this awful place 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.160
 finally we agree then 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.960
 let's go Russian together and then the arrival 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.180
 I certainly don't want to look like the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.840
 coward like someone I know not to the two do not 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 we are leaving 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 not at all because from here no one can 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 Leave 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.350
 I apologize to spalletti but certainly me 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.810
 presents girls right away my name is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.940
 marcos marcos cosman and am the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.890
 producer is the creator of struggling for 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.320
 does it then lets you tell her that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.960
 this place deserves the triple r worth a 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.760
 repulsive repulsive to say repellent 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.830
 and that nobody can prevent me from doing it 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.110
 I go to this point I must remember them 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.790
 miss rosemary that all of you together 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.560
 your representatives have signed 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.660
 a contract that says that 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.730
 none of you can abandon the 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:45.040
 competition like that can't be 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.470
 put away the girls handkerchiefs 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.320
 because you must know that I carmelo

 you feel like your name is obvious 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.830
 as a girl like me you can't stay in 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.420
 a place like this and then we would have 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.790
 had to participate in a singing contest 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.190
 not to those who eat more milk than silence 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.680
 Miss the break over, my name is 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.250
 tatiana and I am the sole coordinator of 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.250
 this race 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.440
 this reason silence discipline 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.610
 misses 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.170
 now my job is to 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.870
 transform you physically and mentally 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.180
 charming professionals though 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.490
 at least for some it will be impossible in 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.320
 effects like I was just saying one 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.650
 professional singer must be 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.540
 prepared just like that and now entering 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.370
 immediately in the midst of fighting for fame 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.960
 our delicious six finalists 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.120
 they will have to face the hardest first 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.040
 try the wild thing route 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.040
 the first for stuff
