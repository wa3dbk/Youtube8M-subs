00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
16th March 2012, Sher-e-Bangla Stadium was not like this that day.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.000
On that very day, on that Asia cup match, the whole stadium witnessed a history in making.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
Sachin Tendulkar became the first man to score 100th century in cricket against Bangladesh, in Bangladesh.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When Sachin got out after a 114-run innings, all the lenses were aimed at the little master.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.000
The cameramen did not know, the tifer bowler they ignored would be the last Bangladeshi to take Sachin't wicket,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.000
the whole stadium did not know that Sachin
would play only one more ODI after this,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Mashrafee himself didn't know, no matter how many records he makes, he would never get another wicket of the man who has held the record of making records.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.000
Mashrafe: "I will always remember this. Not just in my cricket career, as long as I live I will remember this.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.000
There was this match between Asia XI and World XI. I was very young
then. I ran away from my home, from Narail,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:17.000
came to Dhaka only to see Sachin Tendulkar.
That was the first time I saw this legend, in person."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Do you remember the first Bangladeshi to take Sachin's wicket?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
It was the Sharjah Asia cup in 1995. It was the first time Bangladesh faced Sachin.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.000
Mohammad Rafiq: "It was my debut match and I got Sachin's wicket.It was a great achievement for me and my team.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It was the only wicket Bangladesh got in that match.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:55.000
In the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, India lost to us.  Sachin was staying right beside my room.We chatted almost until midnight.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.100
Sachin joked that we had stabbed them on the chest. I asked how and he said you defeated us and that ended our world cup."

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:19.980
The Bangladesh chapter in Sachin's epic started with Rafiq and ended with Mashrafee. No matter how many wickets the tiger bowlers take in the future, they will never get the wicket of the Super Hero of cricket. Aantaki Raisa, Ekattor
