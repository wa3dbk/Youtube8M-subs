00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.429
 this new video as you know today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.690
 August 24th is the day of new super 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 mario bros 2 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.340
 yes yes I went to the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.640
 store bought my copy of new 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.430
 super mario bros 2 for nintendo 3ds 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 as you can see I paid 40 999 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 however the games for 3ds have a 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.439
 quite high price lately and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439
 it 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 let's say I absolutely don't like it too 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.510
 because I don't think a game for 3ds 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.590
 may be worth all this money 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 obviously an institution for supermario 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 I bought the 3ds just to play at 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.570
 important titles like super mario zelda 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 etcetera etc. like the exclusive e 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.210
 I couldn't help buying it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.210
 but now let's go from boxing this sta 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.970
 fantastic packaging and let's see what we have 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 we find inside as well you know new 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.040
 super mario bros 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.979
 the first new super mario bros was a 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.650
 title after it has been successful 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.300
 we say a great success of s 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.190
 even played it on nintendo ds mi is 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.710
 liked a casino 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.840
 a new mario for everyone whenever you want 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.610
 obviously there are various screens of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 game but now we proceed to unboxing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 as you can see the box is from 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 yellow color I know if you notice it's right 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 because it goes to recall what they are 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.909
 the supermario coins in fact in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 this game with coins will be of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.289
 vital importance and there will also be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.759
 the goal of reaching one million 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.079
 coins in fact there is written collects the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.180
 million coins but let's go to open 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.600
 the packaging obviously fall like this a 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.539
 to fuck 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 the nintendo club ratings and I put them 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.609
 aside 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.890
 then we have this fantastic booklets 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.960
 of instruction of a page now ne 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.899
 he intends to have accustomed us with the controls 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 fountains plus two fundamental of mario 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.360
 now the nintendo is gone too 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.530
 let's say he's disappointing us with these 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 booklets away and then we have a catalog 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.140
 that this is obviously in color and piero 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.160
 of pages but what do I do with it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.580
 away the disputes that if you play too much at 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.010
 3ds mori is a very beautiful thing 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.080
 I noticed it's obviously beyond the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.630
 game cartridge that comes with 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.620
 this really really nice skin 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.720
 which shows the title of the game in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.360
 this ends sisters as well as in mario 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.790
 3d land there are figures in this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.630
 case of coins and other characters e 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.610
 if we are going to extract the cover of the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.450
 game we can see this magnificent 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.530
 design which is very very beautiful 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.090
 obviously everything is classic 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.220
 cover and that of boys this was the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.450
 boxing of new super mario bros 2 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.910
 leave a thumb up if it is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.560
