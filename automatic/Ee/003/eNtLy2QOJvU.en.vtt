00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:50.170
 We'll need magazines from 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:50.170

00:00:50.650 --> 00:01:01.159
 entrepreneur packaging may be of 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:06.920
 remedy or shampoo provided that they are 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:10.210
 our magazine there at the end of the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 our magazine exists in some ads 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.720
 the next few copies of the magazines 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:24.040
 covers the photos of the covers and thumbnails 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.040
 Then we'll cut one of those photos. 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:42.530
 ok leaving leftover above and below 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.719
 front we are now going to cut only the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.140
 left side 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.140
 very close to our magazine photo 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.320
 well in the part of the folding that is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.550
 for our magazine to be very perfect 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.550
 Let's pass the stick glue and let's paste the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.550
 photo of our magazine 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.459
 in this way 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.980
 Now we're going to draw a fire from the 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:44.780
 magazine that folded to it in the form of 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:47.209 --> 00:03:12.359
 time and we will pull the leftover cut 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:16.440
 side this side we'll stick on 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:20.030
 cover of our magazine with liquid glue 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.030
 in this way 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:40.220

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.320
 we put it on and let it dry for 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.500
 some minutes 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.710

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.750
 after dry you take the entrepreneur 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.200
