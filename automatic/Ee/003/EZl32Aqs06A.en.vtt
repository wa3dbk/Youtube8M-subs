00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.710 
wanted to do a hair update but I thought
ninety<00:01:13.700> percent<00:01:13.729> of<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.180> guys<00:01:14.360> probably

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
don't even care about my hair so I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.740 
don't even care about my hair so I
thought<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:16.850> should<00:01:17.000> make<00:01:17.300> another<00:01:17.450> video

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.630 
thought I should make another video
because<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.500> also<00:01:18.740> thought<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.100> was<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.400> little

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
because I also thought it was a little

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.700 
because I also thought it was a little
bit<00:01:19.790> weird<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.150> do<00:01:20.509> a<00:01:20.540> video<00:01:20.869> like<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.200> with

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
bit weird to do a video like that with

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.430 
bit weird to do a video like that with
