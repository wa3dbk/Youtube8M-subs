it<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> little<00:04:20.329> domination<00:04:20.989> while<00:04:21.109> they're

play<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> think<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.139> why<00:04:24.350> they're<00:04:24.560> scoring

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
play I think that's why they're scoring

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:35.450
