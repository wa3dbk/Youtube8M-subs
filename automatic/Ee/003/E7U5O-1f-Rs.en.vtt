00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
right over them and it looks pretty good
either<00:00:57.090> way<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.360> mean<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.649> neat

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
either way I mean it's it's a neat

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
either way I mean it's it's a neat
little<00:00:59.359> extra<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.539> mean<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> piece<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
little extra I mean like a piece of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.889 
little extra I mean like a piece of
armor<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.780> that's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
armor that can go on them I think that's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
armor that can go on them I think that's
a<00:01:04.080> neat<00:01:04.260> idea<00:01:04.409> other<00:01:04.799> than<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.659> missile

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a neat idea other than like a missile

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.179 
a neat idea other than like a missile
launcher<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.140> goes<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.560> his<00:01:07.650> arm<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
launcher that goes on his arm that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.310 
launcher that goes on his arm that
doesn't<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:08.729> too<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.000> sense<00:01:09.320> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
doesn't really make too much sense but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
doesn't really make too much sense but
it<00:01:10.830> looks<00:01:10.979> cool<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.450> it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
much paint detail at all I was a little

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.490 
much paint detail at all I was a little
disappointed<00:03:03.490> with<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.640> but<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.270> can<00:03:05.110> see<00:03:05.350> why

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
disappointed with that but I can see why

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.310 
disappointed with that but I can see why
they<00:03:05.710> did<00:03:06.010> put<00:03:06.610> lack<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.120> paint<00:03:07.330> detail<00:03:07.630> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
they did put lack of paint detail so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.900 
they did put lack of paint detail so
then<00:03:08.470> what<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.710> mark<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.130> they<00:03:09.310> could<00:03:09.490> add<00:03:09.700> on

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
then what the mark for they could add on

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.150 
then what the mark for they could add on
the<00:03:09.940> little<00:03:10.210> gold<00:03:10.510> detailing<00:03:10.930> in<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> chest

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
go front and back so as you can see it's

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.240 
go front and back so as you can see it's
not<00:04:13.540> too<00:04:13.720> bad<00:04:13.870> they<00:04:14.380> can<00:04:14.530> bend<00:04:14.739> at<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:14.920> knee<00:04:15.130> at

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
not too bad they can bend at the knee at

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.750 
not too bad they can bend at the knee at
two<00:04:15.519> points<00:04:15.760> which<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.840> very<00:04:17.080> nice<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
two points which is very nice and the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.740 
two points which is very nice and the
feet<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.239> rotate<00:04:19.570> 360<00:04:20.290> degrees<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.940> decent

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
feet can rotate 360 degrees so a decent

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.150 
feet can rotate 360 degrees so a decent
amount<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.960> articulation<00:04:23.650> for<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> figure

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
amount of articulation for the figure

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.880 
amount of articulation for the figure
it's<00:04:24.400> not<00:04:24.580> bad<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.440> it's<00:04:26.440> actually<00:04:26.740> quite

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
it's not bad and it's actually quite

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's not bad and it's actually quite
good

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
good

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.119 
good
the<00:04:28.750> only<00:04:28.930> bad<00:04:29.050> thing<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.379> when<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.830> have<00:04:29.949> this

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
the only bad thing is when you have this

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.369 
the only bad thing is when you have this
piece<00:04:30.370> on<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.729> cannot<00:04:31.060> move<00:04:31.210> his<00:04:31.360> arms<00:04:31.780> or<00:04:31.960> his

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
piece on you cannot move his arms or his

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.680 
piece on you cannot move his arms or his
torso<00:04:32.680> just<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.699> all<00:04:33.879> the<00:04:33.909> other<00:04:34.150> iron<00:04:34.419> man

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
torso just like all the other iron man

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.809 
torso just like all the other iron man

suit that you can all put together and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.070 
suit that you can all put together and
make<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.470> suit<00:04:41.710> which<00:04:42.009> is<00:04:42.340> nice<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.879> I'm<00:04:43.810> really

liking these and comes with the numbers
and<00:04:45.879> all<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.330> think<00:04:46.870> these<00:04:46.960> are<00:04:47.020> very<00:04:47.409> cool

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
and all that I think these are very cool

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.119 
and all that I think these are very cool
so<00:04:48.129> overall<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.729> mark<00:04:49.000> 3<00:04:49.330> iron<00:04:49.539> man<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:50.139> a<00:04:50.590> good

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
so overall the mark 3 iron man is a good

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.360 
so overall the mark 3 iron man is a good
buy<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.699> really<00:04:52.180> do<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.509> his<00:04:52.780> ad<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.229> armor<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
buy I really do like his ad on armor I

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.920 
buy I really do like his ad on armor I
do<00:04:54.699> think<00:04:55.030> it's<00:04:55.150> better<00:04:55.300> than<00:04:55.479> some<00:04:55.690> sort<00:04:55.900> of

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
do think it's better than some sort of

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.309 
do think it's better than some sort of
missile<00:04:56.259> projectile<00:04:56.830> or<00:04:56.860> anything<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.580> that

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
missile projectile or anything like that

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.779 
missile projectile or anything like that
it's<00:04:59.319> a<00:04:59.440> neat<00:04:59.650> little<00:04:59.800> feature<00:04:59.949> how<00:05:00.400> the

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
it's a neat little feature how the

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.540 
it's a neat little feature how the
little<00:05:00.940> wings<00:05:01.270> lift<00:05:01.629> up<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.080> fold<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.979> I

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
little wings lift up and fold in and I

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.399 
little wings lift up and fold in and I
think<00:05:03.759> it<00:05:03.849> looks<00:05:03.879> great<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.479> them<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:04.990> not

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
think it looks great on them it's not

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.990 
think it looks great on them it's not
bad<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:05.979> does<00:05:06.129> make<00:05:06.340> up<00:05:06.550> for<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.789> lack<00:05:06.940> of

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
bad and it does make up for the lack of

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.020 
bad and it does make up for the lack of
paint<00:05:07.449> detailing<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.139> body<00:05:08.669> so<00:05:09.669> he's<00:05:09.879> not

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
paint detailing on the body so he's not

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.209 
paint detailing on the body so he's not
too<00:05:10.270> bad<00:05:10.509> for<00:05:10.539> your<00:05:10.930> basic<00:05:11.379> Iron<00:05:11.710> Man<00:05:11.860> figure

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
too bad for your basic Iron Man figure

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.879 
too bad for your basic Iron Man figure
so<00:05:12.610> yes<00:05:12.969> I<00:05:13.120> would<00:05:13.150> recommend<00:05:13.599> him<00:05:13.870> but<00:05:14.590> that's

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
so yes I would recommend him but that's

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.070 
so yes I would recommend him but that's
