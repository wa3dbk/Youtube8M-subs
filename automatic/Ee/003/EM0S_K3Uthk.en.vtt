 hello everyone with you before goal 73 is in front of you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 new developer answers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.320
 so go recently you did a survey 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.830
 premium account with 75 percent credits 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 and 25 percent experience and vice versa as there 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 their implementation is progressing or you found 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.449
 unprofitable these premium account and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.089
 the developers have answered this yet 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.969
 We do but not completely abandoned 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.640
 lies in the bank idea whether you are planning 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.460
 change application icon developers 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.069
 answered yes in the future we would like to plan 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.690
 would remind that the icon is already 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.999
 altered under various events 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.549
 are you planning to re-enter voiceovers 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.530
 struck and hit with tablets 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.420
 situation when you shoot and you get 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.120
 the enemy who is not lit 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.780
 developers answered no only removed 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 does it wait for an improvement optimization on 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.229
 android devices future developers 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.450
 gave the answer to work on performance 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.659
 we don't stop it permanent 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.649
 process we all know what modules are hidden 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 specifications 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.200
 why not make these parameters 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.759
 open and visible 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.609
 the developers answered this question 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 related to a common ideology 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.450
 operating here games like mechanics 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.369
 combat almost identical 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.229
 open any parameters in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 mobile tanks that were not 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.570
 published in the world of tanks for now we 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 hardly we will wait when the timer 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 recharging in sight and some 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 settings for sight developers 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.899
 answered so far we have questions on 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.719
 translucent element and customization 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.090
 elements of sight but the plans have long been 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.770
 there is one of the priority cards to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.280
 rework lost temple 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 let them x great card whats with her 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 not this way 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.100
 developers gave the answer vps optimization 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.409
 cutting out extra trees is small 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.690
 reworking the city to avoid cases 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.600
 where the main battle takes place in one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 risk rebalancing corner and place for 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.110
 capture 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 is it right to understand that branches lt 8 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.000
 Americans are also shelved 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.310
 the developers answered are planning 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.129
 potesting different levels of drummers on 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.269
 internal tests after this will be 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.540
 more understandable that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.220
 and how are you going 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.950
 rebalance tank maus developers 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.890
 answered a little about whether 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.950
 redesigned sight in 19 developers 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.200
 answered at 19 apparently not we 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.209
 We are working not only on a range finder but 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.540
 also over the reload timer and 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.400
 the possibility of customizing sight still you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.379
 planning to correct the error with 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.019
 tablets and nvidia shield tablet 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.900
 or rather idle motion sticks 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.450
 tank if yes then when developers 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.489
 answered we know about the problem 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
 will the problem be fixed 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.640
 erasing chat messages on ios 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.840
 developers answered the problem is transferred 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.549
 tester and studied 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.890
 these were the most interesting answers 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.780
