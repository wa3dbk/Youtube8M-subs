00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.840
 abuja you were last week as 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.730
 Coach dismissed from tasmania berlin 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 how did I say that? 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.619
 was highly cited after the training 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 sat the full board where we have 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.849
 informed that they pull the rip cord 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:32.669
 want and and suspend me 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:34.770
 What was the exact reason after you 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.190
 has informed that pull the pull line 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 They said that the story 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.620
 again team manager mobile and that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.219
 therefore a profit was up to now for the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.930
 club is and the club now holds 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 I do not want to work with me anymore 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.600
 then it was also athletic that it 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.550
 time sporty everything fits all 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.850
 wonderful is that everything is in the lot 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.049
 and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.630
 but basically three of us were clearly like that 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.820
 my brother swans me that it 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.450
 actually the topic is about 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.580
 nothing else 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 the first chairman of tasmania 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.310
 berlin detlef witte spoke in one 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.649
 official statement of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.880
 inhuman behavior and mobbing 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.250
 in pure culture that was really 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.729
 between him and this team manager 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.930
 the problem 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.479
 I had no problem so far with 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.039
 She just did not want to stop her 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.420
 So we have our team because I stop 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.250
 people around me would like to have 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.569
 Everyone is pursuing the same goal 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.420
 pull together and all for the 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.409
 success of the team all submission 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.580
 and there she was different and has me 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.350
 not so fit i keep coming back 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.819
 in the talks also pointed that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.649
 I do not want to send away that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.020
 I do not have the competence either 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.420
 to send them away but I have that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.009
 unite or talk about wild very much 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.009
 Often you then asked one stop 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.469
 new place in the youth area where too 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.070
 always to give that he continues in the club 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.329
 can remain 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.200
 but that they no longer hold so 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:14.829
 but first team has to do that 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.060
 always close to deaf ears so never 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.829
 the situations give as it did 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.959
 Mister Wilde was described that she 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.410
 private problems at this 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.700
 team manager has left out 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.470
 so honestly my private 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.109
 problems do not concern anyone 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.820
 Second, I never have anyone 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.310
 different my private problems 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.230
 hilarious and have my private 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.549
 problems never synonymous to the team's turn 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.480
 let me have always taken care of it 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.489
 that the things that happened in private 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.220
 are not born in the team 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.530
 because success is a lot for me 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.549
 was more important than my private one 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.680
 problems so that was not so 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.420
 your brother months you were the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.340
 co-trainer and also have the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.900
 Club relieved 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.400
 how did you experience the situation for 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.920
 Of course it was natural for me 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.620
 one can not expect that if the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.200
 brothers 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.379
 holidays are dismissed or suspended 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.269
 I go then so we 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.709
 of course, a very strong three 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.890
 unit by wind and goods 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.150
 and there it was not a thought of me now 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.690
 somehow to continue and to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.879
 stay 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.540
 and who believes that the brother dan 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.640
 has continued the bill without the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 Wirt made 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.549
 We have experienced the situation 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.579
 stories about these alleged 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.110
 Private problems well it's here at all 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.849
 not about private problems you because 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.069
 in the team or at any one 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.900
 it leaves it out so that it does 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.180
 Normally everyone rules football 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.150
 Trainer makes rules on each trainer 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.220
 has his quirks his rituals and if 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.260
 a coach says okay i want that 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.780
 Entire supervisor team in the cabin 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.909
 at meetings or team meetings 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.730
 because, the coach of the handled so 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.530
 we have not even had time off and 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.640
 We said we want to be with the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.859
 team alone this 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.349
 Do not have a team meeting either 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.579
 except cabin kicked out because 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.959
 during the preparation of the players 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.489
 We were not in the cabin 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.010
 the special thing you do is make your music 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.269
 whatever we have there as we hear 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.400
 trainergespann nothing to look for 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.669
 and of course the whole thing 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.669
 carer team
