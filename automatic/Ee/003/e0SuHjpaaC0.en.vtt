digging up geraniums to keep over the
winter<00:00:08.059> is<00:00:08.240> easy<00:00:08.630> to<00:00:09.050> do<00:00:09.230> we<00:00:09.769> would<00:00:09.980> go<00:00:10.160> all<00:00:10.520> the

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
winter is easy to do we would go all the

way around dig it up carefully lift it
out<00:00:13.990> we'd<00:00:14.990> pull<00:00:15.200> all<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.559> old<00:00:15.740> dead<00:00:15.950> flowers

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
out we'd pull all the old dead flowers

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.550 
out we'd pull all the old dead flowers
off<00:00:16.699> and<00:00:17.000> leaves<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:17.900> we're<00:00:18.080> going<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.260> clean

to<00:00:24.289> plant<00:00:24.440> too<00:00:24.650> deep<00:00:24.890> we'll<00:00:25.220> take<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.610> plant

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
to plant too deep we'll take the plant

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
but it won't freeze and just set them in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.820 
but it won't freeze and just set them in
there<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.940> minimal<00:01:05.420> water<00:01:05.630> just<00:01:06.380> enough<00:01:06.710> to

there with minimal water just enough to
keep<00:01:06.980> my<00:01:07.160> live<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:07.610> not<00:01:07.730> enough<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.060> encourage

keep my live but not enough to encourage
growth<00:01:08.690> and<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.470> can<00:01:09.560> hold<00:01:09.740> them<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.040> through

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
growth and you can hold them on through

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.590 
growth and you can hold them on through
the<00:01:10.400> winter<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.820> pot<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.180> then<00:01:11.270> go<00:01:11.450> ahead

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
the winter in a pot and then go ahead

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.570 
the winter in a pot and then go ahead
and<00:01:11.720> put<00:01:11.840> them<00:01:12.020> out<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.260> garden<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.340> now

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
and put them out in the garden and now

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.450 
and put them out in the garden and now
if<00:01:13.880> we're<00:01:14.240> just<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:15.010> knock<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.190> soil

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
if we're just going to knock the soil

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.610 
if we're just going to knock the soil
off<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.730> roots<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.450> bare<00:01:17.840> root<00:01:18.080> them<00:01:18.260> we're

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
off the roots and bare root them we're

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.110 
off the roots and bare root them we're
just<00:01:18.860> going<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.070> reach<00:01:19.280> down<00:01:19.520> around<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.970> base

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
just going to reach down around the base

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.360 
just going to reach down around the base
and<00:01:20.390> pull<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> plant<00:01:21.230> up<00:01:21.440> retaining<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.220> little

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
and pull the plant up retaining a little

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.830 
and pull the plant up retaining a little
bit<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.760> root<00:01:22.910> but<00:01:23.120> we<00:01:23.210> don't<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.660> worry

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
bit of root but we don't have to worry

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.380 
bit of root but we don't have to worry
about<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.410> rest<00:01:24.620> of<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:24.950> much<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.180> take

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
about the rest of it so much if you take

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.930 
about the rest of it so much if you take
about<00:01:26.720> all<00:01:27.290> half<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:28.100> two-thirds<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.850> the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
about all half to two-thirds of the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.120 
about all half to two-thirds of the
leaves<00:01:29.180> off<00:01:29.510> make<00:01:30.380> sure<00:01:30.590> there's<00:01:30.800> no<00:01:30.920> flower

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
leaves off make sure there's no flower

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.310 
leaves off make sure there's no flower
buds<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.760> so<00:01:32.390> if<00:01:32.570> we're<00:01:32.750> going<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.900> bare<00:01:33.110> root

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
buds and so if we're going to bare root

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.420 
buds and so if we're going to bare root
and<00:01:33.470> hang<00:01:33.590> them<00:01:33.680> up<00:01:33.860> we're<00:01:34.010> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.160> get<00:01:34.310> them

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
and hang them up we're going to get them

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.030 
and hang them up we're going to get them
like<00:01:34.580> this<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.720> cold<00:01:36.080> damp<00:01:36.500> dark

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
like this in a cold damp dark

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.460 
like this in a cold damp dark
environment<00:01:37.760> like<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.940> basement<00:01:38.470> hanging

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
environment like a basement hanging

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.860 
environment like a basement hanging
upside<00:01:39.830> down<00:01:39.860> bare<00:01:40.340> root<00:01:40.610> they<00:01:41.240> will<00:01:41.450> survive

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
upside down bare root they will survive

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.230 
upside down bare root they will survive
the<00:01:42.140> winter<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.620> about<00:01:42.920> two<00:01:43.640> out<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.850> three

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the winter and about two out of three

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.300 
the winter and about two out of three
plants<00:01:44.540> will<00:01:45.230> grow<00:01:45.409> again<00:01:45.770> when<00:01:45.980> you<00:01:46.070> find

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
plants will grow again when you find

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.560 
plants will grow again when you find
them<00:01:46.430> out<00:01:46.550> in<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.760> spring<00:01:47.060> you'll<00:01:47.270> cut<00:01:47.480> them

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
them out in the spring you'll cut them

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.690 
them out in the spring you'll cut them
back<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.020> plant<00:01:48.830> them<00:01:48.980> and<00:01:49.130> they<00:01:49.220> will<00:01:49.400> grow

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
back and plant them and they will grow

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.750 
back and plant them and they will grow
so<00:01:50.600> that's<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.590> old-fashioned<00:01:52.220> way<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.640> it

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
so that's the old-fashioned way but it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.630 
so that's the old-fashioned way but it
is<00:01:52.790> effective<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.630> won't<00:01:53.840> save<00:01:54.080> 100%<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.340> just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
is effective you won't save 100% so just

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.250 
is effective you won't save 100% so just
dig<00:01:55.850> more<00:01:56.060> than<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.300> think<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.600> need<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.080> put

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
dig more than you think you need and put

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.960 
dig more than you think you need and put
them<00:01:57.380> down<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.010> it<00:01:58.550> seems<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.880> work

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
them down there and it seems to work

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.969 
them down there and it seems to work
well<00:01:59.330> if<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.840> have<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.200> basement<00:02:00.710> or<00:02:00.860> of
