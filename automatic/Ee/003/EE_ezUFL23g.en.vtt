00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
we're just going to do amps in a custom

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.460 
we're just going to do amps in a custom
tray<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.550> both<00:02:08.879> amps<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.810> distribution

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
tray so I have both amps my distribution

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.460 
tray so I have both amps my distribution
that<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.220> both<00:02:11.400> amps

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
that I'm going to have to both amps

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.860 
that I'm going to have to both amps
and<00:02:12.590> next<00:02:12.920> thing<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.940> will<00:02:14.150> pull<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.480> you

and next thing is this will pull out you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.330 
and next thing is this will pull out you
can<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.140> how<00:02:15.170> much<00:02:15.380> room<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.650> had<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.890> work<00:02:16.100> with

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
input I'm going to try that see if I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.450 
input I'm going to try that see if I
like<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.720> sound<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.710> overall<00:02:43.220> what

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
like it see if the sound is overall what

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.870 
like it see if the sound is overall what
I<00:02:43.490> want<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.920> we'll<00:02:46.160> figure<00:02:46.760> out

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
I want if not then we'll figure out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.270 
I want if not then we'll figure out
another<00:02:47.000> way<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.930> some<00:02:48.110> processing<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.040> go

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
another way to do some processing and go

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.830 
another way to do some processing and go
from<00:02:49.400> there

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.960
