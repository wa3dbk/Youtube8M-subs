burners I got them from Agra supply and
they<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.750> low-pressure<00:00:10.880> orifices<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:11.940> them

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530

work on all right here we go we're going
to<00:00:38.390> turn<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:42.200> open<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> flame<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.670> open

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to turn it on open up the flame or open

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.080 
to turn it on open up the flame or open
up<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> gas

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.560 

that's<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.140> even<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.649> high<00:00:56.420> I'm<00:00:57.420> in

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that's not really even very high I'm in

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's not really even very high I'm in
the<00:00:57.660> garage<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:59.059> I've<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> garage

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the garage right now I've got the garage

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.180 
the garage right now I've got the garage
door<00:01:00.840> open<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.690> drugs<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.290> cracked<00:01:04.619> open<00:01:04.860> just

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
door open and drugs or cracked open just

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.680 
door open and drugs or cracked open just
a<00:01:05.309> little<00:01:05.339> keep<00:01:05.759> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.940> airflow<00:01:06.360> through

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
a little keep a little airflow through

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.670 
a little keep a little airflow through
here<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.400> okay<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> flame<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> got

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.760 

a<00:01:13.240> little<00:01:14.240> bit<00:01:14.360> orange<00:01:14.690> in<00:01:14.810> there<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:15.530> mean

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
a little bit orange in there but I mean

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.190 
a little bit orange in there but I mean
I<00:01:15.800> think<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.220> can<00:01:16.900> just<00:01:17.900> see<00:01:19.300> if<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.480> cut<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.080> air

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
I think I can just see if I cut the air

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.389 
I think I can just see if I cut the air
off<00:01:21.260> too<00:01:21.590> much<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:21.980> not<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> bit<00:01:22.700> much

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
off too much it's not a bit much

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:34.090 
off too much it's not a bit much
so<00:01:24.820> there's<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.299> one

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.320 

there's<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.700> one<00:01:34.940> I'm<00:01:35.120> going<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.330> open<00:01:35.510> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
there's that one I'm going to open the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.030 
there's that one I'm going to open the
gas<00:01:38.330> on<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.750> second<00:01:39.350> burner

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.170 

have<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.730> cranked<00:01:46.180> up<00:01:46.330> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
have it cranked up to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.640 
have it cranked up to
that's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.230> wide<00:01:49.830> openness

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
that's not wide openness

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.140 
that's not wide openness
actually<00:01:52.430> not<00:01:52.640> even<00:01:52.820> very<00:01:53.240> very<00:01:53.660> hot

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
actually not even very very hot

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.610 
actually not even very very hot
that<00:01:56.540> kind<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.870> weird<00:01:57.050> look<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.470> I've

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
that kind of a weird look that I've

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.950 
that kind of a weird look that I've
never<00:01:58.060> noticed<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.420> fact<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.750> they're

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
never noticed the fact that they're

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.690 
never noticed the fact that they're
going<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.200> space<00:02:00.650> between<00:02:01.130> them<00:02:01.430> where<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
going to space between them where the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.190 
going to space between them where the
gas<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:01.910> going<00:02:02.330> out<00:02:02.450> on<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:02.660> environment

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
gas is going out on the environment

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.260 
gas is going out on the environment
that's<00:02:03.350> normal<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.010> don't<00:02:04.730> really<00:02:04.820> noticed

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
that's normal I don't really noticed

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.490 
that's normal I don't really noticed
that<00:02:05.450> before

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that before

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.249

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
like so that's with the gate with the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.130 
like so that's with the gate with the
gate<00:02:12.659> valves<00:02:13.019> that's<00:02:13.200> still<00:02:13.470> not<00:02:13.739> very<00:02:14.450> very<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
gate valves that's still not very very I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.130 
gate valves that's still not very very I
mean<00:02:16.590> I've<00:02:16.709> got<00:02:16.829> up<00:02:19.310> 889<00:02:20.310> ex-flame<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
mean I've got up 889 ex-flame on that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.610 
mean I've got up 889 ex-flame on that
one

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
