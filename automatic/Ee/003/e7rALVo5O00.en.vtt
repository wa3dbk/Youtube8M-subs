 but also the task of raising awareness 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.689
 about recycling in the main consumer protagonists the success of 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.510
 this try project covers all united states part of europe australia 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.650

 superior who want china or leather and drinks these three parts 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.190
 the different components that are transported where appropriate 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.370
 for lugo crush them in these coins and giants 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.080
 and so the raw material that is known as the Haitian was invested 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.140
 as lehendakari a granulated compound ideal for different surfaces 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.220
 sports 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 here for example the cup will crush this direction for the construction of tracks 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.100
 Of athletics 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.459
 the eagle and the leather instead are transformed into the filling materials 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.119
 for basketball surfaces 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.040
 Finally 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.629
 the support of the templates 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.290
 It becomes a strong but ideal base for fast tennis courts 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.109
 we had 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.370
 here everything you walk to run jump 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.079
 if in some way doing exercise 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.230
 the program and after 20 years for 100 euros and the recycling of 23 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 millions of pairs of used shoes 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.649
 so far in 2009, three hundred have been manufactured or developed 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:42.939
 courts of different surfaces so the program already has a very large 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.399
 important 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.569
 Now the challenge for the company is to translate the results of this model 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.670
 of sustainability 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 to other parts of the world and apparently in South America have already been hands to the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.159
 work

 well factory in latin america in brazil in argentina through 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.519
 contracted manufacturing 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.799
 and to which the same standards are applied as in which in terms 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.359
 to take care of the environment 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.959
 and punctually in Brazil zetas in a very interesting program with one of the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.069
 manufacturers 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.769
 that in the upper part the textile shoes almost eternally recycled to 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.079
 e everything that is the bosom of mattresses in order to an alliance with the factory of 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:18.899
 mattresses 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.339
 in argentina we are also encouraging the point of view of the manufacturers to 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.429
 the one who knew about him the alliance can be made so that all the rubber waste 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.469
 that your factory 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.159
 which manufacturers will be defined can be reincorporated into the system 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.159
 way either in the construction of courts or acting 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.519
 through ventures like these 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.819
 the commitment that we have to achieve what we call piquillo sero both in 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.099
 waste as recycling in a few words what about equity and what 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.529
 old is reprocessed for a new final product 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.080
 the philosophy of the company in quite holistic is not treated 3 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.910
 in every aspect of manufacturing the selection of those associated with what 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.899
 What do we do the products as it can be done to 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:04.709
 use materials that are less certainly not without before being presented with a 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.589
 organic cotton with recycled polyester that age and has a 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.219
 very large impact on the final product that offers harm to the environment that your 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.929
 base 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:17.069
 also in what is all the waste detractors try to diminish it 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.879
 will do as little as possible by refusing those materials that can be 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.449
 review lie and you throw at what age 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.629
 vl in the other portion play once the outbreak is manufactured and it 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.159
 it scared how it can be done to get it back 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.159
 to abuse in another way 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.350
 so you know very soon what we can not fly to church we're going 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.790
