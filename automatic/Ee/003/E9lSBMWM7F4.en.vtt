00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.779
 you see friends today we are here we are going to 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.360
 make a new way to form instead 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.830
 to throw this at you like this we are going to make a 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.790
 different way 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.860
 let's take two small balls 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.400
 as of size that you like with 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.400
 this balloon 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.439
 let's apply it here and here we would have 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.750
 four hours later we're going to do what 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.440
 same with the opposite side 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440
 but here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.110
 no no 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.160
 ready 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.720
 here we would have 4 and 4 we are going to loosen a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.079
 little our air 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.359
 equally expected 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.509
 to join them we're just going to stick it 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.340
 so already having it like this let's give it 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.340
 turns like this 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.600
 and also of doctorate 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 we give it to him and he's ready and we keep working 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.140
 with 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.720
 Thank you 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.530
 and we continue 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.470
 we take here 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.470
 let's say and move from one side to the other 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 until you get to the top 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.150
 you can put any color then 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.080
 put them red roses with which 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.080
 seek to improve it 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.300
 there are many ways to make different 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.300
 dresses we are going to have 2 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.170
 If they want 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.709
 following 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.760
 with this we are going to conclude so that the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.299
 video we can not do more next 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.299
 the shows 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.069
 when they are finished and you need 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.180
 slacker because simply add the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.180
 capital blogs 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.670
 and for the finalization we just go 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.760
 to withdraw 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.760
 ah 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.920
 and let's put it together 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.920
 they are children 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.230
 of some good 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.870
 just training would just be something 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.510
 well and we would work with our an idea 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.430
 so that they have and can do what 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.660
 like and the color they like 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.860
 I hope you liked it and we'll see you 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.860
 next video bay
