00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello to all the ferries and witches 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.620
 today I wanted to show you this kit for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 preparing gummy sweets is the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.309
 key trip hop in cook in and I have it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.620
 bought online comes from Japan 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.660
 in fact, as you can see only 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.240
 box is all written in Japanese 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.840
 however the use quite easy and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.150
 intuitive if you want to try your hand but 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.180
 we start immediately open the packet 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.680
 it's the first thing right now is you 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.230
 I show everything there is 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.050
 inside there are so much to start with 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 the molds that will be used to create the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.749
 your candies to shape them 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.039
 your candies 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.109
 I confess that I stayed a while 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.969
 disappointed by these here because of 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.409
 nicer around but in short, there are 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 let's do the same 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.339
 then there are some sachets they contain 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 the powders they serve just like 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.440
 base for sweets and as colorants 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.409
 then there is a bottle that is used for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.809
 dose the water who will use and the bottom 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.629
 white jig that is the small tray of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.489
 we will use to mix everything is i 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.040
 colors that then just the powder that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.630
 It serves to make the candy very much 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 very simple up to this point 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.520
 the first thing to do is to separate the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.880
 our molds from this structure of 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.680
 plastic in which they are still trapped 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 simple simple a quick thing 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.920
 there is as you can see also one 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.330
 fork that we need to mix 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.229
 to help us then get out the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.229
 shapes candy 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.580
 the next step and pay the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.350
 coloring the colored powders they are 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.460
 contained in these bags more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.230
 tiny 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.420
 in these compartments of our step 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.370
 white bed once we get it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.900
 poured the powder after we add 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.240
 the water so we will get just the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.320
 dye used to prepare the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.320
 real candy 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.630
 these three powders red the yellow and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.369
 blue does not only serve to color 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.010
 in reality they are not even what it gives 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.640
 taste to our dear mella on 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.560
 sachet there are illustrations afterwards 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.300
 I'll show you better, but I 'm there 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.030
 of the illustrations that explain exactly 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.910
 how to mix colors and flavors such as 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 can be obtained from the various 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.350
 stirring let's go ahead and pour 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.290
 the contents of this bag here 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.180
 larger in the compartment more 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.150
 great and forgive me again if 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.030
 I repeat myself in our slow pace 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.519
 now we take water to equip it 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.440
 we use this this bottle 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.390
 let's call it feminine plastic 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.730
 add a bottle of water a 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.370
 each of the powders and we have the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.500
 our beautiful and ready colored base 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.540
 of course we mix to make sure 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.970
 that the powders mix well with 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.110
 the water and then we move on is the co ve 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.459
 I said it before 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.040
 now you can see right on 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.660
 pack the symbols and combinations 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.380
 various in color and flavor I love the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.450
 wolf taste that violates the violent 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.630
 and in fact I'm preparing it for myself 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.890
 now mixing the red and blue and I have to 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.240
 say that right in this kit 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.610
 candy is that 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.380
 also taste my favorite color and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.910
 then you can see others are also made 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.220
 colors such as reason 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.240
 corresponds to the orange and then stirring 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.170
 the day the bus gets a taste that is 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.170
 similar to that of lemon 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.770
 once all the colors are prepared 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.140
 the real adventure begins 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.830
 before starting for the sake of 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.220
 clarity 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.540
 I will tell you that actually doing this 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.430
 what the procedure was a little more 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.170
 confusing than it seemed 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.740
 seeing tutorials made by other people 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.890
 but still go ahead is the row 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.590
 our mold in white powder 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.240
 here at the little plastic bottle yes 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.400
 adds the liquid a little to the 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.780
 once mixing the colors according to the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.320
 your tastes depending on what 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.570
 want 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.389
 I suck to color then not 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.129
 please note 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.569
 however the procedure is proposed as 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.999
 you can see add some 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.800
 liquid bit of colors to works and the 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.689
 candy is only been formed 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.759
 be careful not to put too much because 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.759
 otherwise the result is not pleasant 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.080
 I repeat the procedure as many times as I do 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.330
 candy I want to prepare now I'm in 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.370
 trying to make the penguin to accuse 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.229
 penguin formine that also apart 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.340
 this little girl with little eyes e 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.659
 commitment 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.780
 I must say that this thing to me is not 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.490
 loved it a lot is a little messed up 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.440
 here is better when they are used 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.810
 simply the molds without having to 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.419
 add more details later though 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.770
 in short, I am trying and the result 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.960
 you will soon see how I told you before 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.639
 do not use too much liquid 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.039
 because otherwise the candy remains 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.470
 unfortunately wet here does not come out 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.810
 perfect, however, once this is done 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.759
 procedure is the time to lift the 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.389
 our mold and take out the 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.550
 candy 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.340
 in reality it is very very very simple 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.470
 just help yourself with the fork with a 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.069
 other instruments and bring out the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.590
 candy 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.250
 and it is all there is ready and formed is not there 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.250
 nothing else to do 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.130
 in this specific case besides having 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.290
 made just the base of the penguin I have 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.139
 done in the other form in the eyes and the 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.419
 beak to apply them I put a kitchen 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.250
 of water so that the underside of it 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.770
 of my dear mella you come back to be 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.770
 sticky and fix these details 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.830
 and now you tell me what you say about it 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.360
 my penguin is 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.920
 as I told you, maybe it would have been 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.280
 better to have molds a little bit 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.540
 more essential but fine at this point 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.010
 what have I done 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.480
 I arrived at a time when later 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.670
 having made a little candy I have 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.590
 annoyed to find again with the molds and 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.780
 so I poured the color directly 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.180
 on the powder that I had left on 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.910
 advanced powder because I wanted to create 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.070
 a big burr candy well this is 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.750
 It was not my small madness 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.120
 that we can do it too you can 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.060
 simply limit yourself to using the 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.910
 molds that maybe is better 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.740
 and what else to say this is all there is 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.210
 showed the complete procedure not 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.430
 there is nothing else to add 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.380
 result of some candies and does it ve 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.870
 I'm showing it now so not 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.310
 I have to do nothing but tell me the 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.740
 taste of these candies 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.930
 I liked them they are very good they are 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.490
 they are little blacks they are certainly funny 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.830
 a bit confusing to prepare but it goes 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.480
 well okay i stop or call you to 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.190
 come and find me on instagram like al 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.840
 usually in all other places where 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.070
 you know you can find me I give myself a 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.210
 Basin merit appointment to the next 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.210
 hello video
