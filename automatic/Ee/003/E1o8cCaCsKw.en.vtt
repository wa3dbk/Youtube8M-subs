00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to all i'm going to show you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.730
 how to make a star box in 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.200
 origami then a material you have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.240
 need a sheet of paper while 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.859
 simple I took blue it may be 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.199
 one wears the colors of a ruler 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 on the one hand so little helped to cook who 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:30.000
 scream with the help of the rule and the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:35.370
 credit I drew a 20 cm square on 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 20 cm no it is necessary to cut 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 square 2 cm by 20 cm and we no longer 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.410
 need only the sheet so we go 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.800
 start by tracing the sapwood knows 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.800
 like this 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:07.850
 we do not like to get there, we go back to 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:25.220
 fire and have had some moments of 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:28.399
 media like these have voted more so 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.460
 we have a framework then we will take the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.770
 two sides the two ends like that one 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:42.619
 brings them back to Rome from above and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:44.990
 the one from below what we train so 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.729
 we're opening here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.250
 Mom now we want to make will 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.350
 bring that edge back to the central fold 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 here as is the same from the other 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.759
 side and behind we will do the same 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.759
 gets this form 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:16.370
 from there so good we open this 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:20.720
 party we support like that to make a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:26.120
 bit like that a layer of paris's 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.329
 the other side we like what we need 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.450
 start all over again 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:37.220
 here is the shape that we get from 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.750
 from there according to the price and the opening 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.890
 but here we will fold it inside 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.890
 of the model 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.850
 on the other side and behind the same 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.850
 way 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.510
 abbas beyond this point there and this 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:12.489
 weight there we will do we will score a 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:18.489
 fold so like this so mark the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.769
 pleasure of the folds so ways in 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.260
 to make another sore but on the other 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.570
 side this time so between these two 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.690
 points there and with this tip 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:35.160
 that's how we go back we do the same thing 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.160
 all the side and for the other points 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:52.389
 so now we're going to dismiss the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:57.280
 four pumps we get a start 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:59.170
 opening the box from there we go 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.120
 use the public have an effect on the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.510
 big tip for support on the sides 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.819
 and totally open the box a little 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:16.900
 risky without everything is folded 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:22.000
 and here is my form 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.360
 sc for us here is the end of the box in 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.360
 star
