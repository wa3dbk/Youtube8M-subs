00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.930 
that big debate you know about a girl
where's<00:02:30.590> my<00:02:30.620> cigar<00:02:30.980> dollars<00:02:31.310> well<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.580> think

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
where's my cigar dollars well I think

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.190 
where's my cigar dollars well I think
the<00:02:32.120> nearest<00:02:32.450> thing<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.660> god<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.110> was

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the nearest thing of a god to it was

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.520 
the nearest thing of a god to it was
having<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.500> Scotsman<00:02:33.980> he<00:02:34.130> was<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> killed<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:35.530> mean

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
having a Scotsman he was a killed I mean

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.550 
having a Scotsman he was a killed I mean
I<00:02:36.620> think<00:02:36.800> that'll<00:02:37.040> go<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.190> really<00:02:37.880> now

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
I think that'll go down really now

there<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:42.260> went<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.590> Doctor<00:02:42.920> Who<00:02:42.950> exhibition

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
there we went to Doctor Who exhibition

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.430 
there we went to Doctor Who exhibition
actually<00:02:43.850> going<00:02:44.030> took<00:02:44.239> some<00:02:44.480> some<00:02:44.780> true<00:02:45.080> fans

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
actually going took some some true fans

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.259 
actually going took some some true fans
I'd<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.070> what<00:02:46.220> they<00:02:46.400> thought<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.760> there's<00:02:47.030> no

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
I'd see what they thought and there's no

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.900 
I'd see what they thought and there's no
shortage<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.720> ideas<00:02:47.810> from<00:02:48.230> them<00:02:48.670> James<00:02:49.670> nests

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
shortage of ideas from them James nests

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.090 
shortage of ideas from them James nests
but<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.330> think<00:02:50.840> he<00:02:50.989> would<00:02:51.170> probably<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.590> given

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
but I think he would probably be given

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.860 
but I think he would probably be given
best<00:02:52.400> I'm<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.150> sure<00:02:53.209> Hannah<00:02:53.480> days<00:02:53.660> would<00:02:53.840> be

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
best I'm not sure Hannah days would be

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.780 
best I'm not sure Hannah days would be
very<00:02:54.380> good<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.920> think<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.430> would<00:02:55.519> be<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:55.760> of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
very good I think that would be a bit of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.000 
very good I think that would be a bit of
a<00:02:55.910> turnoff<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.269> me<00:02:56.450> personally<00:02:56.959> Simon<00:02:57.830> Pegg

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
a turnoff for me personally Simon Pegg

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.380 
a turnoff for me personally Simon Pegg
would<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.250> great<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.790> think<00:02:58.940> he's<00:02:59.060> got<00:02:59.209> too

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
would be great but I think he's got too

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.330 
would be great but I think he's got too
much<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> Hollywood<00:03:00.470> career<00:03:00.860> out<00:03:01.130> there

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
much of a Hollywood career out there

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460 
much of a Hollywood career out there
these<00:03:01.459> days<00:03:01.519> given<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> choice<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.260> dream

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
these days given a choice of a dream

these days given a choice of a dream
doctor<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:03.950> think<00:03:04.069> I<00:03:04.310> probably<00:03:04.400> got<00:03:04.610> Eddie

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
doctor I think I probably got Eddie

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.250 
doctor I think I probably got Eddie
years<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.660> think<00:03:05.840> would<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> fantastic

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
years I think would be a fantastic

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.620 
years I think would be a fantastic
choice<00:03:06.709> because<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.790> already<00:03:07.910> has<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.180> sort<00:03:08.600> of

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
choice because you already has a sort of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.020 
choice because you already has a sort of
otherworldly<00:03:09.080> quality<00:03:09.290> about<00:03:09.709> him<00:03:09.920> that's<00:03:10.850> a

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
otherworldly quality about him that's a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.449 
otherworldly quality about him that's a
