00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.840 
pretty much know coming into the fight I
mean<00:01:59.710> it's<00:01:59.859> just<00:01:59.979> pretty<00:02:00.130> much<00:02:00.280> what<00:02:00.429> his<00:02:00.549> MO

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
mean it's just pretty much what his MO

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.940 
mean it's just pretty much what his MO
is<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.810> same<00:02:01.990> thing<00:02:02.020> goes<00:02:02.229> for<00:02:02.350> shabbos<00:02:02.920> I

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
is and the same thing goes for shabbos I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.260 
is and the same thing goes for shabbos I
mean<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.429> they're<00:02:03.579> both<00:02:03.759> going<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:03.999> be<00:02:04.060> coming

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
mean so they're both going to be coming

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.539 
mean so they're both going to be coming
forward<00:02:04.859> it's<00:02:05.859> going<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.009> be<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.130> fight<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.369> a

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
forward it's going to be a fight with a

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.350 
forward it's going to be a fight with a
lot<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.759> action<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.940> guess<00:02:10.240> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
lot of action in it so I guess the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.400 
lot of action in it so I guess the
question<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.720> who's<00:02:10.900> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> win<00:02:11.260> this

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
question is who's going to win this

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650 
question is who's going to win this
fight<00:02:11.680> um

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
fight um

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.080 
fight um
I<00:02:13.720> mean<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:14.800> gonna<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.070> with<00:02:15.250> Chavez<00:02:15.610> Jr<00:02:15.640> I'm

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
going with Chavez Jr in this one uh

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.240 
going with Chavez Jr in this one uh
maybe<00:02:20.170> it'll<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.650> bit<00:02:20.860> competitive

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
maybe it'll be a little bit competitive

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.520 
maybe it'll be a little bit competitive
due<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> fact<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.330> Chavez<00:02:22.840> Jr<00:02:22.870> has<00:02:23.260> had

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
due to the fact that Chavez Jr has had

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.700 
due to the fact that Chavez Jr has had

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
operates and that's probably what's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.950

gonna happen in this fight um I think
Brian<00:02:53.470> Barrett<00:02:53.710> can<00:02:53.950> frustrate<00:02:54.190> him<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:54.820> I

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
Brian Barrett can frustrate him I do I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.370 
Brian Barrett can frustrate him I do I
don't<00:02:55.330> think<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.600> gonna<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.020> shutout

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
don't think this is gonna be a shutout

don't think this is gonna be a shutout
um<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:59.320> know<00:02:59.470> i<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.830> brian<00:03:00.250> vera<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> game

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
um you know i think brian vera is a game

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840 
um you know i think brian vera is a game
opponent<00:03:01.930> uh<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:03.370> know<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.520> think<00:03:03.580> he's<00:03:03.820> a

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
opponent uh you know I think he's a

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.100 
opponent uh you know I think he's a
pretty<00:03:04.060> game<00:03:04.270> opponent<00:03:04.690> he's<00:03:04.840> got<00:03:05.050> power<00:03:05.320> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
pretty game opponent he's got power and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.470 
pretty game opponent he's got power and
he's<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.370> some<00:03:09.370> tools<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.880> his<00:03:10.000> own<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.210> he's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
he's got some tools of his own that he's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720 
he's got some tools of his own that he's
gonna<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.690> able<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.960> use<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.380> fight<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.370> I

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
gonna be able to use in this fight so I

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.670 
gonna be able to use in this fight so I
think<00:03:13.390> he<00:03:13.630> can't<00:03:13.840> make<00:03:13.960> a<00:03:14.020> fight<00:03:14.260> out<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.470> it

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
think he can't make a fight out of it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.050 
think he can't make a fight out of it
and<00:03:14.890> like<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.280> said<00:03:15.340> when<00:03:15.610> you're<00:03:15.730> dealing<00:03:15.880> with

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
and like I said when you're dealing with

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
and like I said when you're dealing with
somebody<00:03:16.360> like<00:03:16.780> Chavez<00:03:17.110> who<00:03:17.410> doesn't<00:03:17.740> have<00:03:17.830> a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
somebody like Chavez who doesn't have a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.230 
somebody like Chavez who doesn't have a
good<00:03:18.040> defense<00:03:18.190> you're<00:03:18.610> always<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:18.940> had<00:03:19.060> that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
good defense you're always and had that

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.140 
good defense you're always and had that
chance<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.800> thing<00:03:21.070> about<00:03:21.100> Chavez<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.910> he

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
chance but the thing about Chavez is he

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 
chance but the thing about Chavez is he
has<00:03:22.240> such<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.780> weight<00:03:23.020> advantage<00:03:23.170> over<00:03:23.650> these

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
has such a weight advantage over these

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.370 
has such a weight advantage over these
guys<00:03:24.160> it's<00:03:25.030> almost<00:03:25.300> impossible<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.930> hurt<00:03:26.200> him

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
guys it's almost impossible to hurt him

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.440 
guys it's almost impossible to hurt him
you<00:03:26.530> know<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:26.860> sergio<00:03:27.610> martinez<00:03:28.000> kind<00:03:28.390> of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
you know and sergio martinez kind of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.020 
you know and sergio martinez kind of
found<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.840> out<00:03:28.990> I<00:03:29.020> mean<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.440> took<00:03:29.850> Sergio<00:03:30.850> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
found that out I mean it took Sergio the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.990 
found that out I mean it took Sergio the
whole<00:03:31.330> fight<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:32.430> guess<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.550> kind<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.820> slow

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
whole fight I guess the kind of slow

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.630 
whole fight I guess the kind of slow
shop<00:03:34.240> is<00:03:34.450> down<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.140> guess<00:03:35.470> he<00:03:35.920> kind<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.340> even

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
shop is down and I guess he kind of even

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.430 
shop is down and I guess he kind of even
really<00:03:36.880> didn't<00:03:37.209> slow<00:03:37.420> Chavez<00:03:37.840> down<00:03:38.020> because

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
really didn't slow Chavez down because

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.610 
really didn't slow Chavez down because
Chavez<00:03:39.400> was<00:03:39.550> still<00:03:39.880> able<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:41.020> knock<00:03:41.200> him<00:03:41.440> down

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
Chavez was still able to knock him down

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.979 
Chavez was still able to knock him down
you<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.520> in<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.940> last<00:03:43.060> round<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.840> just

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
you know in the last round so it just

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.600 
you know in the last round so it just
