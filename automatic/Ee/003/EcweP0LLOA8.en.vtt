just take that and divide it into three

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.330 
just take that and divide it into three
parts<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> would<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> normal<00:00:56.910> braid

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340

so like that and then just start

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
so like that and then just start
braiding

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:25.350 

to<00:01:13.180> do

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
snake braid thi look wait just spread it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.190 
snake braid thi look wait just spread it
out<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> bit<00:02:12.310> more<00:02:14.220> class<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:19.810> see

out a bit more class so if you can see

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.949 
out a bit more class so if you can see
that<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.810> how<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.590> snake<00:02:24.040> braid<00:02:24.400> looks

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
taking a bobby pin i'm just going to pin

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:51.060 
taking a bobby pin i'm just going to pin
that<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:45.120> there<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.440> snake

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
that and there you go so that is snake
