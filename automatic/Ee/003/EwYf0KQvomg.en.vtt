crochet one into the center of the loop

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.610 
crochet one into the center of the loop
so<00:01:41.100> we'll<00:01:41.310> wrap<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.970> yarn<00:01:42.000> around<00:01:42.620> we'll

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
so we'll wrap the yarn around we'll

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.520 
so we'll wrap the yarn around we'll
insert<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.190> hook<00:01:44.400> into<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.210> middle<00:01:45.660> of<00:01:45.840> our

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
insert the hook into the middle of our

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.430 
insert the hook into the middle of our
loop<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:50.010> then<00:01:50.550> we're<00:01:50.730> going<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.240> wrap<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
loop and then we're going to wrap the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.740 
loop and then we're going to wrap the
yarn<00:01:52.470> around<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.370> hook<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:54.740> pull<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:57.480> yarn

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
yarn around the hook again pull the yarn

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.860 
yarn around the hook again pull the yarn
through<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.140> center<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> loop<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.870> then

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
through the center of the loop and then

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.400 
through the center of the loop and then
we're<00:02:01.050> going<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.610> yarn<00:02:02.610> over<00:02:03.380> pull<00:02:04.380> through

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
we're going to yarn over pull through

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.120 
we're going to yarn over pull through
the<00:02:04.770> first<00:02:05.070> two<00:02:05.400> stitches<00:02:06.350> yarn<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
the first two stitches yarn over and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.280 
the first two stitches yarn over and
pull<00:02:08.330> through<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.690> second<00:02:10.140> two<00:02:10.170> stitches<00:02:11.240> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
pull through the second two stitches and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.670 
pull through the second two stitches and
we're<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.770> repeat<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.530> many

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
we're going to repeat that for as many

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.180 
we're going to repeat that for as many
times<00:02:17.100> as<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.610> our<00:02:17.760> pattern<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> for<00:02:20.100> this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
times as in our pattern so for this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.160 
times as in our pattern so for this
pattern<00:02:20.640> we're<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.940> 14<00:02:23.940> times

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.020 

now<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:29.120> go<00:02:29.300> around<00:02:29.800> we<00:02:30.800> have<00:02:31.010> our<00:02:31.340> tail

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
now as we go around we have our tail

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.839 
now as we go around we have our tail
here<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.599> we<00:02:32.720> want<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.230> weave<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.459> an<00:02:34.610> easy

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
here that we want to weave in so an easy

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.660 
here that we want to weave in so an easy
way<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.120> do<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.069> carry<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.370> tail

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
way to do that is to carry the tail

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.949 
way to do that is to carry the tail
along<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.560> edge<00:02:39.770> of<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.250> loop<00:02:40.550> as<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.660> double

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
along the edge of the loop as we double

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.520 
along the edge of the loop as we double
crochet<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:44.209> will<00:02:44.390> happen<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.260> dump

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
crochet and what will happen is the dump

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.460 
crochet and what will happen is the dump
the<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:47.090> tail<00:02:47.360> will<00:02:47.959> get<00:02:48.310> sewn<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:50.319> to<00:02:51.319> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
the the tail will get sewn in to the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.640 
the the tail will get sewn in to the
crocheting<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.459> go<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> let's<00:02:54.350> do<00:02:54.530> this

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
crocheting as we go so let's do this

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.140 
crocheting as we go so let's do this
again<00:02:54.920> we're<00:02:55.100> going<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.430> wrap<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.120> yarn

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
again we're going to wrap the yarn

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.199 
again we're going to wrap the yarn
around<00:02:56.390> for<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:56.989> double<00:02:57.260> crochet<00:02:58.030> we're<00:02:59.030> going

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
around for a double crochet we're going

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.699 
around for a double crochet we're going
to<00:02:59.300> insert<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.930> hook<00:03:00.110> into<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:01.280> center<00:03:02.709> wrap

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
to insert the hook into the center wrap

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.210 
to insert the hook into the center wrap
the<00:03:03.950> yarn<00:03:03.980> around<00:03:04.459> again<00:03:06.069> we're<00:03:07.069> going<00:03:07.160> to

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the yarn around again we're going to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.520 
the yarn around again we're going to
make<00:03:07.310> sure<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.880> tale<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.840> on<00:03:09.170> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
make sure that this tale is on the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.840 
make sure that this tale is on the
outside<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.239> hook

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
outside of the hook

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.390 
outside of the hook
so<00:03:13.060> wrap<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.420> yarn<00:03:13.450> around<00:03:13.660> pull<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.190> yarn

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
so wrap the yarn around pull the yarn

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.640 
so wrap the yarn around pull the yarn
through<00:03:17.370> yarn<00:03:18.370> over<00:03:19.020> pull<00:03:20.020> through<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.380> first
