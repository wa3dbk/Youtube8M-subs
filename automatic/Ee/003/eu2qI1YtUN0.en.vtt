so<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:33.000> thing<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.270> learned<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:34.080> probably

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so one thing I learned was I probably

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.860 
so one thing I learned was I probably
set<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.100> jaw<00:02:35.310> jacker<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.790> little<00:02:36.150> bit<00:02:36.300> too<00:02:36.540> tight

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.290 
set my jaw jacker a little bit too tight
I<00:02:37.080> should<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.410> loosened<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.800> tension<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> bit

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
I should have loosened the tension a bit

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.120 
I should have loosened the tension a bit
cuz<00:02:39.300> eventually<00:02:39.810> he<00:02:39.990> does<00:02:40.230> get<00:02:40.500> hooked<00:02:40.800> here

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
