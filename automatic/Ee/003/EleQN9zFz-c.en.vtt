00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.340
 tiscali them just before the shark approaches, I move and this is the only one 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.589
 deterrent that I used ebay thankfully it worked 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.980
 free these animals have never seen men at sea 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.659
 so they will try to understand what is happening on the net 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.760
 news if you pull on your knees and get smaller 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.010
 the animal gets closer and closer votes will try to understand what it is for 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.100
 bsk we are trying to get these creatures to earn theirs 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 trust - stars 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.160
 they are very curious animals, they will try to understand who you are very much 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.650
 quietly shooting 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.970
 but you understand that you are afraid of the wolf being a prey then will not hesitate to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.330
 press the trigger and it will try to neutralize mantova 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 Dear 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.740
 think how you see your credit body of possession of the animal notices it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.400
 immediately download you wanted cinecity because you are the one that women 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.120
 watch when the shark arrives causes go look for the towers - plateau a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.030
 propulsion but expropriation most likely if you had stopped by 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.860
 in front of the shark we would have retired and what we do instead 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.859
 in short, if you look at a gun, you see that that is enough 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.509
 nothing at all nothing 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.599
 now it turns around 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.090
 Sergio only dismissed the rifle between the two to explain this happens when 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.470
 he sees something close to evenings he makes artisans in the visual field but then he approaches 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.559
 and fabio audi a sampeyre and this is where you come from 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.719
 from that point text is drawn back 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.790
 nanopress now head north I like the animal too far 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.589
 text is approaching now the sauce moments in the animal immediately starts looking 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.450
 the reason for this is sky which is the only thing the animal recognizes 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.810
 as typical of each prey a movement of pine yes immediately he moves photo 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.419
 displacement subcommittee by htc touch this what the animal hears 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.239
 try to check 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.349
 if so when you are dealing with a man shark interaction know how to stay 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.349
 firm and very very important lucio 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:25.659
 after the shark has almost severed a piece of his fin ralph he decides that 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.189
 it's much safer to get back on the boat 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.799
 Michael the ball to calm the shark Hey stays with him in the water 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.659
 now the creature is very curious to apparently want to interact with 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:38.749
 yet 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.489
 b result is something that probably no one has ever managed to 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.079
 do with a great white shark from now on let's open your mouth for the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:47.949
 first time 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.899
 it is a male specimen 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:52.989
 true strength 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.989
 ca 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.439
 with this shark it was the first time we went there we didn't know about his 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.150
 version 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.410
 but he who did not like the Tosca very much - do you think he went away and then returned 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.120
 camping years as you see is coming towards me with your mouth open you are rather 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.900
 enraged hunting england started he is saying that I know it too 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.789
 I too am angry monkey who will do the same is this that 620 them 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.680
 but there is no physical contact, you can only stop it by moving your neck here 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.870
 not sure english way now i'm going to him faster here 

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.869
 I move again and as soon as the shark changes direction I move towards it 

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:33.620
 he and how they say it is done 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.180
 hey me too so when I get legal I too am strong we must 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.640
 realize that these animals have an excellent director of organs 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.400
 very efficient sensory and sensitivity to moving from here 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.660
 only what you see is a sauce that is making movements rather 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.550
 broken and very noisy for a shark itself in this way the animal 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.230
 if vogue stays away this kind of thing scares sharks a lot 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.229
 ok here we see it again 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.409
 paris this is a very aggressive movement for this creature i am the 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.270
 same important thing that the scholars know a very limited series of 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.620
 situations in which they are able to best use their sensory organs for 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.289
 not being able to approach strangely housed are not the rocks 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.409
 on the other hand we humans have the technology and all kinds of 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.659
 means to analyze chieri analyzing these kinds of situations anyway 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.369
 in the end find the right answer or at least sex the correct way 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.059
 to react
