00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.640
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.490
 welcome to a new video of ward the 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.139
 grains the next expansion of 14 in 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.799
 this video I will talk a little about the 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.799
 new or improved mission system 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.110
 of flight fourth good now tighten 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.210
 the key mo the key l in word of 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.550
 warcraft shows us the same map panel 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.600
 and mission registration now when by 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.740
 example let's go to world 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.880
 let's see all our missions 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.680
 ordered by the area where 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 complete the mission and for example the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.900
 we go to the glacial fire crest that is 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.329
 the first zone of the horde between not 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.610
 the zone appears and all the missions 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.650
 what we can do here here appears 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 also the progress of the story now 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.270
 apart from all the missions that we can 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 find there will be several various missions 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.610
 or see several chapters that are going to 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.760
 serve as a tour in the history of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.860
 the dragon we have here the progress of 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.090
 the story 2 of 6 in this case and then 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.399
 as we complete the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.649
 chapters we will learn more about 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.170
 the history of this area in reference to 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.560
 bring these chapters of history we 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.689
 we'll go 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.670
 as we complete the missions that 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.140
 belong that chapter in this case 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.520
 these two here and here we have the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.720
 support to the citadel which are the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.760
 missions of the citadel 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.260
 I imagine that by completing each of the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.600
 History chapters of all areas 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.040
 of aenor then we will go up to level 100 but 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.990
 force the wanted add a new 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.640
 characteristic called objectives of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 bonus the objectives of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.380
 bonus are missions that we 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 appear or unlock when 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
 we reach a certain area of ​​the map 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.750
 at that moment it appears to us that we have 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.480
 discovered a new goal of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.520
 bonus and we appear a couple of 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.170
 objectives that we have to meet in that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.150
 small area really is not so 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 surprise is not or go to a new 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.360
 bonus objective but in the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.190
 map tells us where they are then 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.200
 we went to that area when we 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.880
 we can not do the missions when 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 we need gold or just when we 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 like to see that they send us over there and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.040
 they are going to send us a few 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.040
 objectives a pair to make 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
 the bonus objectives are for 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.340
 as well as some events in quotation marks 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.140
 of the world will be to reach an area and that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.120
 do not jump different goals to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.540
 perform something like in guild wars 2 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.880
 when we go to an area and we go to a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.160
 heart in that heart sent us 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.709
 certain activities to do and I did not 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.630
 it's not even necessary to talk to a mpc to get the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.410
 mission or talk to an npc for 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.410
 return the mission 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.770
 for example in this case in this 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.230
 bonus objective demand two 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.600
 things on the one hand kill a few euros and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.390
 on the other release some wolves 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.160
 when I complete these two objectives 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.110
 in this case it is book because 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.820
 complete one and a half as finished 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.800
 the the objective but good when 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.800
 let's complete the two, they will give us the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 Gold reward and experience 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.159
 this is another example in the same area 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 but another bonus goal 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.099
 I have to save some allies 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.030
 thaw some allies and kill some in 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.030
 species that exist in this area 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.170
 In addition to the bonus objectives 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.730
 we also find treasures treasures 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.160
 they are also part of the content 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.810
 optional and they consist of how you see 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.580
 here an object that awakens my 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.560
 curiosity I read him and suddenly 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.450
 they appear a lot of bugs that I have 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.250
 to kill once I get rid of them 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.590
 I am rewarded with a new item 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.590
 that looks like it improves me so perfect 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.620
 and to finish also an aspect 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.480
 quite interesting now is that the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.550
 missions when they give you an item of 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.950
 reward this item can be green 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 can be blue or this can be epic 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.970
 depends on a pro of a probability 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.530
 how good is it there and if when 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.160
 we complete a mission the item that we 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.020
 It gives that peak for better than better 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.450
 and nothing else for now pretty people 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.440
 curious the new televeo system the 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.880
 new features 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.370
 leave me in the comments what do you think 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.010
 its similarity also with other games that 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.600
 they have been dating lately and then nothing 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.600
 see you the next video see you later
