00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
face would you like to do a pattern or a

face would you like to do a pattern or a
pin<00:00:58.559> either<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.100> works<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> go

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
pin either one works I'm going to go

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.970 
pin either one works I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> pattern<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
ahead and do a pattern so I'm going to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
ahead and do a pattern so I'm going to
go<00:01:02.070> ahead<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.460> draw<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> pattern<00:01:03.019> real

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
go ahead and just draw a pattern real

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
go ahead and just draw a pattern real
quick<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> confirm<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:06.540> be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
quick and confirm it so that would be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
quick and confirm it so that would be
for<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.500> reason<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.920> dark<00:01:08.220> light<00:01:08.490> or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
for some reason you're in dark light or

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.609 
for some reason you're in dark light or
something<00:01:09.360> basically<00:01:09.990> you'll<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.380> able<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
something basically you'll be able to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.969 
something basically you'll be able to
use<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> pattern<00:01:12.689> instead<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.710> let's<00:01:13.860> go

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
use your the pattern instead so let's go

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.190 
use your the pattern instead so let's go
ahead<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> try<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.030> gonna<00:01:15.479> lock<00:01:15.960> my

and unlock the phone I'm ready to go

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.230 
and unlock the phone I'm ready to go
let's<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.799> ahead<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.979> pop<00:01:26.220> turn<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.880> one

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
let's go ahead and pop turn that on one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
let's go ahead and pop turn that on one
more<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> takes<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
more as you can see it takes just a

you'll see I mean it is really really
really<00:01:37.200> good<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.729> being<00:01:38.729> sensitive<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
really good at being sensitive as you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
really good at being sensitive as you
can<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.659> i'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.950> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
can see i'm going to not know in this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
can see i'm going to not know in this
one<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.909> says<00:01:42.090> could<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.329> recognize

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
your face so then you just draw your
design<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> made<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
design that you made and you can just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
design that you made and you can just
kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.189> pop<00:01:47.490> through<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.020> i'm

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
kind of pop through as you can see i'm

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
kind of pop through as you can see i'm
going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> pop<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.240> still<00:01:51.540> says

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
going to pop in and it still says

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.030 
going to pop in and it still says
couldn't<00:01:51.990> find<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> face<00:01:52.619> let's<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.860> ahead<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
couldn't find a face let's go ahead and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.030 
couldn't find a face let's go ahead and
try<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.250> once<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.770> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
try that once more and there you go so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.469 
try that once more and there you go so
it<00:01:56.130> works<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:57.149> i'm<00:01:57.450> very

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it works very well actually i'm very

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
it works very well actually i'm very
surprised<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.729> bit

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
surprised just you get that little bit

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.340 
surprised just you get that little bit
of<00:01:59.969> lag<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> front-facing<00:02:00.840> camera<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of lag for the front-facing camera to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
of lag for the front-facing camera to
turn<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> starts<00:02:02.490> black<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.060> i<00:02:03.090> mean<00:02:03.299> overall

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
turn on starts black but i mean overall

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
turn on starts black but i mean overall
it<00:02:04.290> works<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:04.860> well<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:06.000> really

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it works very well so you don't really

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
it works very well so you don't really
have<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.479> lag<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.469> pretty

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
have much lag there and it's it's pretty

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
have much lag there and it's it's pretty
secure<00:02:08.209> from<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.360> i<00:02:09.390> hear<00:02:09.539> though<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> can

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
secure from what i hear though you can

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
secure from what i hear though you can
put<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> picture<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.979> yourself<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
put a picture of yourself up to it and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
put a picture of yourself up to it and
it<00:02:12.120> will<00:02:12.989> unlock

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it will unlock

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.040 
it will unlock
so<00:02:14.160> keep<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.970> mind<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.660> kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so keep that in mind so it's kind of a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.380 
so keep that in mind so it's kind of a
low-security<00:02:16.440> thing<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.340> regards<00:02:18.240> but

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
low-security thing in that regards but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.330 
low-security thing in that regards but
