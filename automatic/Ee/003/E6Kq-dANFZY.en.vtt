that's good I kind of disagree with that
ruling<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.420> thing<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:06.630> basically<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> like

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
ruling of thing will basically have like

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.210 
ruling of thing will basically have like
two<00:01:07.710> field<00:01:08.010> spells<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.520> gates<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.150> um

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
two field spells like gates or um

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.500 
two field spells like gates or um
whatever<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.460> called<00:01:11.580> scred'<00:01:12.060> spell<00:01:12.360> book

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
whatever it's called scred' spell book

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.210 
whatever it's called scred' spell book
tower<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:13.020> necrovalley<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.799> gates<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
tower like necrovalley and gates on the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
tower like necrovalley and gates on the
field<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> same<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.689> pretty<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
field at the same time that's pretty it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
field at the same time that's pretty it
doesn't<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.520> any<00:01:17.580> sense<00:01:18.030> because

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
doesn't really make any sense because

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
doesn't really make any sense because
it's<00:01:18.390> supposed<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> field<00:01:19.170> spell<00:01:19.350> for

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it's supposed to be a field spell for

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
it's supposed to be a field spell for
the<00:01:19.680> reason<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.549> take<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> entire

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the reason so i can take up the entire

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.230 
the reason so i can take up the entire
field<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.280> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.700> pathetic

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
field so that's kind of a pathetic

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
field so that's kind of a pathetic
ruling<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.740> ruling<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> your<00:01:26.580> opponent

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
ruling but the ruling that your opponent

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
ruling but the ruling that your opponent
can<00:01:27.360> only<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:28.049> cannot<00:01:28.500> draw<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.220> go

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can only can cannot draw if they go

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.520 
can only can cannot draw if they go
first<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:30.299> right<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> cannot<00:01:31.170> draw<00:01:31.409> if

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
first all right now you cannot draw if

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.760 
first all right now you cannot draw if
you<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.740> first<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.659> Japan<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> pretty
