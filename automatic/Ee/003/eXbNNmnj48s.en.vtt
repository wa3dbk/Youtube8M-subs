 there is fashion well, fashion and peculiar 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.110
 concept i'm big leaning against the walls 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 because style and above all on 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.190
 man, he opens it 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.619

 thai style everything is so deep i'm so 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 I never thought deeply 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.170
 your nose and consider what fashion really is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.460
 In fact, all people are beautiful on their own 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.780
 outwardly if not to care for yourself but to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.950
 it will emphasize not to hide your 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.960
 inner beauty needed 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.090

 Agree set reading is always a warehouse 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.739
 develops how a person is dressed 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.420
 accordingly, even if we are beautiful 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.890
 inside but we won't emphasize it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.130
 our outer shell 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.160
