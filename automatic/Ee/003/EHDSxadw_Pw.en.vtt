00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
the other eye so as a patient as a user

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.300 
the other eye so as a patient as a user
the<00:01:20.329> only<00:01:20.600> way<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:20.810> properly<00:01:21.409> play<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.039> game

the<00:01:37.280> user<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.929> players<00:01:39.139> are<00:01:39.380> actually

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
the user so the players are actually

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.249

using<00:01:40.039> 3d<00:01:40.490> glasses<00:01:40.819> to<00:01:41.359> see<00:01:41.389> the<00:01:41.689> images<00:01:42.109> on

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
using 3d glasses to see the images on

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.410 
using 3d glasses to see the images on
the<00:01:42.289> screen<00:01:42.439> yeah<00:01:43.159> for<00:01:43.490> medical<00:01:43.880> purposes

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
the screen yeah for medical purposes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.410 
the screen yeah for medical purposes
it's<00:01:44.659> easier<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:46.100> use<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.490> tablet<00:01:46.729> as<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.240> now

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's easier to use a tablet as of now

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.879 
it's easier to use a tablet as of now
using<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.560> game<00:01:49.009> with<00:01:49.459> black<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.119> white

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
using a game with black and white

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.919 
using a game with black and white
backgrounds<00:01:51.889> with<00:01:52.039> tones<00:01:52.249> of<00:01:52.429> gray<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:52.929> only

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
backgrounds with tones of gray and only

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.499 
backgrounds with tones of gray and only
interactive<00:01:54.859> ingredients<00:01:55.490> are<00:01:55.639> either<00:01:56.149> blue

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
interactive ingredients are either blue

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.929 
interactive ingredients are either blue
or<00:01:56.749> red<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.069> that's<00:01:58.310> how<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:58.459> were<00:01:58.670> able<00:01:58.909> to

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
or red so that's how I were able to

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.839 
or red so that's how I were able to
target<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.599> balance<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:00.799> ingredients<00:02:01.609> so<00:02:01.789> to

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
target and balance the ingredients so to

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.120 
target and balance the ingredients so to
make<00:02:02.209> the<00:02:02.450> therapy<00:02:03.380> as<00:02:03.469> efficient<00:02:03.979> as

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
make the therapy as efficient as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.089 
make the therapy as efficient as
possible<00:02:04.599> so<00:02:05.599> physicians<00:02:06.109> are<00:02:06.560> actually<00:02:06.709> able

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
possible so physicians are actually able

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.339 
possible so physicians are actually able
to<00:02:07.279> kind<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.789> customize<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.720> settings<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
to kind of customize the settings in the

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.170 
to kind of customize the settings in the
