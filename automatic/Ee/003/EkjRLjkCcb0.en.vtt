were<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.830> lot<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.099> unanswered<00:00:11.490> questions<00:00:11.700> that

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
were a lot of unanswered questions that

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.180 
were a lot of unanswered questions that
will<00:00:12.870> finally<00:00:13.080> answered<00:00:13.590> by<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.769> theory<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
will finally answered by the theory of

will finally answered by the theory of
plate<00:00:14.429> tectonics<00:00:15.260> however<00:00:16.430> there<00:00:17.430> were<00:00:17.580> many

plate tectonics however there were many

wanted how similar animal fossils were
