00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello youtube I hope you are very 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.509
 well in this video I will talk about the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.550
 new generation of macbook pros and there 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.590
 max 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.350
 this is a subject from which I have received 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.780
 quite a few messages lately and so 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.970
 general your question is the same I want 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.610
 buy me a mac computer should I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 wait for me or better I buy it and how much 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.680
 missing for the new generation to leave 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 of macbook pros and amex and as it is usually 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.759
 with all the support products 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.130
 nobody can know exactly when 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.620
 one of your products will be renewed so 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 general are always rumors the good is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 that in many occasions the majority of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.519
 they are true and I will start by 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 mention the probable departure date of 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.140
 these renewed equipment all the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 rumors suggest that it will be on 23 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 April although knowing poe no me 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.429
 would be surprised that they will delay it until the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.230
 first or second week of May so 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.480
 If you are thinking of buying a new one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.699
 Mac computer and you do not need it with 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.800
 urgency at this time expect some 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.929
 days usually the cycle of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 renovation of computers appo is 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.210
 of a year a little more or a little less so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.940
 this rumor must be very close to the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.820
 another important aspect will be the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.560
 improvements that these new equipment will have 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.900
 processor that will feature this new 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.300
 line of computers will be the intel of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 I do not want to get bridge much 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.020
 technical details of this processor 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
 not to bore you but something very 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.970
 important is that the int the bridge is a 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.430
 processor that spends less battery for 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.680
 exercise its operation this maybe 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 does not matter much in the imacs but in 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.420
 the macbook pros this new processor 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.369
 help to generate a longer time of use 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 which is fundamental in a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.080
 laptop obviously also 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.729
 we will see better results in 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.649
 As for speed and performance , 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.110
 refers to each of these new 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.000
 equipment and thanks to this new 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.009
 processor we will also have 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 better graphics this helps 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.690
 mainly to the macbook pro of 13 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.820
 inches which do not have a gpu 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.640
 dedicated specifically to your graphics 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.009
 and for those who do not know gpu is the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.500
 abbreviation of graphics processing units 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.320
 and this means unity of process of 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.630
 graphics there are some other rumors 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.390
 although these are already more focused on 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.370
 aesthetic part of the product is mentioned 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 that the macbook pros could have a 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 more design 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 and similar to the macbook air and one of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.379
 the strongest rumors and that in what 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.420
 I would love it to be true 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.510
 is that all these new computers 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.849
 will have retina display and given that 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.489
 the new ipad has this I do not see 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.010
 so far this possibility imagine 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.400
 a macbook pro or an imac with retina 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.599
 display would be something impressive 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.190
 mainly higher the size 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.200
 from the screen 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.170
 before finishing I want to remind you that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.120
 all these are just rumors let me know 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 in the comments what is your opinion to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.069
 respect about the departure of the new 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.230
 macbook pros hi max and I know that always 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.390
 they were mentioned by facebook and twitter 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.640
 but thank you very much for supporting me
