anti-gravity
I<00:01:31.579> mean<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.729> decent<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.689> probably

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
I mean it's decent but but probably

I mean it's decent but but probably
could've<00:01:34.200> done<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
could've done more of it and that the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.889 
could've done more of it and that the
things<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.009> could<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.250> done<00:01:38.479> with<00:01:39.479> battle

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
things they could have done with battle

mode<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.289> anti-gravity<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.880> boggles

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
mode and anti-gravity it just boggles

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.969 
mode and anti-gravity it just boggles
the<00:01:42.360> mind<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.289> like<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the mind that they kind of like the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
the mind that they kind of like the
bed<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:44.970> did<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.330> bowel<00:01:45.539> mode

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bed as much as they did with bowel mode

bed as much as they did with bowel mode
I<00:01:46.020> even<00:01:46.200> tried<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.310> kind<00:01:47.759> of
