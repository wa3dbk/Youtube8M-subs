headphones nowadays it's this awesome
folding<00:03:03.790> design<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.020> just<00:03:05.140> fold<00:03:05.320> them<00:03:05.410> up

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
folding design we can just fold them up

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.100 
folding design we can just fold them up
then<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.070> so<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.340> easier<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.790> carry<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.930> also

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
really can see this on camera but

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.499 
really can see this on camera but
they've<00:04:56.319> actually<00:04:56.469> got<00:04:56.770> brushed<00:04:57.129> aluminium

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509

on<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.919> tips<00:04:59.919> of<00:05:00.189> the<00:05:00.400> headphone<00:05:01.060> cable<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.680> I

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
on the tips of the headphone cable so I

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.589 
on the tips of the headphone cable so I
think<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.009> just<00:05:03.129> looks<00:05:03.490> really<00:05:03.669> partial<00:05:04.060> it

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599

think that just looks really partial it
gives<00:05:04.900> quite<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.169> lot<00:05:05.319> of<00:05:05.409> quality<00:05:06.189> to<00:05:06.370> the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460
