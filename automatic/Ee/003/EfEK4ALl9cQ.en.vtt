00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740

 The most bizarre couples in game world 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.830
 and then I thought about doing a part 2 more 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 Then I thought better and decided to speak 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 about some tragic cases I promise 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.910
 try to limit the number of Spaniards to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.859
 maximum but you know it happens in the right 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 Our first couple of traffic today is the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.440

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 because she dies at the end of the first cd 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.370
 of the hospital and the clÃ¡udio and kind of never 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 outweighs this even more by the way 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 erik buell since she told me that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.719

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.520
 chance of survival 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.219
 unfortunately the album as ugly people 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.530
 new was the offer he secured between him 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 and never really got over it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 despite having followed with acuity 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 edict and her memory continues with him 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 two because after all the life of the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.210
 human beings who were being attacked by 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.460
 bucks 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.890
 and this is one of the most 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.780
 strong of the game, right? 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.810
 one of the most emotional scenes of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 technology and certainly deserves a place 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.970

 to know if she revived not only by playing 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.280
 a place on the list also because 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.900
