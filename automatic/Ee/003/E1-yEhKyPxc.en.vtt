00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
as Marty said what the hell is a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.180 
as Marty said what the hell is a
teraflop<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> xbox<00:02:05.620> is<00:02:05.800> meant<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.070> have

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
teraflop but the xbox is meant to have

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.669 
teraflop but the xbox is meant to have
more<00:02:06.340> memory<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.909> therefore<00:02:07.810> some<00:02:08.560> of

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
more memory and therefore some of

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.440 
more memory and therefore some of
smacking<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.280> ps4<00:02:09.580> when<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:09.940> go<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> point

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
smacking the ps4 when we go so the point

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.320 
smacking the ps4 when we go so the point
is<00:02:10.660> as<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.709> every<00:02:12.130> generation<00:02:12.520> we've<00:02:13.180> never

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is as with every generation we've never

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.250 
is as with every generation we've never
been<00:02:13.450> able<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.660> tell<00:02:13.840> which<00:02:13.990> was<00:02:14.140> more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
been able to tell which was more

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.470 
been able to tell which was more
powerful<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:15.340> assuming<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.940> ps3<00:02:16.330> with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
powerful I'm assuming that the ps3 with

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
powerful I'm assuming that the ps3 with
more<00:02:16.600> powerful<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.020> xbox<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.100> xbox

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
more powerful in the xbox but the xbox

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.210 
more powerful in the xbox but the xbox
will<00:02:18.580> be<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> better<00:02:18.910> experience<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:20.100> really<00:02:21.100> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
will be a better experience and really a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.949 
will be a better experience and really a
lot<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> games<00:02:21.610> will<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.940> developed<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
lot of games will be developed on a

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.080 
lot of games will be developed on a
separate<00:02:23.350> sheet<00:02:23.770> my<00:02:23.980> pc<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.670> don't<00:02:24.940> read

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
separate sheet my pc and then don't read

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.330 
separate sheet my pc and then don't read
it<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.630> consoles<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.860> i've<00:02:27.010> always<00:02:27.250> been

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
it to the consoles as i've always been

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.070 
it to the consoles as i've always been
this<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.390> we're<00:02:28.600> not<00:02:28.690> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.900> see

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
this so really we're not going to see

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.740 
this so really we're not going to see
much<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:30.250> difference<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.630> performance

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
much of a difference in the performance

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.960 
much of a difference in the performance
not<00:02:32.740> yet<00:02:33.040> takes<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.400> few<00:02:33.520> years<00:02:33.670> for<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
not yet takes a few years for that to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.580 
not yet takes a few years for that to
kick<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.510> guess<00:02:34.750> what<00:02:34.959> I'm<00:02:35.050> saying<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.440> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
kick in I guess what I'm saying is that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.990 
kick in I guess what I'm saying is that
era<00:02:35.860> flops<00:02:36.070> don't<00:02:36.280> mean<00:02:36.400> jack<00:02:36.610> right<00:02:36.850> now

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
era flops don't mean jack right now

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720 
era flops don't mean jack right now
however<00:02:37.930> some<00:02:38.320> sources<00:02:38.709> are<00:02:39.010> talking<00:02:39.430> about<00:02:39.520> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
however some sources are talking about a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.220 
however some sources are talking about a
rumored<00:02:40.590> 2013<00:02:41.590> launch<00:02:41.860> now<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:43.230> unlikely

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
rumored 2013 launch now that is unlikely

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470 
rumored 2013 launch now that is unlikely
thankfully<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.910> consoles<00:02:46.239> does

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
thankfully if one of the consoles does

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.660 
thankfully if one of the consoles does
hit<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> market<00:02:47.140> by<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.440> end<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.830> year<00:02:48.100> it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
hit the market by the end of the year it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.120 
hit the market by the end of the year it
will<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.880> very<00:02:49.090> tentative<00:02:49.780> kind<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
will be very tentative kind of in the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.310 
will be very tentative kind of in the
initial<00:02:51.340> initial<00:02:51.820> sort<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.300> release<00:02:52.750> with

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
initial initial sort of release with

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.960 
initial initial sort of release with
very<00:02:53.500> expenses<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.130> many<00:02:54.340> gamers<00:02:54.580> available

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
very expenses what many gamers available

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.330 
very expenses what many gamers available
for<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:55.989> suspect<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:56.920> Lee<00:02:57.070> kind<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.280> a

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
for it so I suspect that Lee kind of a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
for it so I suspect that Lee kind of a
sharp<00:02:57.700> thing<00:02:57.880> plus<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.239> may<00:02:58.540> need<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.930> buy<00:02:59.110> but

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
sharp thing plus up may need to buy but

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.190 
sharp thing plus up may need to buy but
like<00:02:59.709> when<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.040> first<00:03:00.280> came<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:00.910> mmm<00:03:01.870> but

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
like when we first came out so mmm but

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.960 
like when we first came out so mmm but
to<00:03:02.320> solve<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.709> one<00:03:02.769> however<00:03:03.550> when<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.700> ps4

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
to solve that one however when the ps4

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
to solve that one however when the ps4
does<00:03:04.360> camera<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.870> quite<00:03:05.019> obvious<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.350> it's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
does camera it's quite obvious that it's

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.090 
does camera it's quite obvious that it's
gonna<00:03:06.489> be<00:03:06.610> not<00:03:06.880> by<00:03:07.000> finished<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:08.049> ps3<00:03:08.680> web<00:03:08.890> and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
blu-ray so something like to get
