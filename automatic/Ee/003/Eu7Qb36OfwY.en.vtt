00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.889
 How high is the adrenalin level qualifying for the World Cup 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.079
 it's alright 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.209
 Core issue under pressure also stood in Russia 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.669
 Oberalpfen Bremer the non-voter commodities are very good on today again 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.219
 have dealt with it and have 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.279
 Ackermann took a class game that has always been one of them 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.249
 deciding opportunity used this summit rendezvous with all the drum and 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.330
 turn off place reference in outnumbered 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.479
 Penalty or not her goal 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.999
 yes I believe and and because it is in the game below 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 Although I do not believe that class player is on the course course 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 was difficult 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.120
 otherwise people will always be satisfied Mesut Ã¶sil the many problems 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.900
 the national association but 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.970
 when one of us then saw that we got along well and 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.540
 if I give him a trailer Canadians continue way 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.750
 the energy or 2 or 4 5 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.630
 Michael Ballack 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.790
 won the game of the year and thus also for the World Cup 2010 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.790
 qualifies for the peculiarities of the German game 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.670
 But we want it since you believed us today, we have it from the beginning 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.710
 Gretel played too little anyway but always played the lead up 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.830
 adjusted 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 and that's why I think this year too, the result will be as they are before the water 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.710
 pick up 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 How hard it was for Boateng to hold on to the yellow and red card 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 yes of course the pressure takes so clearly that especially if you see leads 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170
 that children through more they have then replaced with four strikers 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.150
 played 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.070
 Under the wheels, of course, you're under pressure for the first time 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.950
 less one knows where we are 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.200
 Philipp Lahm congratulations on winning the qualification was that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.960
 Masterpiece of this qualification 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 I think I'll be busy later on, everyone has joined the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.240
 tactical requirements kept the order was on it 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 if Russia had the sharp the senses net Panther Gravenreuth 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.390
 given up 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.340
 but we did well against it 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.820
 and Zora deserves to become German champion debutant unfortunately had early 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.110
 out we have vandals the last 20 minutes 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 here very hard Wide Web one knows how strong the Russians can be and then 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.590
 he ran hot either play everything or nothing they have done too 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.610
 but then brings in two strikers and then becomes more dangerous high at 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.460
 For 16 days, Bethge will be traitors and warmth over there very much 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.349
 good against it keep celebrating explained 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.010
 we have so far but next weekend the Bundeswehr is out 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.749
 Sevilla on 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.079
 who is with Finland 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.459
 yes he reported stormed Adeles qualified and I believe 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 The SPD wanted to thank Scherping for the posters 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.209
 but first of all, he congratulations I believe 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.970
 "It's like dreaming that you should play such an important game with one 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.069
 Lennart's outstanding impressive performance they have that with new 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.109
 would have thought 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.939
 that they have so much influence in their browser 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.849
 yes it was Sturms was already set very well you have to say you have to 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.799
 you can concentrate the week very well 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.519
 Yard or focused the whole team just felt that we got the thing 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 easier here in Moscow 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.649
 want to make it clear that people wanted to book the ticket for South Africa 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.599
 or as I said no player 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.379
 Erkheim no official has barely seen with nationwide broadcasters professionals 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.559
 and of course for me personally 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:06.499
 So delivering that is indeed made the dorm happy 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.739
 Although it should fail SAS wordless the most emotional player of my career 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.919
 and now with a view to the World Cup next year 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.719
 a huge plus punk made to be number one 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.469
 The question was what was wrong 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:20.490
 Can we check rifle but also questions 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.780
 another player 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.800
 like that he emphasized today that it does not matter at the moment 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.639
 or that it is not me before the game 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.049
 to present when buying Frankfurt episode from calls Oliver 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.159
 And since sometimes it helps to make it successful that was very good 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.099
 Thank you okay we watch
