00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.920
I have been researching the history of combs,
the wide variety of materials that combs have

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.160
been made out of throughout history including
shell, horn, and wood.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.440
I have developed a particular, particularly
I have developed an interest in wooden combs.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.390
I will have some wooden combs custom made,
I have some specific designs that I want in

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.520
wood, someone will be making them for me.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.670
In the meantime, I am using this wooden comb
from The Body Shop.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.640
I actually discovered that The Body Shop carries
this comb, wooden comb, I bought two of them,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.230
buy one get one half off I figured I needed
a couple of combs anyway that's actually why

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.601
I was searching online.

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.059
I went in and purchased them.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.090
I also believe they are available online.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.100
The lady in the store told me the will be
discontinued along with some other products

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.920
that she had in the area with these combs
she said she was not sure if these combs are

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.159
going to come back or what's going to replace
them, so...

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.959
I just bought the two combs I needed and that
was that but if someone is looking into wooden

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.289
combs interested in purchasing them perhaps
a phone call to the store to confirm that

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.880
they are still available, I don't know things
vary from state to state so I'm not sure how

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.419
that goes.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:38.899
The price, oh did I say the price?

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.380
It was under twelve dollar for both of them
and again I think it was some sort of deal.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.689
It was pretty decent.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.310
I combed my hair dry, a small amount of my
hair dry, the first thing I noticed is that

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.239
it amplified the sound of combing, it feels
like there is a microphone and some speakers

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.090
that are attached to the comb.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:09.220
I am able to hear very carefully what each
stroke sounds like, which I thought was very

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.220
interesting.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.209
It aided in a gentle technique for combing.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.329
I combed most of my hair wet in the shower
and then out of the shower with Kinky Curly

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.670
Curling Custard and some conditioner and it
worked pretty good.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.069
Very smooth, no scraping of my scalp.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:38.469
It would be difficult to be rough with this
comb, and for the most part over so many years

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:47.790
of me combing my own hair I have automatically
developed practices for gently handling my

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.739
hair.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.549
This comb I feel like it is even more delicate,
like there is less being done to my hair,

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.580
with the desired result.
