00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 love gaming friends my nam sirius and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.760
 this is the daily news today 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.480
 like star wars battlefront mass 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.030
 effect four waskönig best in the summer 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.180
 wolf homefront did full and what us 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.010
 still so will think so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 Unleashed the first few seconds of the daily 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 news is really my worst second 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 the passages are the most commonly I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 record where I just the themes of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.239
 daily news statement try to make a commitment 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 and paint a field that wanted that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 Did not want to and so it does not matter 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.030
 So first at this point right 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
 Thank you very much for your thumbs up 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.180
 support at the last episode of the daily 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.760
 news on sunday 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.910
 that was phenomenal yes so we have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 now about twice in a row 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 2500 thumbs up reached per daily 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 News follow that I think that's easy 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 I do not know that's awesome so that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 so many of you have been the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 thumbs up for the daily news 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.329
 I can just say it again 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.119
 thank you save the date said it for him 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.100
 in an e mail from bethesda in the them 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.170
 quite simply announced to all 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 first time on the e3 a showcase too 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 So make a kind of press conference 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 where to play then about future games 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
 the whole thing will be reported on 14 june 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.520
 take place this year and I think 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 it's pretty terrific so just the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.509
 fact that they have never been there before 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 indeed shows that this time they again 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.780
 want to trump and especially thick 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.850
 then not a small litter 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.009
 is coming and so now is the big question 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 most people are probably waiting 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.820
 new cheek and a lot of people 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 wait for new elder scrolls from me 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.720
 like to also like the scary at two 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.360
 I always call that one does not know it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 14 june this year at e3 so far 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240
 more if I get paid in flight 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.439
 I go there 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 otherwise we would be together 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.490
 somehow from home in the livestream the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.259
 watch press conference and you can 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.390
 Now write in the comments if it is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.140
 new cheeky or the new elder scrolls 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.940
 should be 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.730
 Alistair McNally that's the type of one 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 bioware montreal, so to speak 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.200
 has mass effect 4 as in the future 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 will look like everything has somehow 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.830
 nen others have but we simply say 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.810
 He continues to mass effect four and he 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.060
 just tweeted that he did 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.430
 to spend the whole evening with the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.470
 latest artwork to the new mass effect 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.459
 and he just can 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.890
 say where it is generations ahead and 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.740
 then I did not swell it out 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.260
 this artwork is allowed to announce 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.520
 played where we know what alistair 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 Mcnally meant that 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.720
 deep silver is still damned 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.950
 again at home already expressed two 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 the whole thing should not have followed 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.430
 that was originally at crytek uk in 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.120
 planning 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.220
 that was bought up by thq thq went 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 then broke and the game was sold 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.550
 to deep silver when i'm really in 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.080
 So head was there in any case 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.480
 quite a taste with the game in the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 apron already and that was not below 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.020
 especially cheap stars and now has 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.850
 the community manager of which 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.370
 again in the neogaf forum voiced that 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 the part would still be in work and 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.850
 that still still in this 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.400
 former crytek uk what now and 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.840
 as it belongs to deep silver 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.580
 it is further developed and edited 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.320
 At first it seemed as if that 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.430
 maybe such a flop development would be 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.020
 like prey 2 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.280
 what so now somehow long 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.630
 was developed and in the end somehow 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.350
 I have to quit now 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.570
 just confess 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.560
 The game is under a bad 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.570
 star 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.250
 yes so the developer team was down and 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.239
 the game pushed the trademark rights 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.100
 sold to here after I would do it 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.860
 I would like to see it in one 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.690
 but experience awesome cryengine quality 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.310
 I'm afraid that the thing somehow am 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.310
 maybe end up flopping 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.280
 the chief financial officer of 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.080
 electronic arts blake jorgensen has 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.350
 Now at a press conference in San 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.670
 francisco said that in the future shared 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.500
 probably also for the playstation 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.910
 he will come and he simply has 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.680
 said that they have not yet over 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.830
 another and upcoming part of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.750
 titan of officially speaking 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.160
 but that, of course, in the game 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.860
 last year only for the xbox brought 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.180
 But in the future, one essential 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.170
 bigger footprint with the second part 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.480
 So that means to leave behind 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.040
 quite simply that when titan of 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.630
 maybe two in development 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.940
 is not announced yet 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.040
 but then for multiple systems 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.290
 will appear and not xbox man 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.660
 Exclusively something is sure to stay basically 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.350
 I always like every game for you 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.350
 platform 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.040
 smaller news is also available 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.050
 star wars battlefront so has the 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.880
 Swedish developers from the price of 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.590
 belongs directly to electronic arts and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.020
 there developed the battlelog features 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.240
 quasi announced that they also for 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.280
 star wars battlefront in the future 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.590
 his weblog feature works that way 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.230
 directly similar to battlefield 3 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.389
 4 and battlefield hardliner the 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.000
 battlelog will use the new star 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.580
 it was a game to play with me 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.169
 so on shared opinion my first 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.840
 reaction was there in württemberg but 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.340
 many pc games find that part 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.110
 apparently really good and are with it 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.330
 absolutely satisfied that's kind of like that 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.580
 tool recognizes that probably all with 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.590
 your online around the clock 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.690
 monitor the statistics of your friends 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.370
 but you must also battlelog in 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.330
 Use web browser to play the game 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.710
 to be able to join 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.030
 and I confess that I am now 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.950
 much better again such a 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.330
 would have real ingame lobby 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.820
 I think it is for example 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.860
 Battlefield 3 and 4 and so on 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.650
 I puke that I first into the game 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.050
 I have to go in the multiplayer game 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.490
 press the pause button there and there 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.020
 my settings adjusting for example 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.390
 from the graphics audio quality and such 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.830
 on and on 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.260
 but apparently it is for the ea 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.840
 future star wars battlefront with 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.020
 battlelog please your opinion in the 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.550
 Comments 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.740
 who should have missed yesterday 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.380
 was then the official release of 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.570
 i wolf on all platforms and that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.889
 Ding is currently a bit on the way 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.150
 different opinions if you that 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.580
 should not know this is a pure one 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.520
 multiplayer title where you always have four 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.380
 Hunters compete against a monster completely 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.250
 interesting concept as I think I am 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.660
 Personally, I also have it 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.520
 actually he is so active against it 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.530
 decided to play that because I did 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.780
 Do not think I'm off 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.919
 will tear because I'm missing personally 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.479
 but just a little bit 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.430
 such a singleplayer experience that me 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.410
 from time to time this and sometimes that 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.050
 There can be more excitement 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.729
 because it is almost a mini shop in the 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.340
 play is similar to free to play 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.050
 Play where to buy weapons skins 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.450
 yes my god if you do not like that 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.310
 then they did not buy but there was 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.210
 it's such a small rumor in the net 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.580
 but in the end you have to 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.520
 to form an opinion myself I have 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:52.949
 time the balloon 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:55.379
 and release trailer from left yesterday 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.960
 ubisoft also released today and tomorrow 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:00.330
 new content for far cry 4 is available 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.870
 it's called a new everywhere on dlc like that 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.750
 the whole thing 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.610
 Interestingly, with a pvp mode 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.169
 and four new multiplayer cards and me 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.849
 believe a few new vehicles, yes 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.740
 what a bit split that came 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:14.120
 yesterday for the xbox were today for the 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.080
 playstation 4 and tomorrow for the pc 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.250
 it will be a new game mode 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.680
 probably again a call of duty 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.720
 give and the popular gun game and 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.610
 that's what the studio boss of sledgehammer has 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.880
 myself with the twitter image tweeted 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.639
 where you also see a loading screen 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.710
 could that be worth it in news or 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:36.000
 which is too short i do not quite know game in
