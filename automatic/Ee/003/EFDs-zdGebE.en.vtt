00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
because I'm going to make up another

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370 
because I'm going to make up another
batch<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.699> long<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.210> batches<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
batch of this long two batches I'm just

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
batch of this long two batches I'm just
going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> few<00:00:26.099> slow<00:00:28.939> shumai<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.570> let

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
going to do a few slow shumai just let

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
going to do a few slow shumai just let
you<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> actually<00:00:31.619> goes<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.519> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
you see how it actually goes from a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.950 
you see how it actually goes from a
different<00:00:32.790> angle<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.300> hopefully<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.780> come

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
different angle and hopefully will come

00:00:33.960 --> 00:01:04.720 
different angle and hopefully will come
across<00:00:34.080> later<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.710> way

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.210 

so<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:05.880> same<00:01:06.090> technique<00:01:06.800> will<00:01:07.800> work<00:01:07.830> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so the same technique will work with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
so the same technique will work with
square<00:01:08.490> rappers<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:09.060> around<00:01:09.270> once<00:01:09.590> basically

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
square rappers is around once basically

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.690 
square rappers is around once basically
