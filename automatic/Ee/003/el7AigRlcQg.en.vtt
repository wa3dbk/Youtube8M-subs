00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.050
 and good to all I am was and we are in the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.380
 cave and well let's start now 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.380
 Record 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 but 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.889
 well let's say you can not upload them 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.889
 until 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.330
 in a while since I do not have 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.730
 good 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 scientists 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 If I'm looking at this, it's because 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.500
 recorded a few days ago but as not 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.910
 I have an internet line, what I will do 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.750
 will record a couple of videos and already the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.520
 embedded subjects 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 that I think that 's better 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.870
 since I do not have internet 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.510
 what I will dedicate will be record so finished 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.230
 calling to put me with some control 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.300
 game 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.300
 so good to the middle let's go 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 with this the first thing that this vision of 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.440
 passed a few times I have almost 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.770
 everything that are hosted by the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 path 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.850
 do not 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.320
 It will be a third because I work 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.030
 If you're not worried, do not worry 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 you would be my sister we are the two facts 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.850
 for an occasional flu so do not go 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.390
 to think that he changed the script or something 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.390
 so let's say it 's just something 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 timely 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.539
 this vision is that I have not said 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 against man his side and the next 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.119
 will be the penguin and carbon or the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.280
 kitten that spider because they liked it so much 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.740
 you the name 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 so I'll try to go as fast 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.799
 possible since as I do not like the possible 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.799
 arguments to record 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.440
 I will have some other difficulty 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.520
 and good difficulty to record the most 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.520
 that nothing is 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.049
 what to say 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.180
 we have not had no day friday 10 11 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.150
 from January 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.670
 and when I upload it, I do not know, so 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.980
 do not get scared 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.650
 simply with the objective 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.200
 are not little these things of internet the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.200
 not worth paraphernalia and interested 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.880
 I know a lot of people are liking 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.580
 videos I thank you for the visits and 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.740
 well I have thought to do a direct a 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.040
 so much normal you 're not going to elevate us 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.689
 it's going to be no console game 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.010
 but good is extremely tight in 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.010
 straight forward I hope so 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.770
 they came here 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.770
 here they are very advanced 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.350
 do not tell me it explodes 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.700
 here and here out here not everything is worth 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.010
 tiqui tiqui tiqui tiqui 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.060
 well let's go to the mind but I think it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.060
 hear me 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250
 but good 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.220
 one moment 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.060
 yes yes 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.060
 i 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.010
 let's say you 're sneaking noises 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.010
 they must be counted and they move 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.300
 today is that they are waiting for me direct 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.300
 funny 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 this 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.300
 200 and such but that is not a town that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.020
 it's quiet 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.020
 and good 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.180
 go for it 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.489
 yes the gyrations of the cinemas 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.489
 plague 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.690
 and well this is going to happen 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:46.930
 the m you open the whole I enter I load 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.930
 two fields the hunts k audio 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.689
 the door 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.360
 now this is going to be finding me 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.490
 how many in the tubes 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.500
 out outside out there are not the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.210
 likes to be walking compare me 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.630
 I'm going to explain what I feel 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.050
 if that so that he has the game well and 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.050
 why not 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.410
 of the riva 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.270
 entering directly I happened to fire 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.000
 and so he wants to do what there is then 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.000
 buy the game 1 times more explanatory 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.800
 you should several power you can 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.800
 find 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.579
 why not 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.520
 if you realize with books colima de 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.520
 football and not with yarn 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.960
 about almost then it 's like that look look 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.360
 good plates where all two 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.030
 powers 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.030
 but in the end 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.640
 so well this is based more than anything 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.640
 good I'll see 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.600
 if it is the bat man but a 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.600
 good way 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.229
 for this reason 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.590
 I could be a couple here 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.590
 times 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.200
 OK 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.910
 but then you are already playing 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.460
