didn't even realize that I had fat
underarms<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.500> who<00:00:52.739> knew<00:00:52.949> fattened<00:00:53.460> arms

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
underarms like who knew fattened arms

underarms like who knew fattened arms
was<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.280> deodorant<00:00:57.090> used<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
was and is a thing deodorant used to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
was and is a thing deodorant used to
just<00:00:57.629> glide<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.530> swipe<00:00:58.800> kind<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
just glide on with one swipe kind of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.900 
just glide on with one swipe kind of
like<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.620> one<00:01:01.620> swipe<00:01:01.949> motion<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.609> would<00:01:02.730> go

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
like this one swipe motion it would go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
like this one swipe motion it would go
straight<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> never<00:01:03.930> thought<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> whole<00:01:04.320> lot

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
straight on never thought a whole lot

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560 
straight on never thought a whole lot
about<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.189> could<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.700> any<00:01:05.939> brands<00:01:06.450> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
about that I could use any brands it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
about that I could use any brands it
didn't<00:01:06.810> matter<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.260> were<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.500> cheap

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
didn't matter if they were really cheap

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
didn't matter if they were really cheap
or<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.369> expensive<00:01:08.720> never<00:01:09.720> notice<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
or very expensive never notice the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
or very expensive never notice the
difference<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> didn't<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.460> sweat

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
difference because I didn't really sweat

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
difference because I didn't really sweat
it<00:01:12.570> doesn't<00:01:12.840> make<00:01:12.930> sense<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> large

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it doesn't make sense to be that large

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.789 
it doesn't make sense to be that large
and<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.250> sweat<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.210> maybe<00:01:15.799> it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and to not sweat and I think maybe it's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
and to not sweat and I think maybe it's
because<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.430> having<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> fat<00:01:18.210> arm<00:01:18.600> maybe<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
because of having a fat arm maybe the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.899 
because of having a fat arm maybe the
sweat<00:01:19.860> couldn't<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.369> through<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> fat

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
sweat couldn't get through all the fat

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.840 
sweat couldn't get through all the fat
to<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.770> was<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.890> overly<00:01:23.369> loaded<00:01:23.700> with

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to get out I was like overly loaded with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
to get out I was like overly loaded with
toxins<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:24.570> when<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:24.960> overloaded<00:01:25.380> with

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
toxins which when you're overloaded with

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
toxins which when you're overloaded with
toxins<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> makes<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.490> crave<00:01:26.759> things

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
toxins I think it makes you crave things

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
toxins I think it makes you crave things
like<00:01:28.049> old<00:01:28.259> food<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> still<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.460> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like old food because it's still in your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
like old food because it's still in your
body<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.270> weird<00:01:30.509> way<00:01:30.689> has<00:01:31.530> nothing<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.799> do

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
body in this weird way has nothing to do

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.910 
body in this weird way has nothing to do
with<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.130> video<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.000> been<00:01:33.930> underarms<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.619> had

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
with this video so been underarms I had

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.170 
with this video so been underarms I had
them<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.460> lost<00:01:36.450> 170<00:01:37.439> pounds<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.700> cereal

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
them I lost 170 pounds now I have cereal

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.499 
them I lost 170 pounds now I have cereal
bowls<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> weird<00:01:41.939> thing<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> never

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
bowls and the weird thing that I never

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
bowls and the weird thing that I never
thought<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:42.810> number<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.979> my

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
thought about number one was that my

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
thought about number one was that my
armpits<00:01:44.579> would<00:01:44.729> lose<00:01:44.880> weight<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.890> can't<00:01:47.100> even

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
armpits would lose weight you can't even

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
armpits would lose weight you can't even
measure<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.420> maybe<00:01:49.049> measure

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
measure that you can just maybe measure

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
measure that you can just maybe measure
by<00:01:49.590> fingers<00:01:49.890> how<00:01:50.100> far<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> finger<00:01:50.909> will<00:01:51.060> go

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
by fingers how far and a finger will go

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
by fingers how far and a finger will go
but<00:01:51.750> whenever<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.409> look<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.280> skinny<00:01:53.549> people

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
but whenever you look at skinny people
