we'll<00:00:17.700> be<00:00:17.820> looking<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> hack<00:00:18.509> I'd<00:00:18.720> say<00:00:19.020> quite

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
we'll be looking at a hack I'd say quite

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.440 
we'll be looking at a hack I'd say quite
a<00:00:19.439> few<00:00:19.770> people<00:00:20.099> have<00:00:20.279> their<00:00:20.460> eyes<00:00:20.610> on<00:00:20.640> I'm

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
a few people have their eyes on I'm

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.089 
a few people have their eyes on I'm
definitely<00:00:22.110> looking<00:00:22.290> out<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.770> any<00:00:22.950> new

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
definitely looking out for any new

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.190 
definitely looking out for any new
versions<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.210> look<00:00:24.450> at<00:00:24.630> Sonic<00:00:25.169> the

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
versions as we look at Sonic the

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.609 
versions as we look at Sonic the
Hedgehog<00:00:25.680> tribute<00:00:26.810> now<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.350> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
Hedgehog tribute now this was actually a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
Hedgehog tribute now this was actually a
hack<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.100> found<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.730> long<00:00:30.150> ago<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.810> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
hack I found out about long ago back in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.500 
hack I found out about long ago back in
sage<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.340> course<00:00:32.550> since<00:00:32.879> then<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.330> word

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
sage and of course since then the word

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.850 
sage and of course since then the word
has<00:00:33.690> spread<00:00:34.019> and<00:00:34.199> I've<00:00:34.320> had<00:00:34.500> lots<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
has spread and I've had lots of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
has spread and I've had lots of
recommendations<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.879> show<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.239> off<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.750> well

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
recommendations to show it off and well

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.840 
recommendations to show it off and well
of<00:00:37.290> course<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> good<00:00:37.890> reason<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.370> mean<00:00:38.550> look

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of course for a good reason I mean look

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.290 
of course for a good reason I mean look
at<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:41.550> game<00:00:41.790> pretty<00:00:42.089> as

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
at this look at this this game pretty as

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
at this look at this this game pretty as
 one<00:00:43.350> thing<00:00:43.559> I've<00:00:43.680> always<00:00:43.800> thought<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
 one thing I've always thought is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100 
 one thing I've always thought is
you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.149> hack<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.690> new<00:00:45.870> moves

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you can have a good hack with new moves

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.400 
you can have a good hack with new moves
new<00:00:46.530> layouts<00:00:46.980> new<00:00:47.850> art<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> music<00:00:48.450> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
new layouts new art and music but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
new layouts new art and music but
sometimes<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> lacks<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> polish

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
sometimes it lacks a bit of polish

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
sometimes it lacks a bit of polish
perhaps<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.469> hack<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.980> far<00:00:53.280> though<00:00:53.579> it's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
perhaps this hack so far though it's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.729 
perhaps this hack so far though it's
only<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.390> levels<00:00:54.780> technically<00:00:55.320> you've<00:00:55.530> got

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
only two levels technically you've got

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
only two levels technically you've got
seaside<00:00:56.640> Palace<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> urban<00:00:57.690> rush<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
seaside Palace and urban rush and in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.959 
seaside Palace and urban rush and in
those<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.340> stages

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
those two stages

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
those two stages
it<00:01:00.239> feels<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:00.989> complete<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> stages

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it feels very complete and the stages

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
it feels very complete and the stages
just<00:01:02.699> flow<00:01:03.239> nicely<00:01:03.809> everything<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.830> seems

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
just flow nicely everything just seems

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.240 
just flow nicely everything just seems
to<00:01:05.399> fit<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:06.090> odds<00:01:06.660> in<00:01:06.899> this<00:01:07.050> case<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> pretty

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to fit the odds in this case is pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.300 
to fit the odds in this case is pretty
damn<00:01:08.610> good<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.600> taking<00:01:10.110> various<00:01:10.560> assets<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
damn good it's taking various assets and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
damn good it's taking various assets and
ideas<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.060> stages<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.840> combining

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
ideas from other stages and combining

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.550 
ideas from other stages and combining
them<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.640> detailed<00:01:15.360> level<00:01:15.810> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
them into one very detailed level like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.529 
them into one very detailed level like
the<00:01:16.709> shading<00:01:17.160> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> grass<00:01:17.610> alone<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.270> very

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
the shading on the grass alone is very

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.690 
the shading on the grass alone is very
impressive<00:01:18.959> but<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.860> love<00:01:20.099> the<00:01:20.250> overall

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
impressive but I just love the overall

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.790 
impressive but I just love the overall
feeling<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.450> everything<00:01:21.959> how<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.349> kind<00:01:22.679> of

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
feeling of everything how it all kind of

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.210 
feeling of everything how it all kind of
fits<00:01:23.420> nothing<00:01:24.420> feels<00:01:24.690> too<00:01:25.050> jarring<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.039> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
fits nothing feels too jarring or out of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850 
fits nothing feels too jarring or out of
place<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.940> really<00:01:27.569> like<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.200> background<00:01:28.649> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
place I really like the background with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.070 
place I really like the background with
that<00:01:28.890> whale-like<00:01:29.580> figure<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> ocean<00:01:30.660> it's

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
that whale-like figure in the ocean it's

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.109 
that whale-like figure in the ocean it's
also<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.740> nice<00:01:32.009> subtle<00:01:32.369> parallax

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
also got some nice subtle parallax

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.419 
also got some nice subtle parallax
scrolling<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:34.170> overall<00:01:34.649> makes<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.190> first

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
scrolling it overall makes the first

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.169 
scrolling it overall makes the first
impression<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.270> act<00:01:36.590> ridiculously<00:01:37.590> good

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
impression of this act ridiculously good

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.669 
impression of this act ridiculously good
something<00:01:39.179> else<00:01:39.330> hax<00:01:39.720> sometimes<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.649> I

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
something else hax sometimes do that I

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.740 
something else hax sometimes do that I
really<00:01:41.069> enjoy<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.390> time<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.599> day

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
really enjoy is change the time of day

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
really enjoy is change the time of day
between<00:01:43.080> each<00:01:43.440> level<00:01:43.739> and<00:01:44.069> as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.849> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
between each level and as you can see in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.699 
between each level and as you can see in
this<00:01:45.119> level<00:01:45.300> we<00:01:45.690> have<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> lovely<00:01:46.349> sunset

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
this level we have a lovely sunset

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.889 
this level we have a lovely sunset
feeling<00:01:47.369> even<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:48.239> the<00:01:48.330> point<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> think

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
feeling even to the point where I think

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.370 
feeling even to the point where I think
Sonic<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> slightly<00:01:50.520> tinted<00:01:51.000> orange<00:01:51.569> now<00:01:52.349> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
Sonic is slightly tinted orange now I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.510 
Sonic is slightly tinted orange now I
don't<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.830> that's<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.069> my<00:01:53.369> eyes

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
don't know if that's just my eyes

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.339 
don't know if that's just my eyes
playing<00:01:53.940> tricks<00:01:54.300> on<00:01:54.479> me<00:01:54.539> but<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.989> you<00:01:55.020> play

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
playing tricks on me but if you play

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.440 
playing tricks on me but if you play
this<00:01:55.560> heck<00:01:55.770> yourself<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.789> tell<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.179> if<00:01:57.300> you've

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
this heck yourself you tell me if you've

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.960 
this heck yourself you tell me if you've
noticed<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:59.250> game<00:01:59.489> is<00:01:59.729> really

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
noticed that as well this game is really

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.089 
noticed that as well this game is really
enjoyable<00:02:00.599> even<00:02:00.959> just<00:02:01.440> from<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.679> visual

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
enjoyable even just from a visual

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.339 
enjoyable even just from a visual
standpoint<00:02:02.429> I<00:02:03.000> must<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.630> say<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.229> they've

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
standpoint I must also say that they've

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.410 
standpoint I must also say that they've
picked<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:04.800> really<00:02:05.130> nice<00:02:05.340> music<00:02:05.910> for<00:02:06.179> as

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
for 16-bit I did did some really good

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.320 
for 16-bit I did did some really good
tracks<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.160> one<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.460> heard<00:02:19.640> from<00:02:19.880> Sonic

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
is I seem to remember seeing this level

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720 
is I seem to remember seeing this level
in<00:02:36.080> one<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.530> advanced<00:02:36.890> games<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.490> didn't

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
in one of the advanced games I didn't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.460 
in one of the advanced games I didn't
actually<00:02:37.880> play<00:02:38.390> I've<00:02:38.630> only<00:02:38.780> played<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.260> first

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.220 
actually play I've only played the first
one<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.820> must<00:02:41.060> say<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:41.390> nicely<00:02:41.630> ported

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
one but I must say it's nicely ported

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.770 
one but I must say it's nicely ported
into<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.620> version<00:02:43.100> anyway<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.600> can

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
into this version anyway and if you can

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.170 
into this version anyway and if you can
tell<00:02:45.020> from<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.290> background<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:46.180> day/night

we're<00:02:49.370> both<00:02:49.790> doing<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.420> at<00:02:50.600> night<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:51.230> course

we're both doing this at night of course

we're both doing this at night of course
if<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.400> isn't<00:02:52.730> hax<00:02:52.970> using<00:02:53.480> Kirby<00:02:53.959> music<00:02:54.410> it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
if it isn't hax using Kirby music it's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
if it isn't hax using Kirby music it's
hack<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.100> using<00:02:55.370> Mike<00:02:55.550> Jackson<00:02:56.180> music<00:02:56.360> not<00:02:57.200> to

hack to using Mike Jackson music not to
say<00:02:57.440> there's<00:02:57.650> anything<00:02:57.860> wrong<00:02:58.250> with<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
say there's anything wrong with that I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.190 
say there's anything wrong with that I
just<00:02:59.030> wonder<00:02:59.420> why<00:02:59.630> there's<00:02:59.870> always<00:03:00.050> a

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
just wonder why there's always a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.290 
just wonder why there's always a
connection<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:01.040> understand<00:03:01.790> about<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.120> whole

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
connection I understand about the whole

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.570 
connection I understand about the whole
soundtrack<00:03:03.020> thing<00:03:03.500> with<00:03:03.680> Michael<00:03:04.040> Jackson

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
soundtrack thing with Michael Jackson

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.210 
soundtrack thing with Michael Jackson
but<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.630> don't<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.560> if<00:03:06.680> some<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> them<00:03:07.100> always

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
but I don't know if some of them always

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.760 
but I don't know if some of them always
fit<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.880> sonic<00:03:08.239> scene<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:09.350> might<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.739> be

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
fit the sonic scene that might just be

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.830 
fit the sonic scene that might just be
personal<00:03:10.250> preference<00:03:10.640> though<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.420> overall

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
personal preference though so overall

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.199 
personal preference though so overall
sonic<00:03:12.380> hasn't<00:03:12.680> really<00:03:12.890> changed<00:03:12.920> much<00:03:13.370> he<00:03:14.060> has

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
sonic hasn't really changed much he has

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.780 
sonic hasn't really changed much he has
a<00:03:14.239> spin<00:03:15.170> -<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.650> mean<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.430> hack<00:03:16.610> of

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
a spin - I mean but this is a hack of

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.030 
a spin - I mean but this is a hack of
Sonic<00:03:17.090> 2<00:03:17.270> so<00:03:17.510> would<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.750> expect<00:03:18.080> but<00:03:18.769> apart

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
Sonic 2 so would you expect but apart

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.610 
Sonic 2 so would you expect but apart
from<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.250> it's<00:03:19.549> fairly<00:03:19.850> unchanged<00:03:20.690> as<00:03:21.170> for

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
from that it's fairly unchanged as for

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.830 
from that it's fairly unchanged as for
the<00:03:21.680> levels<00:03:22.010> themselves<00:03:22.660> obviously<00:03:23.660> these

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the levels themselves obviously these

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.870 
the levels themselves obviously these
are<00:03:24.049> completely<00:03:24.530> custom<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.220> accommodate<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
new style of art but keeping the various

new style of art but keeping the various

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.860

as<00:03:31.160> well<00:03:31.430> although<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.209> lot<00:03:32.420> of<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.720> would

as well although a lot of that would

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.180 
as well although a lot of that would
probably<00:03:33.080> make<00:03:33.380> more<00:03:33.530> sense<00:03:33.799> if<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.040> actually

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
probably make more sense if you actually

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.720 
probably make more sense if you actually
knew<00:03:34.640> how<00:03:34.880> most<00:03:35.330> of<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.600> sonic<00:03:35.870> editors<00:03:36.230> work

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
knew how most of the sonic editors work

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.570 
knew how most of the sonic editors work

a few dick moments I can kind of forgive
them<00:03:47.090> as<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.950> don't<00:03:49.070> always<00:03:49.280> have<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.670> go<00:03:49.850> down

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
those paths I actually only found out

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.910 
those paths I actually only found out
about<00:03:53.030> these<00:03:53.330> really<00:03:53.660> annoying<00:03:53.959> placements

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
about these really annoying placements

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.460 
about these really annoying placements
of<00:03:55.040> spikes<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.120> run<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.570> particular<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
of spikes on this run in particular the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.259 
of spikes on this run in particular the
first<00:03:57.709> time<00:03:57.920> I've<00:03:58.070> played<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.430> hack<00:03:58.670> ever<00:03:58.970> I

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
first time I've played this hack ever I

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.030 
first time I've played this hack ever I
pretty<00:03:59.780> much<00:03:59.870> didn't<00:04:00.230> ever<00:04:00.380> run<00:04:00.590> into<00:04:00.890> them

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
pretty much didn't ever run into them

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.370 
pretty much didn't ever run into them
there<00:04:01.640> are<00:04:01.730> different<00:04:02.090> branching<00:04:02.660> paths<00:04:02.989> a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
there are different branching paths a

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.920 
there are different branching paths a
lot<00:04:03.560> like<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.950> originals<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:05.390> pays<00:04:05.660> off

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
lot like the originals and it pays off

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.289 
lot like the originals and it pays off
to<00:04:05.959> try<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.500> explore<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> bit<00:04:07.250> overall<00:04:08.060> very

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
to try and explore a bit overall very

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.680 
to try and explore a bit overall very
solid<00:04:09.080> level<00:04:09.290> design<00:04:09.790> so<00:04:10.790> how<00:04:10.940> many<00:04:11.000> GTA

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
solid level design so how many GTA

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.650 
solid level design so how many GTA
references<00:04:12.019> can<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.739> see<00:04:13.010> in<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.250> back

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
references can you see in the back

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.199 
references can you see in the back
and<00:04:13.810> it's<00:04:14.590> looking<00:04:14.980> like<00:04:15.040> Sonic<00:04:15.640> tribute<00:04:16.060> is

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
and it's looking like Sonic tribute is

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.090 
and it's looking like Sonic tribute is
shaping<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:16.989> be<00:04:17.110> something<00:04:17.500> really

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
shaping up to be something really

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.949 
shaping up to be something really
interesting<00:04:18.430> but<00:04:18.910> I'm<00:04:19.030> definitely<00:04:19.269> keeping

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
interesting but I'm definitely keeping

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.560 
interesting but I'm definitely keeping
my<00:04:20.140> eyes<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.320> not<00:04:21.220> too<00:04:21.489> often<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> find<00:04:22.450> a

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
my eyes on not too often do I find a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.300 
my eyes on not too often do I find a
hack<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.780> I'm<00:04:23.110> really<00:04:23.410> looking<00:04:23.680> forward<00:04:24.130> to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
hack that I'm really looking forward to

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.740 
hack that I'm really looking forward to
seeing<00:04:24.490> what<00:04:24.640> other<00:04:24.790> levels<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.330> play<00:04:25.570> in

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
seeing what other levels they play in

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.050 
seeing what other levels they play in
because<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.890> one<00:04:27.040> feels<00:04:27.310> really<00:04:27.400> different

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
because this one feels really different

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.240 
because this one feels really different
and<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:28.960> can't<00:04:29.200> wait<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.410> see<00:04:29.710> what<00:04:29.890> kind<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
and I can't wait to see what kind of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.980 
and I can't wait to see what kind of
things<00:04:30.550> they<00:04:30.700> try<00:04:31.090> out<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.420> different<00:04:31.780> art

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
things they try out with different art

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.840 
things they try out with different art
styles<00:04:32.110> with<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.860> levels<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.550> different

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
styles with the levels and different

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.240 
styles with the levels and different
music<00:04:34.030> try<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:34.870> with<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.140> levels<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.650> well

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
music try and go with the levels as well

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.910 
music try and go with the levels as well
what<00:04:36.580> other<00:04:36.700> enemies<00:04:37.150> you'll<00:04:37.480> see<00:04:37.770> even<00:04:38.770> with

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
what other enemies you'll see even with

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.650 
what other enemies you'll see even with
this<00:04:39.040> short<00:04:39.310> demo<00:04:39.670> it's<00:04:39.820> provided<00:04:40.330> me<00:04:40.360> with<00:04:40.480> a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
this short demo it's provided me with a

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.510 
this short demo it's provided me with a
much<00:04:41.020> different<00:04:41.620> experience<00:04:41.860> now<00:04:42.400> as

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
much different experience now as

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.820 
much different experience now as
expecting<00:04:43.180> within<00:04:43.810> these<00:04:43.990> some<00:04:44.260> attacks<00:04:44.560> and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
expecting within these some attacks and

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.400 
expecting within these some attacks and
I<00:04:45.130> applaud<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.610> for<00:04:45.760> that<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.060> should<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:47.020> go

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
I applaud it for that you should all go

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.880 
I applaud it for that you should all go
and<00:04:47.440> play<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.100> say<00:04:48.790> how<00:04:48.970> awesome<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.740> can

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
and play and say how awesome is you can

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.650 
and play and say how awesome is you can
actually<00:04:51.070> get<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.580> sneak<00:04:51.850> peek<00:04:52.150> at<00:04:52.330> another

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
actually get a sneak peek at another

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.570 
actually get a sneak peek at another
level<00:04:52.840> by<00:04:53.440> going<00:04:53.830> into<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.160> versus<00:04:54.550> mode

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
level by going into the versus mode

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.970 
level by going into the versus mode
which<00:04:55.390> randomly<00:04:56.230> took<00:04:56.470> me<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> level

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
which randomly took me to the level

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.880 
which randomly took me to the level
select<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:58.090> all<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.480> sudden<00:04:58.510> I'm<00:04:58.870> tails<00:04:59.110> but

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
select and all of a sudden I'm tails but

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.140 
select and all of a sudden I'm tails but
I<00:04:59.950> don't<00:05:00.280> know<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.610> is<00:05:00.760> going<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.970> be

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
I don't know if this is going to be

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.910 
I don't know if this is going to be
actually<00:05:01.420> in<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.020> game<00:05:02.170> or<00:05:02.560> if<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.770> was<00:05:02.860> a

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
actually in the game or if it was a

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.250 
actually in the game or if it was a
scrap<00:05:03.250> level<00:05:03.610> or<00:05:03.910> something<00:05:04.360> I'm<00:05:04.900> not<00:05:04.960> sure

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
scrap level or something I'm not sure

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.650 
scrap level or something I'm not sure
I'd<00:05:05.980> also<00:05:06.190> suggest<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.880> if<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.150> do<00:05:07.300> try<00:05:07.540> out

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
I'd also suggest that if you do try out

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.690 
I'd also suggest that if you do try out
this<00:05:07.810> hack<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.470> go<00:05:08.590> into<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.890> sound<00:05:09.100> test<00:05:09.400> and

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
this hack to go into the sound test and

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.310 
this hack to go into the sound test and
have<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.820> little<00:05:10.000> poke<00:05:10.270> around<00:05:10.420> see<00:05:10.720> what<00:05:10.990> music

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
have a little poke around see what music

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.440 
have a little poke around see what music
they're<00:05:11.470> using<00:05:11.830> as<00:05:11.980> most<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.520> them<00:05:12.640> seem<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.330> be

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
they're using as most of them seem to be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.200 
they're using as most of them seem to be
in<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.930> but<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:14.830> has<00:05:15.100> been<00:05:15.430> Sonic<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
in there but this has been Sonic the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.050 
in there but this has been Sonic the
Hedgehog<00:05:16.690> tribute<00:05:17.440> I'll<00:05:17.980> see<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.550> next<00:05:18.580> time
