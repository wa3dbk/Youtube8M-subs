no this is going to happen we already
knew<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.100> once<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:57.000> happened<00:02:57.600> it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
knew this so once this happened it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.960 
knew this so once this happened it
seemed<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.740> story<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> progressing

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
seemed like the story is progressing

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.240 
seemed like the story is progressing
even<00:03:00.480> though<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.050> progressing<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.100> little

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
even though it's progressing a little

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.230 
even though it's progressing a little
bit<00:03:02.460> too<00:03:02.670> fast

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
bit too fast

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.060 
bit too fast
I<00:03:03.270> don't<00:03:03.630> think<00:03:03.660> north<00:03:03.990> ocean<00:03:04.410> Altos<00:03:04.920> should

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
I don't think north ocean Altos should

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.010 
I don't think north ocean Altos should
be<00:03:05.160> able<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.550> use<00:03:05.820> these<00:03:06.060> beasts<00:03:06.390> like<00:03:06.690> you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
be able to use these beasts like you

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.160 
be able to use these beasts like you
know<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:07.380> he<00:03:07.530> should<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.370> way<00:03:08.490> he<00:03:08.670> is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
know the way he should the way he is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.050 
know the way he should the way he is
just<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.380> fast<00:03:10.710> it<00:03:11.040> doesn't<00:03:11.280> make<00:03:11.610> any<00:03:11.880> sense

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
just so fast it doesn't make any sense

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.000 
just so fast it doesn't make any sense
to<00:03:12.270> me<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.630> being<00:03:13.170> able<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> pull<00:03:13.650> off<00:03:13.800> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
to me and being able to pull off that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.350 
to me and being able to pull off that
beast<00:03:14.250> bomb<00:03:14.460> at<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.940> level

beast bomb at that level
no<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.070> he<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.640> now<00:03:17.790> being<00:03:18.120> able<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
no just and he just now being able to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.150 
no just and he just now being able to
you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:18.750> fight<00:03:19.260> with<00:03:19.530> Karami

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
you know fight with Karami

you know fight with Karami
it<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.970> doesn't<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:22.730> one<00:03:23.730> more<00:03:23.970> thing

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
it just doesn't and one more thing

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
it just doesn't and one more thing
somebody<00:03:25.350> told<00:03:25.650> me<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.340> comment<00:03:26.730> section

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
somebody told me in the comment section

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
somebody told me in the comment section
and<00:03:27.300> I'm<00:03:27.510> pretty<00:03:27.690> much<00:03:27.780> going<00:03:28.230> with<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.590> that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
and I'm pretty much going with it that

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.060 
and I'm pretty much going with it that
Kurama<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> strongest<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
Kurama is the strongest out of the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.160 
Kurama is the strongest out of the
beaches<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.360> but<00:03:33.870> he<00:03:33.960> says

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
beaches that we know that but he says

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.460 
beaches that we know that but he says
he's<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.410> strongest<00:03:34.650> by<00:03:35.010> far<00:03:35.750> okay<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.990> cannot

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
he's the strongest by far okay I cannot

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.980 
he's the strongest by far okay I cannot
agree<00:03:37.770> with<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.420> reason<00:03:39.840> why<00:03:39.960> I

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
agree with that but the reason why I

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.480 
agree with that but the reason why I
said<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> power<00:03:40.530> levels<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.100> messed<00:03:41.340> up

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
said the power levels is messed up

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.510 
said the power levels is messed up
because<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:42.410> Kurama<00:03:43.410> might<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
because this Kurama might be the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.290

Naruto<00:04:03.270> his<00:04:04.020> cowl<00:04:04.350> was<00:04:04.710> not<00:04:04.980> at<00:04:05.700> is<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.450> know

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
Naruto his cowl was not at is you know

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.800 
Naruto his cowl was not at is you know
at<00:04:07.080> his<00:04:07.290> max<00:04:07.620> at<00:04:07.860> even<00:04:08.220> half<00:04:08.490> of<00:04:08.700> his<00:04:08.880> power<00:04:09.120> so

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
at his max at even half of his power so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.540 
at his max at even half of his power so
it's<00:04:10.020> probably<00:04:10.350> divided<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:10.980> divided<00:04:11.280> and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
it's probably divided and divided and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.020 
it's probably divided and divided and

dealing<00:04:15.270> with<00:04:15.480> BG<00:04:15.840> mode<00:04:16.170> so<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.799> should

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
dealing with BG mode so that should

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.770 
dealing with BG mode so that should
divide<00:04:17.340> his<00:04:17.520> power<00:04:17.730> up<00:04:17.940> even<00:04:18.239> more<00:04:18.450> but<00:04:18.630> they

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
divide his power up even more but they

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.870 
divide his power up even more but they
still<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.590> able<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:20.400> defeat<00:04:20.700> these

three or four something like that

-<00:05:32.790> it's<00:05:33.240> actually<00:05:33.600> starting<00:05:33.720> to<00:05:33.900> look<00:05:34.050> like

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
- it's actually starting to look like

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.380 
- it's actually starting to look like
the<00:05:34.470> sage<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.130> they<00:05:35.460> gave<00:05:35.700> a<00:05:35.730> good<00:05:36.060> for<00:05:36.300> the

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
the sage and they gave a good for the

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.840 
the sage and they gave a good for the
shade<00:05:36.660> sage<00:05:37.140> he<00:05:37.830> probably<00:05:38.100> looks<00:05:38.370> like<00:05:38.550> Minato

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
shade sage he probably looks like Minato

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.810 
shade sage he probably looks like Minato
and<00:05:39.180> all<00:05:39.390> intercept<00:05:39.870> olden<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.560> noorthoek<00:05:41.550> he

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
and all intercept olden and noorthoek he

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.310 
and all intercept olden and noorthoek he
had<00:05:41.970> got<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.240> little<00:05:42.510> horn<00:05:42.810> things<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.200> the

had got the little horn things at the
sage<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:44.070> guess<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.820> think<00:05:45.000> it's<00:05:45.090> his

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
sage and I guess it I think it's his

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.480 
sage and I guess it I think it's his
hair<00:05:45.390> sticking<00:05:45.720> up<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.140> also<00:05:46.590> got<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.310> on
