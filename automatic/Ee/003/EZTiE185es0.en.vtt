00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello youtube friends today I'm here 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.220
 to show you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 internal tank that I just pulled out 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 retire after 22 years of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.230
 uninterrupted service intimately not 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.870
 I was walking well I could not reach 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.020
 heat the stopped water well 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.970
 after bathing two or three injured people 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.900
 I decided to change it but before I want 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.940
 show them how is a thermos such that by 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.870
 inside I'll make a ruse to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.580
 know why he said to heat water and not 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 I had a feeling I had when 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.320
 it was new now let's see it while 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.320
 I do the autopsy, I will not go anymore 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.980
 as you can see here the burner and its 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.760
 thermo cupla are in perfect condition already 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 that worked 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.159
 is not eating or anything, so the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.060
 part of the flame went perfectly 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.980
 and we are going to take out 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.400
 water inlet and outlet 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.870
 well here we find the exit 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 of water 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.530
 the relief valve is in good condition 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 but here we are 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.510
 that we are with cabbage 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.880
 a lot of cholesterol 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.370
 what we would be cholesterol that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.530
 they were clogging the pipes what 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.540
 same is happening with the other is not 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.230
 this is the main problem but it is one 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.230
 of the problems 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.549
 the fireplace is in perfect 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.549
 state 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.100
 we proceed to remove the glass wool 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.100
 from Alicante 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.649
 as you can see the pipes 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.349
 also already inside him 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.349
 inside the thermos tank are clogged 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.220
 the fund itself is in good 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.730
 been in spite of being exposed for 22 years 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.810
 the flame 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.420
 It is in very good condition 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.290
 there are no obvious signs of sting 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.290
 nothing like that 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.780
 This is my pet, he reads it 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 It was jeff hermitage 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.950
 and now it's fine 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.519
 she is the one who had the attack of 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.519
 epilepsy 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.550
 he films in a previous video 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.550
 now it's fine 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.650
 good enough is enough 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.850
 good 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.189
 to 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.950
 now we are going to proceed to open a 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.950
 window to impress your interior 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.610
 the sheet inside was in 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.840
 perfect radioactive state of corrosion 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.890
 the kataforesis worked perfectly 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.500
 after 22 years 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.740
 and with that we are here inside 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.730
 that the background 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.160
 I was with a lot of tartar 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.489
 product of the calcification of 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.079
 minerals in the water 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.079
 by the temperature change 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 and that meant there was not good 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.710
 heat exchange and that's why I did not have 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.710
 performance 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.700
 all this development is what to cover 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.470
 the central chimney that also contributes 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.360
 heat to water 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:58.090
 the central tube that you see there 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:01.180
 It was covered with the whole car 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.080
 what got him out of service is this 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.009
 mountain of tartar 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.760
 that he had inside and isolated the 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.100
 background flame 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.830
 of the tacho and therefore did not deliver the 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.129
 heat to water simply the heat is 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.969
 I would go by the fireplace 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.610
 In short, what got him out of 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.759
 functioning after 22 years has not 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.929
 been its quality but the lack of 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.929
 Preventive Maintenance 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.430
 once a month that's why I advise you 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:41.280
 let them see that they do so many years 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:44.070
 another mistake is not to have changed 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.680
 to the magnesium node that is the one that prevents 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.580
 that tartar is formed that change it 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.430
 once a year 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.810
 I changed it only after two years 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.810
 change once and never again 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.699
 anyway 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.699
 It was an unjust death 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.459
 If I had taken care I would have lasted ten 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.009
 fifteen more years for the state that is 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:10.509
 find is perfect inside there is no 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.840
 the forensic letter worked out of 10 it's not 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.880
 corroÃ­do is not punctured 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.340
 the sheet is in perfect 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.400
 state 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.470
 So, as a council, I have a 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.330
 hot water tank if you have the luck that has 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.639
 come out like this if you take care of him 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.979
 last for many more years of course 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.320
 all this is going to be recycled this has 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.919
 taken to iron scrap yards 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:39.800
 the burner we will make a heater for 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:42.319
 make the gas disk to make food 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.620
 large kitchen here in Argentina is used 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:48.229
 it's called the disc is a big pot in 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.840
 which is made fire down with firewood 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.060
 or with whatever it is and it cooks there 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.250
 we will also recycle it 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.530
 grant the sheet will go to the unarm 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.069
 that they melt and do others 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.069
 home appliances 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.500
 the tripod on which the 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.070
 camera to be able to do this shot is 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.440
 made with this multi fixing bracket 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:17.660
 that is published in the link that gives them 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:20.750
 I just gave friends, I hope you have them 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.020
 liked this video remember that here in 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.270
 angelito channel to see more videos 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.600
 of this type and many others of 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:32.770
 inventions home also friends will be 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.770
 Until we meet again
