00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.640 

we're<00:00:03.179> gonna<00:00:03.300> try<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.720> do<00:00:03.840> an<00:00:03.929> example<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
we're gonna try and do an example to

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.230 
we're gonna try and do an example to
find<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.220> specific<00:00:05.490> heat<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:07.910> so<00:00:08.910> here's<00:00:09.090> my

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
find the specific heat of so here's my

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.870 
find the specific heat of so here's my
problem<00:00:09.780> I've<00:00:09.960> got<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:11.780> medal<00:00:13.400> that<00:00:14.400> probably

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
problem I've got a medal that probably

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
problem I've got a medal that probably
is<00:00:15.059> put<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.570> beaker<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> boiling<00:00:16.590> water<00:00:16.800> so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is put in a beaker of boiling water so

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.900 
is put in a beaker of boiling water so
it's<00:00:17.190> currently<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> hundred<00:00:17.850> degrees<00:00:19.910> my

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's currently at a hundred degrees my

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.320 
it's currently at a hundred degrees my
calorimeter<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.660> full<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:23.119> looks<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
calorimeter is full of looks like a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
calorimeter is full of looks like a
hundred<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.869> twenty<00:00:25.230> five<00:00:25.500> grams<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:26.369> water

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
hundred and twenty five grams of water

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.479 
hundred and twenty five grams of water
and<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.750> currently<00:00:28.609> 25<00:00:29.609> degrees<00:00:30.119> Celsius

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
and it's currently 25 degrees Celsius

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
and it's currently 25 degrees Celsius
when<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> add<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.210> hot<00:00:33.480> metal<00:00:33.989> which<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
when I add this hot metal which was a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.250 
when I add this hot metal which was a
hundred<00:00:35.190> degrees<00:00:38.510> it's<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> lose<00:00:39.960> its

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
hundred degrees it's going to lose its

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.020 
hundred degrees it's going to lose its
heat<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> water<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> metal<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.760> cool

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
heat to the water so the metal will cool

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.510 
heat to the water so the metal will cool
the<00:00:45.870> water<00:00:46.079> temperature<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:46.829> arrive<00:00:47.100> until

the water temperature will arrive until

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.990 
the water temperature will arrive until
eventually<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.539> both<00:00:48.870> reach<00:00:49.850> twenty<00:00:50.850> eight

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
eventually they both reach twenty eight

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
where did it end well it's going to end

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
where did it end well it's going to end
at<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.320> temperature<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.310> water

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
at the same temperature that the water

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
at the same temperature that the water
did<00:01:39.060> heat<00:01:39.960> keeps<00:01:40.259> flowing<00:01:40.740> until<00:01:40.829> they're<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
did heat keeps flowing until they're the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 
did heat keeps flowing until they're the
same<00:01:41.460> temperature<00:01:41.850> till<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> metal<00:01:43.110> ended<00:01:43.590> at

same temperature till the metal ended at
twenty<00:01:44.070> eight<00:01:44.250> point<00:01:44.610> three<00:01:45.000> degrees<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
twenty eight point three degrees just

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.270 
twenty eight point three degrees just
like<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> water<00:01:48.240> did<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> my<00:01:49.799> change<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
like the water did so my change in

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
like the water did so my change in
temperature<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> metal<00:01:51.390> looks<00:01:51.990> like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
temperature for the metal looks like

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
temperature for the metal looks like
it's<00:01:52.409> negative<00:01:52.979> seventy<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.880> point<00:01:54.299> seven

it's negative seventy one point seven
degrees<00:01:55.079> Celsius<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> goes<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.740> here

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
degrees Celsius so that goes over here

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.200 
degrees Celsius so that goes over here
change<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> temperature<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> negative

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
change in temperature is negative

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.960 
change in temperature is negative

seventy one point seven Celsius degrees
all<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.030> need<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.050> find<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.379> heat<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
all I need now is to find the heat that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.059 
all I need now is to find the heat that
the<00:02:11.340> metal<00:02:11.670> lost

the metal lost

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.320 
the metal lost
unfortunately<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.099> can't<00:02:14.459> find<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.970> heat<00:02:15.209> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the metal loss or they didn't give it to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.300 
the metal loss or they didn't give it to
me

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
me

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.059 
me
but<00:02:18.150> where<00:02:18.569> did<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.840> heat<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> metal

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
but where did the heat that the metal

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.690 
but where did the heat that the metal
lost<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.660> went<00:02:22.470> into<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.800> water<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.520> can

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
lost go it went into the water so I can

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.540 
lost go it went into the water so I can
find<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.599> cue<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.080> water<00:02:27.020> very<00:02:28.020> simply<00:02:28.680> by

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
this case the reaction is simply the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.449 
this case the reaction is simply the
metal<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.900> surroundings<00:03:52.709> are<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.489> water

metal and the surroundings are the water

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.819 
metal and the surroundings are the water
so<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.730> metal<00:03:57.120> is<00:03:57.299> losing<00:03:57.630> heat<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.319> water<00:03:58.560> is

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
so the metal is losing heat the water is

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.300 
so the metal is losing heat the water is
gaining<00:03:59.190> heat<00:03:59.989> so<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.139> values<00:04:01.470> are<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.680> same

if the water loss 17:25 are gained 1725
that<00:04:07.799> means<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.250> metal<00:04:08.549> lost<00:04:10.160> 1725<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.750> that

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
that means the metal lost 1725 so that

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.460 
that means the metal lost 1725 so that
