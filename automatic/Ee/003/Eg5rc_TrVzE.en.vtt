00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.889
 Hi everyone, today we are here with this 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.060
 notebook that is the transformer book flip 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.860
 tp 500 l ha is a convertible that has the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.140
 particularity of being enough 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.130
 as big as you can see on a screen 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.560
 from 15.6 inches the rotation method is 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.489
 the same as yoga 3 pros and many 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.770
 other models 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.489
 the difference compared to the others and that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.399
 this product 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.880
 being a 15 and 6 and not a 13 is a bit 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.929
 less manageable as you can see yes 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.530
 wheel can be put into what one does 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:53.329
 call stand position in what you do 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:59.170
 call tent position or be 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.170
 used as a tablet as a notebook 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 being a 15.6 inch product 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.010
 offers the advantage of having a base 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 wide in which the producer could 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.000
 insert a size keyboard 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 standard with numeric keypad a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 part is a touch spends very large not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.210
 the connectivity on the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 first side we find the windows button 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.900
 than what it takes to return 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.060
 always at home when using the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.729
 produced in tablet mode two 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.880
 usb connectors the volume rocker 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 and the power button also this in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.410
 this position to be accessible 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 when using the product in mode 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.729
 Tablet 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.250
 on the other side there are the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.979
 power connector in a socket 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.539
 standard for ethernet connection a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.690
 sd card reader 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.960
 hd video output and never another 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.509
 USB connector and the combined jack 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 for headphones and microphone 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.520
 the configuration we received 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.390
 in test it foresees an i7 core processor 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.450
 8GB of memory and a hard drive 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 one terabyte mechanic precisely the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.290
 mechanical hard disk in the tests that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.720
 we are playing is proving one 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.400
 of slower components than 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 all other hybrid solutions by 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.080
 this type make use of the ssd 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.150
 the other problem we are noticing on 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.810
 this product and that you can see you 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.489
 themselves 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.129
 right now we're running a 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.470
 autonomy text is that brightness 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.750
 of the display is lower than the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.920
 average we are around 150 candles per 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.050
 square meter 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.569
 this means that in conditions of 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.580
 intense ambient light as in this one 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.640
 case with the lights pointing towards the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.860
 display readability and very low 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.319
 be aware however that in circulation 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.629
 there is not only this version that we 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.290
 we are trying there is also a top of 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.880
 range with the 1900 20 x 1080 display 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.130
 pixel in v 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.910
 of this low resolution that is alone 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.890
 hd and with more powerful configurations 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.480
 the strong point of this version of the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.580
 product is that it costs 529 euros 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.270
 the top of the range with the full hd display 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.160
 instead it costs 1,066 euros 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.230
 has all the technical characteristics 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.860
 and the link to learn more about this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.560
