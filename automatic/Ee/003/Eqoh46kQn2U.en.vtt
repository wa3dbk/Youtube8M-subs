that and you know kind of Express the
different<00:00:48.360> little<00:00:48.510> tie-ins<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.710> people

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
different little tie-ins that people

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.240 
different little tie-ins that people
have<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.879> venable<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> all<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
have with venable and all this so and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.369 
have with venable and all this so and
this<00:00:53.370> might<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.850> offensive<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.780> if

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this might be a little offensive so if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.310 
this might be a little offensive so if
you<00:00:55.500> guys<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:56.340> care<00:00:56.940> keep<00:00:57.570> watching<00:00:57.750> can't

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you guys don't care keep watching can't

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.360 
you guys don't care keep watching can't
say<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> didn't<00:00:58.770> warn<00:00:58.800> you

say I didn't warn you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.240 
say I didn't warn you
so<00:00:59.820> basically<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.960> conspiracy<00:01:01.289> theory<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so basically this conspiracy theory is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.840 
so basically this conspiracy theory is
that<00:01:02.280> Dragon<00:01:03.149> Ball<00:01:03.329> has<00:01:04.140> some<00:01:04.680> heavy<00:01:05.010> Nazi
