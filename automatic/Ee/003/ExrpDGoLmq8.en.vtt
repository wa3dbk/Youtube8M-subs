00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.429
 a field of photography appeals to me 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.269
 especially in low light too 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.820
 taking photos 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 together with my assistant 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.240
 I like a few techniques for you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 after sunset photos creative 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.980
 can shape design possible 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 is a great option the camera 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.340
 to use creatively 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.500
 this is all about shooting 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 long exposure times at long 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 exposure, the shutter stays longer 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.070
 opened so become moving 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.020
 elements out of focus we use here 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.899
 an ios 6d but this technique 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 works well with others 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 is important 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.200
 keep the camera steady 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.780
 You need a sturdy tripod 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 and maybe a remote trigger 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.129
 if you have tv and a long exposure 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 adjust ten to 15 seconds regulates 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.010
 your camera automatically and the blender 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 very aim pictures like this one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 Dramatic here is something with the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.000
 Car headlights happened as they did 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 move through the picture 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.260
 Now let's try it like we do 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 It is easy to use light creatively 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 so photographed loses this scene 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 its drama but not when we light 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.340
 bring into play 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 one focuses during the shots bright 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.090
 You can shed light on a motive 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 control and receive light 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.260
 a great plastic effect 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.810
 for a nice depth of field I have 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.090
 in manual mode aperture 8 selected iso 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.660
 100 and a closing time of 30 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.490
 seconds 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.380
 what makes the thing so exciting 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.330
 dramatic effects on the statue 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.479
 can be with almost any one 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.700
 light source generate experiment 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.930
 with light sources of light intensity and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 also with color 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.390
 you have to try something around though 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 that's what makes it so exciting 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 cities are particularly receptive 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.810
 interesting because there are so many motives 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 but especially in very dark places without 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.590
 artificial light can last longer 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.430
 Closing times for even more dramatic 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.430
 use effects 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.880
 this lonely bridge is the perfect one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 Place for light experiments you need 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.390
 longer closing times so that you can 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 Illuminate the motif from multiple angles 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.290
 can take about 30 seconds 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.510
 or you choose the long-time exposure b 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 and determine the closing time manually 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.560
 by remote trigger then the right one 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.239
 Set the aperture for the depth of field 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 In this case 56 ends 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.540
 then choose the iso sensitivity 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.140
 for the appropriate exposure of the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.090
 background for this the sky 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.099
 I put two LED lights to a 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.939
 My forehead light my phone and two 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.129
 flashlights 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.659
 you do not need so much equipment 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.790
 to have an effect like this here too 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.680
 achieve with some experience and feeling 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.329
 for the creative design with light 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.810
 Can you give impressive results 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.810
 achieve
