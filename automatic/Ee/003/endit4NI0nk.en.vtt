00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.290
 in my garage 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 you already see that the color is 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.760
 really beautiful it gives a blue 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 green with a little yellow pearly effect this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.400
 who is really beautiful 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.960
 so here it goes I'll go quickly 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the painting is actually to have 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 this end result which is really I 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 find beautiful 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 you just have to go in colors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 main color there you go in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 metallic 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 gold will select green so this is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.950
 the oil glass that's right here at 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.250
 full green oil so twelve thousand 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.229
 dollars 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.280
 there you buy it you see that already I 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.650
 find that this color is really 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 beautiful all alone I find 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 acres and so the oil glass life of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.950

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 small yellow pearlescent effect racing and you 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.690

 blue green yellow who I will not I 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.430
 find that this color is really 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.870
 magnificent 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.690
 comments what do you have 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.560
 thought of that little color in everything 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.430
 case I think she is really 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 very nice was a nice reflection here there 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
 then in secondary colors 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.260
 I invite you to put the same 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.759
 oil air color if you want that 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.530
 it's really nice then you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
 can have fun m towards another 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.280
 other color of the white of the blue of the black 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.690
 we are really only with the glass 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.930
 oil it's really beautiful so 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.219
 I'm going to leave the oil it's a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.930
 kind of cocks united I think it 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.620
 it's pretty cool here I go quickly 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.120
 leave the garage 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.439
 to show you what is it 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.799
 this color gives with the reflections of the 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.030
 Sun 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:36.439
 you will see that she is really 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:38.510
 beautiful now we'll go with 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.739
 second color of this episode so there 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.939
 as you can see it's a rape 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.379
 and who is still pretty enough 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.000
 I think it's really beautiful 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.230
 so it's a rape and that's pretty 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.359
 dark but still effects 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.230
 despite the worst light effects at these 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.819
 flash 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.810
 except it's really not bad not going 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.430
 immediately returned to alice 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.230
 not custom that I can tell you the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.150
 mix of colors to do to arrive 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.590
 to make that color so it's gone 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.269
 I'll go into the custom ls 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.620
 so if you ever have colors 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.629
 what the fuck to offer us 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.219
 not to put them in comment to 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.930
 send me messages also private about 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.980
 facebook I will not hesitate to put them 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.719
 in the rankings if I find that they 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 are really beautiful so that's 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.500
 parsian adam painting main color 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.060
 metallized it firstly in the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.950
 main color we will put them from 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.419
 red blood so she must not be 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.620
 successful here is to admit that it is 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.629
 really what makes the color be 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.459
 really seemed to darken here then 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.709
 in the mother of pearl we are going to go to rape 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.359
 so is this going to do this effect this 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.409
 really flash glow and I find that 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.720
 it was really not bad there you see 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.389
 that suddenly it breaks the grim fact that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.699
 really makes light effects 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.229
 really cool 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.060
 then here you go back to the level 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.500
 of the secondary color appears to you 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.689
 can put a rape and I put 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.709
 the same violated so the rape is normal if 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.030
 you master the white with the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.099
 white it's also not bad I like 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.479
 to be raped and here we come to the end 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.349
 of this episode so if I had his 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.849
 colors you liked 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.709

 on these images I tell you bogen and 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.459
 shock everyone 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.669
