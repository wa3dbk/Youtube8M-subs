00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.590
 and so it will be preseason 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.539
 with wander I did not feel bad either 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.759
 I have no excuse, I think I have to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 perform for the team and I think nothing of 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.380
 bad from the personal is important the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 group iv team and I think we deserve 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 a triumph more than anything because of how we come 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 working for how we are killing him 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.519
 the week so not so many words 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.460
 now and try to show the court the 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.159
 Sunday on Saturday forgiveness and win in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.540
 It depends on serene when I said in 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.180
 selena I had to play a little bit more 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.520
 loose but not without when we were with 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.170
 I used to play alone and we had two hooks 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840
 and three forwards so I have to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 adapt to position one percent 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.289
 I also know but but good to see you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.550
 do it in the best way 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.679
 I know that I have to be the balance of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.509
 team by those who have to attack 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.509
 but good to try to do it the best 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.450
 way to be able to win but now 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.010
 the match with this last match with 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.200
 selena I think rafa was a play 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.720
 a little misfortune because he gives himself 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.190
 seeing inside the court and he is given 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.780
 back and when you have it in front of 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.300
 player and during the match 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.370
 I think it was not like for almost a 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 expulsion was a match between all 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.640
 quiet in that sense so try 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.230
 to take it quietly either 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.550
 go crazy about the subject of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.620
 expulsions we know we have to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.080
 trying to finish the onces is clear 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.000
 but well we are also confident of 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.680
 what a new expulsion and what and what are we going to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.150
 nothing we think positive that is not going to 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.340
 return to happen what came has been happening 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.770
 and that we are going to nothing and that for us 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.440
 there very well the jan leave it again 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.830
 we have to look forward to what 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.500
 what happened is already matches that were not 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.000
 they were good you have to be realistic but 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.680
 well now we look at the present the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.970
 previous match was greatly improved and 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.130
 we have to follow the same path 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.280
 we are confident that we are going to make a 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 good match but as a leader too 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.520
 So many words do not have to talk so much 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
 and now try to prove it on Saturday 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.600
 on the court and after leaving talk 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.190
 and be happy that god wants 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.310
 let's have triumph 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.990
 we are not in a process, there is little left 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.960
 I think we have to improve with 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.280
 improving match by match but here 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.350
 the reality as are the championships 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.900
 perhaps in the plenary 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.640
 and good to classify we have to determine the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.070
 best way but there will be the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 I really believe that colo colo being me 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.960
 outside I knew what color colo in a computer 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.570
 which is a big team that was to respect 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.800
 and I think we know that and that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.660
 We are confident that we will get there 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.290
 in the best way and that I'm going to classify 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.390
 and for not giving a fight to any team 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.000
 I worry that the victories give 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.850
 trust the tranquility we know that 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.490
 colo colo that comes here has to know 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.280
 what has he always wins 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.700
 tie either 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.130
 for us we do not like it but good 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.050
 as I said before thinking the last 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.490
 party and living the present we know 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.230
 that the match between us we improved a lot 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.770
 but here what we have clear everything 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.200
 what you have to win 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.640
 so let's wait this game I'm 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 confident that we're going to win and that 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.720
 we're going to have a game it's good that 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.420
 head also make goals for the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.850
 confidence because the area nine the goal 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.380
 of the team you could say but good 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.400
 I think that also the players that 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.240
 we have three quarters ahead 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.010
 they are very offensive and with a goal in my case 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.290
 with power before because this must be 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.150
 the balance of the team hopefully I can 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.580
 make a goal but but the reality is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.620
 that we hope that those who have to 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.030
 do and we be the balance and 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.880
 try that norman goal is going to be a 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.280
 hard team you have players for is 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.319
 good that they push a lot is similar 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.150
 game that makes u make the u 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.450
 and we have to try to sautÃ© 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.769
 the pressure but it's going to be a tough match 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.659
 likewise we think of our 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.609
 game in trying to be offensive 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.290
 protagonist of the first minute obvious that 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.790
 we have to know that the rival that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.349
 we have opposite plays and it will be hard 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.930
 but good now we have to try to 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.219
 focus it and focus on us and 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.219
 the people nobody makes our game
