00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
some kind of movie that you see that our

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.950 
some kind of movie that you see that our
sometime

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
sometime

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.290 
sometime
it<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.130> three<00:00:23.400> handed<00:00:23.789> bloggers

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it was it was three handed bloggers

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.229 
it was it was three handed bloggers
blind<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.310> duhamel<00:00:26.310> was<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.759> really<00:00:27.029> really

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
blind and duhamel was a really really

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.300 
blind and duhamel was a really really
aggressive<00:00:27.720> solid<00:00:28.109> player<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.919> think<00:00:29.070> he

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
aggressive solid player so I think he

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
aggressive solid player so I think he
was<00:00:29.400> very<00:00:29.429> capable<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.149> for<00:00:30.930> betting<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> know

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
was very capable of for betting you know

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
was very capable of for betting you know
five<00:00:31.679> betting<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.099> folding<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.989> quarter

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
five betting and folding there a quarter

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.160 
five betting and folding there a quarter
of<00:00:34.019> a<00:00:34.110> sec<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.390> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> had<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> over

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
of a sec so if you had to do it over

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
of a sec so if you had to do it over
again<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> same<00:00:38.220> thing<00:00:38.550> most<00:00:39.180> likely

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
again you do the same thing most likely

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
again you do the same thing most likely
yes<00:00:39.659> unfortunately<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:42.710> mean<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> sort<00:00:44.790> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
know I thought I had to read and I went

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.590 
know I thought I had to read and I went
with<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.839> I<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.500> try<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.620> trust<00:00:52.769> my<00:00:52.979> instincts

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
with it I just try to trust my instincts

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
with it I just try to trust my instincts
so<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:55.379> does<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> feel<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.670> game

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
so how does it feel from going from game

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.759 
so how does it feel from going from game
believe<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.809> making<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> final

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
believe it or not making it to the final

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.380 
believe it or not making it to the final
round<00:00:58.859> not<00:00:59.850> too<00:01:00.000> bad<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.870> mean<00:01:02.390> second

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
round not too bad actually I mean second

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
round not too bad actually I mean second
in<00:01:03.480> secondary<00:01:04.259> played<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:04.739> close<00:01:04.979> amounts

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in secondary played pretty close amounts

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
in secondary played pretty close amounts
I<00:01:05.670> guess<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.600> can't<00:01:07.020> compete<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.410> first<00:01:07.619> that's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I guess I can't compete the first that's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.279 
I guess I can't compete the first that's
kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> bummer<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:09.020> yeah<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.200> always
