 the goal is 60 years of professional license in network automation

 there is a lot of good

 the request the automaton loads this problem is that a lot of 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.850
 military makes a lot of confirmed people 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.620
 it's a big advantage see

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.690
 but the gap between what can be considered as having one year of 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.230

 in the world I adapt to the changes of an automaton nÃ®mes at least ten

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.280
 for example use the least possible budget so with this tour of

 thousands of soldiers win 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.080
 for champions 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.200
 but I think it still leaves us a lot of freedom 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560
 and the markets are not lacking anymore 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380
 80% of students 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.459
 integrates at the end of the year a company the industry in evolution 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.979
 fast demand for automation specialists everywhere in France 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.719
 to reduce costs increase the quality and accuracy the 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.879
 repeatability of tasks 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.179
 replacing 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.680
 for operators 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.539
 by machines 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.769
 automatisms 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 general whether it is currently to automate either 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.399
 relocated to areas where operators are cheaper 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.059
 only struggled does not fill up his places in goals and in pro license 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.059
 technical studies despite the opportunities do not attract 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.279
 involved a devalued image of the industry 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.279
 technician jobs and the fear of relocation 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.179
 the school is not easy to get there

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.389
 the future of this magnitude 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.340
 nevertheless these relationship quantities if we are not on the car dough this is a 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:03.309
 problem 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.070
 so I think that the cci rouzier loco 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.950
 the regions of it will take to this problem 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.359
 the university wished with professional licenses 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.839
 to solve the difficulties of insertion into the world of work 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:22.169
 today there is urgency the industry must on its side revalued the image 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.540
 of its professions for a better recruitment in these sectors
