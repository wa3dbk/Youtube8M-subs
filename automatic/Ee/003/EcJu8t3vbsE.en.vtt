00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.700
 boy once again taking a video here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
 For you, personal beauty, I'm calm. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 will also be organizing another video in the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.680
 channel and today the video is very 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 fast 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 only to make some doubts that the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 people have the sims 3 world and the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.820
 First news Grandma talking about 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.949
 the sims 3 university life and this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.529
 can be very good news for everything 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 The world that likes to play in 2003 is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.040
 consoles nÃ© 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 It's as you could see in the title. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.520
 I left half a question there for you 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.059
 see it's the sims 3 university life in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 consoles will be and we can indeed have a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 from here onwards 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 about it but it 's something that people 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 has so far been the hygiene that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.030
 tounet the 2003 university life for the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 genius consoles is a very good site yes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 very reliable for this type of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 information would not put a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 Nothing, nothing, right? 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.689
 but there is nothing confirmed done there in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.409
 no sentence or trailer image 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.030
 finished 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.580
 only there they all three 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 opponents for the consoles but also 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.680
 have to remind him that 2003 he already 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.990
 had the 2003 base right? 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 for the consoles cast enough thing 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 but in one it is not very good you play on the pc 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.420
 and it's also the wish I hope you do not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.009
 but some things are not clear to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.570
 imagination and a few more things 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.939
 when he let the staff so intrigued 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
 so then I think we need to have life 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.119
 university to come to the consoles 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.930
 have to do with something very 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.369
 different so he can sell and 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 it's worth even buying because 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.140
 otherwise it is not worth buying does not include 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.670
 enough and this can be a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 very good information and often 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 many people ask me in my 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 videos on sm3b university has to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.280
 buy consoles since a lot of people do not 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.900
 likes to play sims 3 on pc or not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.430
 I thought that it works very well. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.500
 the sims 3 store prefers to play in 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.390
 consoles then that if for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 confirmed by that you can play 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 on the streets 3 billion university in the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.130
 console that is a very good thing and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.690
 Another one to tell you is about 2003 gives 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.660
 to say that I'm seeing some 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.360
 images but I'll leave more images 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.340
 in the video description because you would not 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.800
 have to talk a lot more information 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 There is not much information and I will leave 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640
 Our mothers go to you deep down to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.070
 You guys take a look at everything right and 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.690
 they also left more and more in the 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.110
 video description for you guys to stay 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.330
 repairing well but more than anything else 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.300
 So that's it, it's just news that I 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.940
 I wanted to give it to you. It 's really short. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.990
 very short video and that's a hug 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.990

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:55.690
