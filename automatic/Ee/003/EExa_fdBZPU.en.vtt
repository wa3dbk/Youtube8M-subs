so we got a couple of Y goals which is
absolutely<00:02:05.880> key<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> knew<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> game

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.520 
important as a bit annoyed that they
scored<00:02:12.959> because<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> would

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
scored because it would

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
scored because it would
easier<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.940> back<00:02:15.180> defend<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.600> league

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810

a<00:03:29.190> short<00:03:29.579> doesn't<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.180> anything<00:03:30.540> really<00:03:30.750> and

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
a short doesn't do anything really and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.449 
a short doesn't do anything really and
yeah<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.180> did<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.890> was<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.250> good<00:03:35.400> idea

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
yeah I did that it was not a good idea

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.720 
yeah I did that it was not a good idea
looking<00:03:36.329> back<00:03:36.860> just<00:03:37.860> past<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> art<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.700> was

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
looking back just past the art it was

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.870 
looking back just past the art it was
just<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.350> g-pack<00:03:40.350> basically<00:03:40.920> Appa<00:03:41.160> ms<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.549> was

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
just the g-pack basically Appa ms I was

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.180 
just the g-pack basically Appa ms I was
trying<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.090> skip<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.540> know<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> sort<00:03:42.989> of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
trying to skip you know the sort of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.020 
trying to skip you know the sort of
cutscenes<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.430> guess<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.670> could<00:03:44.700> call<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
cutscenes I guess you could call it

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.970 
cutscenes I guess you could call it
spamming<00:03:46.019> age<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.320> pressing<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.650> able<00:03:46.890> and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
spamming age of pressing the able and

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.319 
spamming age of pressing the able and
getting<00:03:47.190> through<00:03:47.340> more<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.880> sudden<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.269> was

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
getting through more of a sudden it was

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.449 
getting through more of a sudden it was
like<00:03:48.390> 20<00:03:49.019> ha<00:03:49.350> I'd<00:03:49.530> not<00:03:49.709> realized<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.280> was

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
like 20 ha I'd not realized I was

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.949 
like 20 ha I'd not realized I was
Preston<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.269> passed<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> ball<00:03:51.750> that's

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
Preston a so it passed the ball that's

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.780 
Preston a so it passed the ball that's
the<00:03:52.140> reason<00:03:52.470> that's<00:03:53.130> thought<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.609> say

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the reason that's thought as I say

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.610 
the reason that's thought as I say
Barcelona<00:03:54.390> all<00:03:54.570> they<00:03:54.720> didn't<00:03:55.170> need<00:03:55.230> much<00:03:55.470> to

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
Barcelona all they didn't need much to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.349 
Barcelona all they didn't need much to
get<00:03:55.709> back<00:03:55.859> into<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> game<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.670> they're

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
get back into the game and they're

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.720 
get back into the game and they're
already<00:03:57.769> won<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.799> lot<00:03:59.070> not<00:03:59.370> long<00:03:59.489> after<00:03:59.579> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
already won a lot not long after the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.039 
already won a lot not long after the
games<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.090> good<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.329> believe<00:04:00.600> that's<00:04:00.720> even

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
games be good I believe that's even

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.590 
games be good I believe that's even
rocket<00:04:01.320> itch<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.060> making<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.150> one<00:04:03.329> nil

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
rocket itch and making it one nil

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.690 
rocket itch and making it one nil
however<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.350> were<00:04:04.560> not<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.430> game<00:04:05.459> you

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
however it were not out of the game you

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.520 
however it were not out of the game you
can<00:04:05.910> see<00:04:06.030> Bale<00:04:06.720> couldn't<00:04:07.079> do<00:04:07.140> anything<00:04:07.320> with

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
can see Bale couldn't do anything with

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.470 
can see Bale couldn't do anything with
it<00:04:07.560> passed<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> lab<00:04:08.519> across<00:04:08.940> there<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.329> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it passed it to a lab across there and I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.090 
it passed it to a lab across there and I
think<00:04:09.690> that's<00:04:09.810> had<00:04:09.930> my<00:04:10.079> first<00:04:10.350> cross<00:04:10.620> colon

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
think that's had my first cross colon

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.310 
think that's had my first cross colon
absolutely<00:04:11.579> ages<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.390> everyone<00:04:13.049> else<00:04:13.170> seems

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
absolutely ages and everyone else seems

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.530 
absolutely ages and everyone else seems
to<00:04:13.410> score<00:04:13.680> him<00:04:13.769> not<00:04:13.980> me<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.400> don't<00:04:15.239> really<00:04:15.329> go

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
to score him not me I don't really go

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.360 
to score him not me I don't really go
for<00:04:15.720> them<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.739> like<00:04:16.859> drilled<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.340> into

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
for them but I just like drilled it into

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.020 
one or so at this point we'd be going
through<00:04:22.500> however<00:04:23.130> they<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.430> back<00:04:23.610> into<00:04:23.849> the
