 little bit good I will tell my 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 experience yesterday afternoon before 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 upload the game when it comes from the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.030
 gym as it puts me to the computer and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.100
 said continue the game is going down and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.629
 all history to upload it to the page and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.579
 what the hell I passed my computer 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.739
 using me they were going to the computer I was super 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.290
 slow or it was like a bike without 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.300
 pedals since I was not walking 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.510
 the time can be the best the virus 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 this report and the virus is what it does 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.840
 is minear minar means that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 with your method you your ram memory will 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 consume all your ram memory for example 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.130
 I was one hundred percent 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.720
 RAM 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.550
 I did not walk that achieved nothing come 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 as if I know as if it's not going to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.960
 work and I said okay, I 'm going to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.690
 restart and it will not restart the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.400
 computer I took and 14 the antivirus to 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.680
 the latest version I have for example 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.380
 you're going eat here and made an analysis 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.450
 full of my truth a century later 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520
 but well , nothing good happens too 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's explain how you can look 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.500
 for if you have the virus the active virus 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.009
 and on your computer goes slowly good 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.050
 so let's go here to the bar down here 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.240
 right button start administration of 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.830
 tasks to me for example I do not get out I do not know 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 why but good you have to follow 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.740
 these steps we have to go to processes and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.420
 in processes to the right puts cpu in cpu 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.600
 and puts the percent what 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.310
 consume and if you see something that consumes 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.650
 very much 60 percent 70-80 will pass 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.170
 antivirus that you have the virus active and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.140
 is undermining worth that's information 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 important good and now I'm going to apply it 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.380
 so a little bit above what after the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.560
 version of errors and what goes into the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 p2p version and how to enter the language 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 Spanish the Italian and the new crack 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.500
 well as you will see here, the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.760
 game is the roll version of here 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.470
 important is the good p2p version 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.090
 first of all if you have the version of 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.910
 pieces of descent does not go down and the one above 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.670
 of you only have to put this to the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.610
 p2p version and you 're not going to download 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.080
 thirteen gigas again for that I see it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.930
 silly but good I go a 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.000
 short advice and today we are going to put the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.260
 Spanish language to see in the version of 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.299
 p2p 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.430
 let's open a folder we open this 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:31.409
 folder we copy this data win 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.719
