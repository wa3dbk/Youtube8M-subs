00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 now if you love your wives or 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.259
 if you yourself you go how i do it 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.650
 then I will tell one little nuance about 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.860
 how to bring chopper to mind and so in chopper 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 very important and the corner here is this corner 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.080
 very often have exactly the corner 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.850
 dig so that's what to do in principle 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 could be a corner every time 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.529
 sharpen individual could even 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 here these side faces sharpen but when 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 this type of corner is very quickly erased 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.430
 getting round chopper too 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 decreases in size and in general it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.899
 not practical once i tried 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 Odesa this corner is not fast 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.629
 it becomes so on the same principle 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.390
 as i showed with a knife motokosy 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.789
 so on the same principle we act 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.280
 and here about the knife motokosy can 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.789
 watch another video what we do 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 with this corner this corner if we take off 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 near this shark quite go straight line 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 and then suddenly expanding 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.270
 Means that here is made here about rive 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 she about klepa on she became thinner but 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.510
 It will also be already partially cut so became 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 wider and at the same time the corner became sharp 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.909
 and this is the rest is not relevant 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.890
 pupa she already sharpened that is herself 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.150
 chopper let grind down over the years all 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 equal this will happen 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 and the corner we just clip and this one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 partial face 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
 and here is this piece on rivet how 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.970
 way the corner is saved at the same time 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.610
 he is sharp serves for a long time and such a chopper 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 if you look she will shoot down 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.180
 even quite so thick 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.659
 still for example adult clover or 8 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.700
 or Vanka cuts off period 8 look 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.409
 cuts off such a chopper is already checked 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.509
 natural here it will be necessary 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.790
 regularly undermine and dress up too 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.220
 periodically yell though not so 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.420
 often how to sharpen here they hold on longer 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.570
 I will show one more nuance usually 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.509
 I do understand that they are part of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.939
 the ground at this angle 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.500
 pretty big so it is not so 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.780
 but at a large angle and, accordingly 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.380
 such a chopper is good just to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.060
 she make rows so break through or pits 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.430
 only for this she is good 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.070
 chop off and this is just the most 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050
 chopper leads time must be bent 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 so that our almost parallel to the ground 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.270
 that is, against the background of the shop, I will show it 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.640
 It should not be here so it's almost 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.510
 parallel to the earth what is there to do 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.100
 here it is necessary to heat on some fire 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.360
 bend and and usually it is done under 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.250
 such an angle that enters very ground 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.350
 pulls out simple we are so here it is necessary 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.120
 bend so when it will land 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.390
 going almost parallel will just 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.720
 still 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.050
 shave the weeds and so remember the corner we 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.420
 rivet here we sharpen and stick 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.970
 this angle that she tore a hole 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.010
 so she walks parallel to the ground such 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.420
 chopper will work just one 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420
 what pleasure do you want
