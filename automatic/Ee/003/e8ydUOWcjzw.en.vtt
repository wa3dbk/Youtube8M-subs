00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.250 

so<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.250> way<00:00:05.340> we<00:00:05.460> make<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.640> Manhattan<00:00:06.149> we<00:00:07.080> can

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.260 
so the way we make a Manhattan we can

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.260 
so the way we make a Manhattan we can
either<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:07.500> American<00:00:08.430> whiskey<00:00:08.760> either<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
either use American whiskey either a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.289 
either use American whiskey either a
bourbon<00:00:10.049> whiskey<00:00:10.379> or<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> rye<00:00:11.240> originally<00:00:12.240> in

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
bourbon whiskey or a rye originally in

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.480 
bourbon whiskey or a rye originally in
Manhattan<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:12.869> made<00:00:13.199> with<00:00:13.650> rye<00:00:14.070> whiskey

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
Manhattan was made with rye whiskey

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
Manhattan was made with rye whiskey
because<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:15.240> originated<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.840> east<00:00:16.049> coast

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
because it originated on the east coast

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590 
because it originated on the east coast
and<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> East<00:00:16.710> Coast<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.400> where<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.270> came<00:00:18.539> from

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and the East Coast was where I came from

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.749 
and the East Coast was where I came from
and<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> Midwest<00:00:19.769> where<00:00:20.339> bourbon

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
and it was in the Midwest where bourbon

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.429 
and it was in the Midwest where bourbon
came<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:21.179> and<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.779> any<00:00:21.900> drink<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.230> was

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
came from and so any drink that was

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349 
came from and so any drink that was
invented<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.369> East<00:00:23.550> Coast<00:00:23.849> with<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
invented on the East Coast with a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.909 
invented on the East Coast with a
whiskey<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.839> it<00:00:24.900> would<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.199> used<00:00:25.349> her<00:00:25.710> rye

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
whiskey in it would have used her rye

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.499 
whiskey in it would have used her rye
whiskey<00:00:26.339> so<00:00:26.460> I'm<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.789> use<00:00:26.910> rye<00:00:27.089> whiskey

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
whiskey so I'm going to use rye whiskey

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.749 
whiskey so I'm going to use rye whiskey
for<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.499> good<00:00:28.710> bourbon<00:00:28.919> works<00:00:29.490> as

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
for this but a good bourbon works as

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.689 
for this but a good bourbon works as
well<00:00:29.939> too<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:32.480> like<00:00:33.480> using<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:34.699> three-to-one

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
well too I like using a three-to-one

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.569 
well too I like using a three-to-one
ratio<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.570> bourbon<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> whiskey<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.100> sweet

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
ratio of bourbon or a whiskey and sweet

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.790 
ratio of bourbon or a whiskey and sweet
vermouth<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:40.199> parts<00:00:40.590> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
vermouth so that's three parts of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.599 
vermouth so that's three parts of
whiskey<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:42.149> part<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.960> sweet<00:00:43.260> vermouth

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
whiskey in one part of sweet vermouth

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.830 
whiskey in one part of sweet vermouth
whatever<00:00:44.609> the<00:00:44.760> measures<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.420> might<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
whatever the measures you might want to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
whatever the measures you might want to
have<00:00:46.020> works<00:00:46.680> fine<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.940> particular

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
have works fine on it in this particular

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.849 
have works fine on it in this particular
drink<00:00:48.570> since<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.199> have<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> slightly

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
drink since they have it a slightly

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.189 
drink since they have it a slightly
larger<00:00:50.129> cocktail<00:00:51.059> glass<00:00:51.269> here<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.750> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
larger cocktail glass here and I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.599 
larger cocktail glass here and I'm
assuming<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.190> having<00:00:53.370> maybe

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
assuming I'm going to be having maybe

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.910 
assuming I'm going to be having maybe
just<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.180> cocktail<00:00:54.480> tonight<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.679> going<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
just one cocktail tonight I'm going to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:13.630

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.910 

and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.270> I'm<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:16.380> three

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then I'm going to use about three

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:31.960 
and then I'm going to use about three
quarters<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.880> ounce<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.240> sweet<00:01:19.230> vermouth

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.460 

one<00:01:32.970> thing<00:01:33.150> interesting<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.780> something<00:01:34.380> like

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
one thing interesting on something like

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.410 
one thing interesting on something like
a<00:01:34.530> Manhattan<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> combining<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.120> sweet

ratios<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:39.870> might<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.290> change<00:01:40.710> just

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
ratios are might actually change just

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.260 
ratios are might actually change just
slightly<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.210> to

slightly when you're really going to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.820 
slightly when you're really going to
become<00:01:42.390> an<00:01:42.570> expert<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> depending<00:01:43.740> upon

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
become an expert at it depending upon

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.920 
become an expert at it depending upon
what<00:01:44.610> sweet<00:01:44.910> vermouth<00:01:45.180> you're<00:01:45.330> using<00:01:45.540> and

properly balancing one against another

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.820 
properly balancing one against another
you<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.210> want<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.480> whiskey<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> taste<00:01:58.200> too

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
you don't want the whiskey to taste too

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
once was saying that that couldn't have

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.420 
once was saying that that couldn't have
happened<00:02:27.989> because<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.739> only<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.159> she<00:02:29.400> could

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
happened because the only time she could

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.490 
happened because the only time she could
have<00:02:29.819> done<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.359> New<00:02:30.659> York<00:02:30.959> from<00:02:31.290> time

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
standpoint she actually wasn't in New

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
standpoint she actually wasn't in New
York<00:02:33.329> she<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.689> England<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.500> that's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
York she was in England and so that's

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
York she was in England and so that's
not<00:02:34.829> where<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.069> came<00:02:35.189> from<00:02:35.329> what<00:02:36.329> actually

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
and basically they were the exact same

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.229 
and basically they were the exact same
cocktail<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.519> Manhattan<00:02:53.970> Club<00:02:54.120> I

guess was more popular and so their

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.460 
guess was more popular and so their

more<00:02:58.650> popular<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.220> that's<00:02:59.609> why<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.909> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
more popular and that's why we have the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:17.990 
more popular and that's why we have the
Manhattan<00:03:00.389> today<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.459> notice<00:03:17.849> I'm

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
Manhattan today now you notice I'm

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.210 
Manhattan today now you notice I'm
stirring<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.260> cocktail<00:03:19.530> with<00:03:19.859> ice<00:03:20.010> rather

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
stirring this cocktail with ice rather

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.339 
stirring this cocktail with ice rather
than<00:03:20.370> shaking<00:03:20.849> it<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.030> there's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.810> very<00:03:22.109> good

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
than shaking it and there's a very good

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.170 
than shaking it and there's a very good
reason<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.979> if<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.579> were<00:03:23.699> to<00:03:23.729> shake<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
reason for that if I were to shake it

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.449 
reason for that if I were to shake it
the<00:03:24.569> drink<00:03:24.750> would<00:03:24.930> end<00:03:25.079> up<00:03:25.199> having<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.859> crusty

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the drink would end up having a crusty

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.640 
the drink would end up having a crusty
foam<00:03:26.729> on<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.269> top<00:03:27.449> of<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.379> well<00:03:28.560> as

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
foam on the top of it and as well as

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.009 
foam on the top of it and as well as
being<00:03:28.680> rather<00:03:28.949> cloudy<00:03:29.479> that<00:03:30.479> comes<00:03:30.750> from<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
being rather cloudy that comes from the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.330 
being rather cloudy that comes from the
sweet<00:03:31.199> vermouth<00:03:31.379> that's<00:03:31.769> being<00:03:31.919> added<00:03:32.250> that

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
sweet vermouth that's being added that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830 
sweet vermouth that's being added that
is<00:03:32.459> actually<00:03:32.760> holding<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.269> air<00:03:33.359> bubbles<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
is actually holding the air bubbles and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.990 
is actually holding the air bubbles and
foaming<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.590> slightly<00:03:34.859> on<00:03:34.979> top<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
foaming up slightly on top and so you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.819 
foaming up slightly on top and so you
always<00:03:36.180> want<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.449> take<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> stir<00:03:37.199> a<00:03:37.229> cocktail

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
always want to take in a stir a cocktail

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.039 
always want to take in a stir a cocktail
that<00:03:38.010> has<00:03:38.340> all<00:03:38.489> clear<00:03:38.879> ingredients<00:03:39.479> in<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.690> so

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
that has all clear ingredients in it so

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.479 
that has all clear ingredients in it so
you<00:03:40.109> don't<00:03:40.319> get<00:03:40.470> either<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.739> foamy<00:03:40.979> top<00:03:41.250> or

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
you don't get either the foamy top or

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:58.580 
you don't get either the foamy top or
the<00:03:41.729> cloudiness<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.419> dress

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.629 

stirring<00:03:59.590> takes<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.829> little<00:03:59.920> bit<00:04:00.040> longer<00:04:00.189> then

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
stirring takes a little bit longer then

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.500 
stirring takes a little bit longer then
shaking<00:04:00.909> does<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.189> melt<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.969> ice<00:04:04.090> melt<00:04:04.420> a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
shaking does but the melt the ice melt a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.089 
shaking does but the melt the ice melt a
little<00:04:04.569> bit<00:04:04.719> slower<00:04:05.019> and<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.590> gets<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:05.920> as

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
little bit slower and it gets just as

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.740 
little bit slower and it gets just as
cold<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.579> so<00:04:06.819> stirring<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.329> shaking<00:04:07.659> are

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
cold and so stirring and shaking are

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:18.330 
cold and so stirring and shaking are
basically<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.500> exact<00:04:08.829> same<00:04:17.160> now<00:04:18.160> another

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
basically the exact same now another

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.710 
basically the exact same now another
thing<00:04:18.430> comes<00:04:18.849> up<00:04:19.030> with<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.329> Manhattan
