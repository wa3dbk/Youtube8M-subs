00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
both of them more about raw pace it was

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459 
both of them more about raw pace it was
just<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> sword<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.259> him

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
just that sword that had more about him

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.350 
just that sword that had more about him
because<00:02:04.710> dickhead<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> winger

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
because dickhead was more like a winger

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.930 
because dickhead was more like a winger
type<00:02:07.110> player<00:02:07.320> moved<00:02:07.560> into<00:02:07.710> Center<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
type player moved into Center so it's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
type player moved into Center so it's
more<00:02:09.060> about<00:02:09.119> him<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.539> running<00:02:09.899> forward<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
more about him just running forward and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.930 
more about him just running forward and
he<00:02:10.739> had<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> decent<00:02:11.160> shot<00:02:11.430> him<00:02:11.610> he<00:02:11.670> could<00:02:11.819> also

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
he had a decent shot him he could also

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
he had a decent shot him he could also
across<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> times<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:12.840> needed

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
across the times when needed

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.410 
across the times when needed
and<00:02:13.409> thought<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.430> was<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.999> complete

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and thought that was just the complete

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
and thought that was just the complete
more<00:02:15.749> forward<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.409> in<00:02:16.560> he<00:02:16.709> was<00:02:16.829> a<00:02:16.859> jack<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.189> all

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
more forward as in he was a jack of all

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.099 
more forward as in he was a jack of all
trades<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.879> food<00:02:18.090> price<00:02:18.389> you<00:02:18.599> could<00:02:18.719> not<00:02:18.959> go

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
trades and food price you could not go

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.259 
trades and food price you could not go
wrong<00:02:19.139> he<00:02:19.439> was<00:02:19.469> one<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.879> actually<00:02:20.879> enjoyed<00:02:21.090> him

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
wrong he was one of actually enjoyed him

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.509 
wrong he was one of actually enjoyed him
a<00:02:21.329> lot<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.719> I<00:02:22.019> think<00:02:22.049> if<00:02:22.469> it<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:22.889> team<00:02:23.189> where

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
a lot and I think if it was a team where

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.979 
a lot and I think if it was a team where
instead<00:02:23.939> of<00:02:23.999> just<00:02:24.239> having<00:02:24.389> them<00:02:24.629> both<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
instead of just having them both the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.089 
instead of just having them both the
everyone<00:02:25.260> let<00:02:25.409> them<00:02:25.499> do<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.799> they<00:02:25.829> want

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
everyone let them do what they want

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.000 
everyone let them do what they want
immediate<00:02:26.969> purely<00:02:27.629> focused<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.260> saw<00:02:28.499> down<00:02:28.799> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
immediate purely focused on saw down I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
immediate purely focused on saw down I
think<00:02:29.939> we<00:02:30.090> could<00:02:30.269> have<00:02:30.299> scored<00:02:30.450> an<00:02:30.689> absolute

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
think we could have scored an absolute

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.339 
think we could have scored an absolute
bag<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.250> together<00:02:32.639> because<00:02:33.180> he<00:02:33.659> just<00:02:33.900> felt

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
bag for together because he just felt

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.250 
bag for together because he just felt
like<00:02:34.590> such<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.639> really<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.689> accomplished

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
like such a really good and accomplished

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.500 
like such a really good and accomplished
striker<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.129> really<00:02:38.519> enjoyed<00:02:38.879> him<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.299> kid

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
striker and I really enjoyed him I kid

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.470 
striker and I really enjoyed him I kid
the<00:02:39.659> pace<00:02:40.069> he<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.549> was<00:02:41.639> a<00:02:41.700> nice<00:02:41.909> chip<00:02:42.299> from

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the pace he that was a nice chip from

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.509 
the pace he that was a nice chip from
him<00:02:42.659> while<00:02:43.109> he<00:02:43.290> could<00:02:43.530> score<00:02:43.859> quite<00:02:44.219> nice

goals<00:02:44.879> like<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> lot<00:02:45.389> of<00:02:45.419> them<00:02:45.569> were<00:02:45.750> triangles

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
goals like a lot of them were triangles

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.289 
goals like a lot of them were triangles
that<00:02:46.439> he<00:02:46.620> scored<00:02:46.829> himself<00:02:47.010> from<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.150> was

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and I didn't really have many bad words

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.729 
and I didn't really have many bad words
to<00:02:53.519> survive<00:02:53.849> maybe<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.959> he<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.469> a<00:02:55.530> perfect

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
to survive maybe if he was in a perfect

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.939 
to survive maybe if he was in a perfect
world<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:58.019> him<00:02:58.139> or<00:02:58.260> plat<00:02:58.469> higher<00:02:58.680> rate

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
world we to get him or plat higher rate

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.530 
maybe put him up a couple of inches to 5
11<00:03:03.000> 16<00:03:03.569> 64<00:03:04.379> maybe<00:03:05.310> give<00:03:05.730> him<00:03:05.819> four<00:03:06.150> star<00:03:06.359> week

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
11 16 64 maybe give him four star week

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.729 
11 16 64 maybe give him four star week
for<00:03:06.780> four<00:03:07.079> star<00:03:07.319> skill<00:03:07.620> moves<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.989> then<00:03:09.989> he

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
for four star skill moves and then he

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.740 
for four star skill moves and then he
would<00:03:10.889> have<00:03:10.980> been<00:03:11.189> absolutely<00:03:11.310> perfect<00:03:12.209> so

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
would have been absolutely perfect so

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.759 
would have been absolutely perfect so
that's<00:03:12.930> why<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:13.169> getting<00:03:13.469> shot<00:03:13.590> down<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
that's why it's getting shot down a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.959 
that's why it's getting shot down a
