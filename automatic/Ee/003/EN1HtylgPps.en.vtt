00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.960
 up there we threaten to take him rehn and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 throw it 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 and we think that the workers 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 you have to fix you always have to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.220
 consolidate that base, rely on the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 true workers because we 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.510
 let's say that the work of more work 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.510
 of all the workers 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.909
 students are already saying and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 speaking very clearly that we 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:03.280
 we wanted to change the system 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.340
 the night found a very good solution 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.290
 to blow up the rise is not true 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.479
 sometimes I think it has as a 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.030
 correlate of what was happening in the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.720
 country and is going through the crisis almost 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.720
 calcada 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.680
 marcelo 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.600
 until the equipment is removed 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 security and we read the laws themselves 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.650
 security, we have control 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.940
 strength security worker 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 in 74 for three days he had taken this 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.240
 plant apparently the only way to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 convince the authorities of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.220
 showing him that one is every day more 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.220
 strong 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.660
 it was very difficult to be able to pose in this 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.190
 case where I was 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.190
 what happened to Peronism 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.740
 we know what we are on the side of the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 homeland and we know what is beyond 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.299
 Homeland 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 it was a time of class struggle in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.950
 that the workers have 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.900
 there were lots of things that were 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.770
 all the Peronism had covered me 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.710
 agreement that in a demonstration there was 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.470
 flags with the head behind that the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.010
 head of lenin the head of hammer and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.690
 a black that was my thing says that if 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.690
 it was that center 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.160
 the workers force the bureaucracy 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.500
 to call a general strike the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.780
 first general strike they take 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.050
 forward the workers to a government 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.050
 Peronist 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.599
 Hahaha
