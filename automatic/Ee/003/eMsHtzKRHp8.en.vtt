00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello my dear and very warmly 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.279
 welcome pretty early on 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.540
 It's not Sunday morning, actually 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.910
 More so early it is somehow 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.770
 10 o'clock and this video should 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.680
 actually go online at 11 so if 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.599
 should do that then the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.309
 chemical little wonder with me 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.070
 I cursed this morning 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.040
 have no beginning of my video 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.739
 and therefore helps since start there 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.290
 in any case, 53 ideas full with 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.329
 me and all the ideas that turn 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.239
 So a little bit about the summer theme 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.250
 this is the first official video in 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.780
 This year from me and that has me 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 somehow very happy because 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.820
 I 'm sick of bad 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.170
 weather and I do not know sometime 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.059
 I will probably emigrate 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.319
 because it's the weather here 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.420
 just not enough 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.280
 Do you know what I mean 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.080
 no matter we just do it like we did 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.530
 we already know 30 degrees outside 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.150
 clip with the video so first show 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.310
 I just like you many like this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.780
 can do top and I bet you have 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.040
 what you need for this at home 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.690
 it's just one 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 closure book what you need for it 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.460
 and that folds into a triangle 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.500
 together and then you take the top 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.140
 from the triangle and simply bind it 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.610
 Your neck makes a knot and you 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 Actually, every book can be next to it 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.990
 I recommend something to you with Maria 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 out 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.860
 to take the lighter and thinner material 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 because that's just so little 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.600
 beautiful body adapts and stops 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 bit more fluently and then have 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 I just take the sides of the triangle 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.689
 taken and the back at the back 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.689
 tied together 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.540
 Yes 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.799
 and in the end it looks like this and me 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.049
 I would not go to school now 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.700
 but on the weekend you want to leave and 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.190
 it was useful or is it rhinestone or 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.560
 Really really nice and know 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.000
 from scapa and next there are 21 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 recipes once for one 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.100
 fruit yoghurt 1 and 1 world for emergency workers 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.510
 and everything you need for it 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.670
 now, once so little squirrel 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.140
 i bought mine at karstadt i 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 that also gives you a link below where you are 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.020
 they get even but can you can 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.880
 otherwise just no bowls 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.739
 take her home and now 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 I have for the model as first 100 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.470
 milliliters of cream pitched and then 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 I have so two three teaspoons 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.970
 pay back canada and two tablespoons 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 I mixed it all up again and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.519
 then just a few shoes per bouquets 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.010
 done that 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.420
 I think they end up as the ice 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.209
 Frozen was really nice again 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.519
 have just tasted that in mine 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.930
 in form and right this little one 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.090
 bowl you see I have too 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 just filled in because I'm not so early 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.120
 as a form 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.330
 So you can do that easily 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.710
 and then later spoon that out and that 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.720
 second must definitely be something 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.330
 healthier and although I have four now 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.370
 Teaspoon of Greek magnifying glass taken 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.910
 a little sugar done and one 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.740
 bit of lemon juice then I'm not 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.260
 Fruits that are now any 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.240
 filled with small bowls and simply with 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.030
 a little orange juice so half 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.060
 infused and then came the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.130
 yogurt and yet it is also very 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.730
 made fast is definitely one 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.030
 healthy alternative becomes too much and 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.860
 then the whole thing came once in 48 and 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.630
 there has only six seven hours 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.870
 left in about it completely 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.130
 was frozen and now look at this 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.330
 and the best, it is quite the taste 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.330
 hoffeld how it looks 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.660
 in the third league it is in the flip 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.680
 go and I'll show you how 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.720
 her embellish this a little bit 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.510
 can flip flops so there really 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.310
 with 23 euros on each corner and everything 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.160
 i did a cloth in now 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.780
 to cut two halves and I would 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.040
 recommend you to take a thin cloth 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.209
 so that you can do it well later 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.550
 flipflops can wrap 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.959
 that is the only thing that is 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.160
 now for matip and it is like that 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.840
 simple and I am that it 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.430
 probably not just the flip flops 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.930
 total but it also makes them more 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.790
 convenient because everything is so high a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.910
 little soft market and upholstered and 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 the skin is not so much of the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.720
 people and you can either 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.729
 The cloth now only on these straps 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.190
 fix it or you do it like me 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.669
 did it now you knotted stoke 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.950
 still in the back together at the heel and 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.810
 then you can do it like this 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.420
 the samples in sandals if the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.320
 Do not just call it calf 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.790
 Tie up a bit and then lie 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.350
 that later on and I could 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.780
 Imagine that of a jeans shorts 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.850
 looks and feels really nice in the summer 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.550
 also very comfortable and the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.870
 flip flops hold better on the foot if you 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.580
 I'll show you four times like yours 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.140
 you can make your own peeling and me 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.180
 bet you have all the ingredients for it 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.550
 At home is two tablespoons 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.170
 sugar 2 tablespoons cafÃ© you can too 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.730
 just the coffee set so from tomorrow 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.100
 So take that can be brought quietly 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.290
 and then a little oil of your choice me 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.030
 have now taken olive oil and then 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.640
 you mix it all in one 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.280
 bowl up this little unappetizing 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.870
 But the pump is hit 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.480
 cool on the scrub it contains 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.160
 Caffeine and caffeine stirs a bit 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.810
 the blood circulation and that it 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.450
 especially then it's cool when the skin 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.910
 a little bit the haller and smoother 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.920
 want to look and what also cool 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.300
 The oil in cinemas nourishes the skin 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.290
 really go and you need it 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.200
 actually not more after that 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.670
 cream because that's all there 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.810
 fly with moisture now 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.000
 and then we come to the last one 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.950
 idea and that's where I do a first 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.150
 breakdown mask you know maybe if 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.980
 you've been watching my videos for a while 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.960
 that I have this strawberry mask from stevens 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.670
 I think it's extremely good and I got it today 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.440
 I just think about it 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.290
 myself and although I have for three 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720
 doctors and a bit cream and one 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.090
 bit honey so a tablespoon of it in 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.310
 a little bowl so yes again 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.350
 one is mixed and easy with 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.180
 a grazer presses and with that came that 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.710
 whole just directly to the mean 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.300
 couch with you in any case always 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.130
 beforehand that is very important if you are 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.960
 mast used and the mask is full 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.550
 of good ingredients for example 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.130
 the strawberries contain different 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.810
 acids even if the oleic acid is so 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.500
 against pimples and acne and so prevent 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.270
 should 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.980
 The honey is anti-inflammatory and 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.390
 In addition, the cream donates then too 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.220
 still a bit damp and 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.870
 cares for the skin and the best thing about it 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.740
 Skin feels really extreme afterwards 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.680
 good at 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.750
 And those were the three tips from me 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.820
 So if you cried something like that 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.800
 does and imitate over the building from 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.600
 then just send it to me on twitter 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.910
 or instagram I have now 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.070
 a verified twitter account and 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.740
 I do not remember just because incidentally 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.270
 that somehow I do not know what 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.980
 would change to my twitter account 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.400
 but somehow I am with these 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.990
 hook up next to a friend generali around 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.200
 every case left will open in the 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:58.020
 infobox and i am looking forward to yours 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.430
 news and that 's it I forget 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.500
 save the video to them 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.500
 if it's good and see you next time
