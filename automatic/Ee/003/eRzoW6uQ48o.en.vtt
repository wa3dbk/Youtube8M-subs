good game and I'm today I'll be for the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.600 
good game and I'm today I'll be for the
first<00:00:08.670> time<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:09.929> model<00:00:10.280> yeah<00:00:11.280> they're

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
first time so in my model yeah they're

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.009 
first time so in my model yeah they're
going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.790> launch<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.360> hold<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.809> radio

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
going to launch and hold the radio

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.950 
going to launch and hold the radio
control<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> other<00:00:13.530> hand<00:00:13.940> okay<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.870> i<00:00:15.900> just

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
control the other hand okay now i just

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.490 
control the other hand okay now i just
want<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.199> show<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.800> got<00:00:16.980> here

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
want to show you on what we've got here

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.189 
want to show you on what we've got here
we've<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.859> over<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:21.930> while<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
we've got over here and now while you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.400 
we've got over here and now while you
can<00:00:22.260> say<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.180> missile<00:00:24.689> which

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
can say that but we have a missile which

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
can say that but we have a missile which
will<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.619> dropped<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> kinetics<00:00:26.599> we

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
will be dropped from the kinetics we

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.700 
will be dropped from the kinetics we
also<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:29.750> camera<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> can

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
also have a camera and now all you can

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.410 
also have a camera and now all you can
say<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:33.290> attach<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.530> parachute<00:00:35.270> which<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
say that attach to a parachute which is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
say that attach to a parachute which is
going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> fall<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> kinetics<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:38.850> also

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going to fall from the kinetics we also

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.080 
going to fall from the kinetics we also
have<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.829> thomas's<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.969> my

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
have this is thomas's now this is my

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
have this is thomas's now this is my
p-51<00:00:42.600> mustang<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:45.210> also<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:46.250> another

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
p-51 mustang and we also have another

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840 
p-51 mustang and we also have another
paper<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> Mustang<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.200> oh<00:00:50.160> what's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
paper to a Mustang here and oh what's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
paper to a Mustang here and oh what's
that<00:00:50.940> looks<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.690> an<00:00:51.840> f-35<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.680> paper

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that looks like an f-35 see a paper

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.369 
that looks like an f-35 see a paper
model<00:00:53.280> yeah<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:54.989> ring<00:00:55.260> on

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
model yeah and it's got a little ring on

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.729 
model yeah and it's got a little ring on
it<00:00:55.850> wonder<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.149> do<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.739> how

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it wonder what we can do with that how

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
it wonder what we can do with that how
about<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.010> arms<00:00:59.489> drop<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> kinetics<00:01:00.390> sands

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
about we arms drop of the kinetics sands

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.520 
about we arms drop of the kinetics sands
like<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> plan

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.250 

oh<00:01:13.369> hey<00:01:14.369> guys<00:01:14.610> um<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.479> I'm<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.960> doing

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
oh hey guys um now I'm actually doing

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.510 
oh hey guys um now I'm actually doing
the<00:01:16.619> UM<00:01:16.740> viewing<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> um<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:20.400> will

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the UM viewing and um this time we will

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.890 
the UM viewing and um this time we will
be<00:01:20.670> dropping<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> f-35<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:23.009> pilot<00:01:23.750> wish<00:01:24.750> me

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
be dropping the f-35 a pilot wish me

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.969 
be dropping the f-35 a pilot wish me
luck<00:01:24.930> i<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
luck i don't know how this is going to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.260 
luck i don't know how this is going to
go<00:01:26.159> because<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.850> blowing<00:01:27.090> around

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
go because this is blowing around

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
go because this is blowing around
everywhere<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> call<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.790> issues

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
everywhere it's got to call some issues

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
everywhere it's got to call some issues
i'm<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.390> sure<00:01:30.509> i'm<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.020> up

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
i'm not sure i'm going to get it up

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.859 
i'm not sure i'm going to get it up
without<00:01:31.259> damage<00:01:32.190> in<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.399> paper<00:01:32.580> model<00:01:32.880> we'll

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
without damage in the paper model we'll

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.840 
without damage in the paper model we'll
see<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.140> yeah<00:01:35.330> here<00:01:36.330> we<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.700> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
see how we go yeah here we go this is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.669 
see how we go yeah here we go this is
paper<00:01:42.149> plane<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.759> underbelly<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.910> the

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
paper plane on the underbelly of the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.560 
paper plane on the underbelly of the
kinetics<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.910> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.210> exciting

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
kinetics this is going to be exciting

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.590 
kinetics this is going to be exciting
Drago<00:01:49.289> him<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:51.000> sense<00:01:51.270> you've<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Drago him and make sense you've got to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.919 
Drago him and make sense you've got to
be<00:01:51.659> careful<00:01:51.840> too<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:53.570> suggest<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> drop<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
be careful too I suggest you drop it

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.020 
be careful too I suggest you drop it
about<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.319> it's<00:01:55.590> gonna<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.920> far<00:01:58.970> it's<00:01:59.970> a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
about here it's gonna get far it's a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.550 
about here it's gonna get far it's a
fine<00:02:01.670> smashing<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:03.450> our<00:02:03.690> plain<00:02:04.080> folks

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
fine smashing there's our plain folks

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.760 
fine smashing there's our plain folks
arm<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.610> first<00:02:05.970> test<00:02:06.330> failed<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.140> believe

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
arm that first test failed I believe

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.050 
arm that first test failed I believe
that's<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.519> propeller<00:02:08.910> was

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that's because the propeller was

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
that's because the propeller was
actually<00:02:09.390> pushing<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> winds<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.530> wings

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
actually pushing the winds the wings

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.460 
actually pushing the winds the wings
down<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.390> run<00:02:12.569> time<00:02:12.690> monett

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
down so just kind of run time monett

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.229 
down so just kind of run time monett
here<00:02:13.650> drill<00:02:13.890> or<00:02:14.190> whatever<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.700> opposite<00:02:15.180> of

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
here drill or whatever the opposite of

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
here drill or whatever the opposite of
dihedral<00:02:15.750> scold<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.350> that's<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.100> happens

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
dihedral scold and that's what happens

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
dihedral scold and that's what happens
it's<00:02:17.910> really<00:02:18.420> windy<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:19.320> really

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's really windy so we're really

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.810
