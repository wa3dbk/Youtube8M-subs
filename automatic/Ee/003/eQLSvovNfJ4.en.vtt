all year I'll see what happens but I

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
think it's a good way to push myself and

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.610 
think it's a good way to push myself and
learn<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.790> songs<00:01:43.030> will<00:01:43.660> become<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> little

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
learn and the songs will become a little

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.760 
learn and the songs will become a little
bit<00:01:44.710> more<00:01:44.860> complex<00:01:45.780> hopefully<00:01:46.780> throughout
