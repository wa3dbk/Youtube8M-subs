use to play brighter website so the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.290 
use to play brighter website so the
first<00:00:09.719> step<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.230> simply<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> sign<00:00:11.280> up<00:00:11.490> we've

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
first step is simply to sign up we've

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640 
first step is simply to sign up we've
tried<00:00:12.509> really<00:00:12.540> hard<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.170> make<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.500> as

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
tried really hard to make this as

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
tried really hard to make this as
painless<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:14.280> possible<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.330> shouldn't

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
painless as possible so you shouldn't

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.529 
painless as possible so you shouldn't
have<00:00:15.780> any<00:00:15.900> difficulty<00:00:16.970> just<00:00:17.970> answering<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> few

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
have any difficulty just answering a few

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.720 
have any difficulty just answering a few
questions<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:19.410> yourself<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.630> your<00:00:21.630> school

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
questions about yourself and your school

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.859 
questions about yourself and your school
so<00:00:23.730> we're<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.210> an<00:00:24.420> email<00:00:24.720> address

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.959 

we're<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> need<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> password<00:00:32.630> and

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
we're going to need a password and

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.000 
we're going to need a password and
that's<00:00:35.969> essentially<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> now<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.680> click

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
that's essentially it and now we click

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.930 
that's essentially it and now we click
register<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> we're<00:00:39.239> into<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> wheel<00:00:39.719> site

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
register and we're into the wheel site

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
register and we're into the wheel site
now<00:00:41.940> we've<00:00:42.120> created<00:00:42.300> Hollyoaks<00:00:42.870> school<00:00:43.350> but

what those students will need to get

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.510 
what those students will need to get
into<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.820> site<00:01:16.040> don't<00:01:17.040> want<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> print<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
into the site don't want to print it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.550 
into the site don't want to print it
just<00:01:17.729> yet<00:01:17.970> though<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.600> first<00:01:19.170> there's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
just yet though because first there's

be a biology teacher so we're going to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.670 
be a biology teacher so we're going to
head<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.700> over<00:01:38.820> search<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.810> biology<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
head on over search for biology in the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.670 
head on over search for biology in the
box<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> choice<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
box you can see that we get a choice of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.450 
box you can see that we get a choice of
all<00:01:43.799> these<00:01:43.950> sites<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.759> these<00:01:45.180> question<00:01:45.570> sets

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
all these sites all these question sets

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.380 
all these sites all these question sets
play<00:01:47.460> by<00:01:47.640> sure<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:47.939> lets<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.240> create

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
play by sure actually lets you create

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
play by sure actually lets you create
your<00:01:48.600> own<00:01:48.630> questions<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> can't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
your own questions that if you can't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
your own questions that if you can't
find<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.149> from<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> these

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
find a really good one from one of these

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
find a really good one from one of these
as<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.299> blood

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
as well but for now I think blood

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.300 
as well but for now I think blood
vessels<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> heart<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.890> fine

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.920 

so<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.850> last<00:02:00.149> step<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.659> we're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so very last step is we're going to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
so very last step is we're going to
assign<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.290> students<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.159> missions

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
assign some students to this missions

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.719 
assign some students to this missions
let's<00:02:03.360> assign<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> Amy<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.829> Ben<00:02:05.189> but

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
let's assign it to Amy and Ben but

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
let's assign it to Amy and Ben but
perhaps<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> Christine<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:10.370> that's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
perhaps not to Christine and that's

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.110 
perhaps not to Christine and that's
essentially<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
essentially it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.800 
essentially it
why

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
why

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.280 
why
out<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.380> Mission<00:02:13.650> Control<00:02:13.860> Center<00:02:13.980> and
