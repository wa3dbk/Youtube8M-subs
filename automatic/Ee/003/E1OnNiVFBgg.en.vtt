water you run it under the sink for two
seconds<00:00:47.070> boom<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.700> done<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> both

now<00:00:51.899> store<00:00:52.710> those<00:00:52.890> gloves<00:00:53.160> together<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
now store those gloves together so it's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670 
now store those gloves together so it's
only<00:00:54.120> temporary<00:00:54.420> sewing<00:00:54.930> together<00:00:55.079> while<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
only temporary sewing together while you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.250 
only temporary sewing together while you
allow<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> moisture<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:57.390> absorb<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> evoke<00:00:58.110> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
allow the moisture to absorb it evoke so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860 
allow the moisture to absorb it evoke so
wrap<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> tight<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.270> put<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.600> glove

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
wrap it tight you put them in your glove

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
wrap it tight you put them in your glove
back<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> surface<00:01:02.460> water<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
back so take that surface water on the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
back so take that surface water on the
gloves<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.629> gets<00:01:03.870> into<00:01:04.289> the<00:01:04.410> pores<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
gloves and it gets into the pores of the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
gloves and it gets into the pores of the
latex<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> super<00:01:07.500> soft<00:01:07.770> latex

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
latex because this is a super soft latex

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
latex because this is a super soft latex
or<00:01:08.520> above<00:01:08.789> this<00:01:09.149> is<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> best<00:01:09.660> cells<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
or above this is the best cells has to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
or above this is the best cells has to
offer<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.950> total<00:01:11.280> contact<00:01:11.729> exosphere<00:01:12.570> all

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
offer the total contact exosphere all

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.560 
offer the total contact exosphere all
right<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.729> better<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
right it's going to be better when it is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.679 
right it's going to be better when it is
damp<00:01:15.869> okay<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> I've<00:01:18.030> done<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
damp okay so now that I've done this I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
damp okay so now that I've done this I
get<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> practice<00:01:19.770> field<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> game

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
get to the practice field or the game

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
get to the practice field or the game
and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.030> start<00:01:21.270> warming<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.659> maybe<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and I start warming up maybe I need a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
and I start warming up maybe I need a
little<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:22.950> more<00:01:23.189> moisture<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:23.970> add<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
little bit more moisture so you add a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
little bit more moisture so you add a
little<00:01:24.600> bit<00:01:24.689> more<00:01:24.900> water<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.740> maybe

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
little bit more water and then maybe

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
little bit more water and then maybe
take<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> off<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.560> right

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
take it off if it's too much all right

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
take it off if it's too much all right
so<00:01:28.860> again<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.369> want<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> sponge<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so again you don't want the sponge you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530 
so again you don't want the sponge you
want<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.380> enough<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.729> latex<00:01:33.180> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
want just enough water on that latex it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.330 
want just enough water on that latex it
is<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.840> ripped<00:01:34.110> rip<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.070> want<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
is not ripped rip in there you want it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
is not ripped rip in there you want it
so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> increases<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> grip<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> durability

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so it increases the grip and durability

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.440 
so it increases the grip and durability
if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:38.070> feel<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> need<00:01:38.579> more<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.240> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
if you feel you can need more you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
if you feel you can need more you can
add<00:01:39.630> more<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> drink<00:01:40.890> during<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
add more when you take a drink during a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
add more when you take a drink during a
game<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.390> some<00:01:42.720> bowl<00:01:42.930> keepers<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
game I know some bowl keepers have a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.140 
game I know some bowl keepers have a
spray<00:01:43.829> bottle<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.430> great<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.970> see

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
spray bottle and that's great and I see

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.090 
spray bottle and that's great and I see
youtube<00:01:45.659> videos<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.170> spray<00:01:46.439> bottles<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
youtube videos with spray bottles but

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
youtube videos with spray bottles but
not<00:01:47.610> every<00:01:47.850> goalkeeper<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> spray<00:01:48.869> bottle

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
not every goalkeeper has a spray bottle

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
not every goalkeeper has a spray bottle
so<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> water<00:01:50.460> bottle<00:01:50.700> into<00:01:50.909> their

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
so they have a water bottle into their

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880 
so they have a water bottle into their
goal<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> spray<00:01:51.990> bottle<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> just

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
goal they have a spray bottle so I just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
goal they have a spray bottle so I just
say<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.759> regulate<00:01:54.060> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
say you know what you can regulate that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.910 
say you know what you can regulate that
moisture<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> spray<00:01:55.259> bottle<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.710> well

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920

moisture with a spray bottle as well
some<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.610> cubes<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> drink<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> water

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
some little cubes take a drink of water

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.300 
some little cubes take a drink of water
and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.110> spit<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.590> water<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.130> their

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
