00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
okay all needs yanmar in denmark lone

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay all needs yanmar in denmark lone
single<00:00:07.560> cylinder<00:00:07.800> engines<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.880> fuel<00:00:08.910> screw

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
single cylinder engines the fuel screw

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.320 
single cylinder engines the fuel screw
is<00:00:09.660> actually<00:00:10.460> really<00:00:11.460> simple<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.059> easy<00:00:12.090> to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
is actually really simple and easy to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.400 
is actually really simple and easy to
find<00:00:12.650> it's<00:00:13.650> right<00:00:13.800> here<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.420> all<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.690> does<00:00:15.840> is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
find it's right here and all it does is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.170 
find it's right here and all it does is
it<00:00:17.130> limits<00:00:18.170> when<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.349> this<00:00:19.950> is<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> throttle

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it limits when the this is the throttle

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.180 
it limits when the this is the throttle
linkage<00:00:21.300> basically<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
linkage basically right here this is the

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.340 
linkage basically right here this is the
shaft<00:00:23.610> that<00:00:24.240> goes<00:00:24.600> into<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> engine<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
shaft that goes into the engine and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.689 
shaft that goes into the engine and
connect<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.890> linkage<00:00:26.190> to<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> injection

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
connect to the linkage to the injection

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.390 
connect to the linkage to the injection
pump<00:00:26.970> right<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.590> trowels<00:00:28.590> down<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.190> it's<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
pump right here trowels down here it's a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.689 
pump right here trowels down here it's a
linkage<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> anyways<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.279> it'll<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.340> cruising

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
linkage and anyways so it'll be cruising

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.930 
linkage and anyways so it'll be cruising
like<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.330> at<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.250> governor<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.760> ever

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
like right here at the governor or ever

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
like right here at the governor or ever
you<00:00:36.330> have<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.540> throttle<00:00:36.720> set<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you have the throttle set and when the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
you have the throttle set and when the
engine<00:00:38.370> comes<00:00:38.700> under<00:00:38.940> load<00:00:39.120> it'll<00:00:39.510> try<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
engine comes under load it'll try and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.860 
engine comes under load it'll try and
compensate<00:00:40.460> by<00:00:41.460> adding<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.390> fuel<00:00:42.630> but

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
compensate by adding more fuel but

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.030 
compensate by adding more fuel but
pumping<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:43.890> more<00:00:44.070> fuel<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> pump<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
pumping out more fuel so the pump will

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.190 
pumping out more fuel so the pump will
go<00:00:47.040> this<00:00:47.550> way<00:00:47.610> until<00:00:48.540> it<00:00:48.630> hits<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> governor

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
go this way until it hits the governor

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.780 
go this way until it hits the governor
it<00:00:49.590> did<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.980> kill<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> hip<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> governor

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
it did not kill the hip the governor

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.319 
it did not kill the hip the governor
until<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.120> hits<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:53.160> screw<00:00:54.120> here

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
until it hits the this this screw here

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
until it hits the this this screw here
in<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:55.200> case<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> can't<00:00:55.739> feel<00:00:55.980> any<00:00:56.219> harder<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
in which case I can't feel any harder it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
in which case I can't feel any harder it
slots<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> maximum<00:00:57.570> feeling<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.260> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
slots the maximum feeling you can that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
slots the maximum feeling you can that's
just<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.980> basically<00:00:59.250> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.329> maximum

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
just so basically this is the maximum

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.439 
just so basically this is the maximum
fuel<00:01:00.989> screw<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.620> cannot<00:01:01.920> after<00:01:02.910> hits<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.300> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
fuel screw it cannot after hits here it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.510 
fuel screw it cannot after hits here it
can't<00:01:03.660> feel<00:01:03.840> any<00:01:04.110> harder<00:01:04.440> if<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.190> scared<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
can't feel any harder if you scared it

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.010 
can't feel any harder if you scared it
out<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.119> screw<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.720> certain

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
out you can screw it up to a certain

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.809 
out you can screw it up to a certain
point<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.500> otherwise<00:01:07.830> until<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> shaft

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
point because otherwise until the shaft

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.850 
point because otherwise until the shaft
the<00:01:09.479> shaft<00:01:09.509> won't<00:01:09.990> come<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.319> here<00:01:10.560> anymore

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the shaft won't come out here anymore

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
the shaft won't come out here anymore
but<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.550> can<00:01:11.580> screw<00:01:11.910> it<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.179> until<00:01:12.450> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
but you can screw it up until it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.029 
but you can screw it up until it's
maximum<00:01:12.929> point<00:01:13.259> in<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.500> case<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
maximum point in which case when the

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.090 
maximum point in which case when the
energy<00:01:14.220> comes<00:01:14.399> under<00:01:14.640> load<00:01:14.819> it<00:01:15.690> will<00:01:16.289> fuel<00:01:16.770> as

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
energy comes under load it will fuel as

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.029 
energy comes under load it will fuel as
hard<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> which<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.539> but<00:01:19.050> you

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
hard as they can which would but you

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.309 
hard as they can which would but you
don't<00:01:20.429> really<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.789> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.179> it<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.780> don't

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
don't really want to do it you don't

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.749 
don't really want to do it you don't
want<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> set<00:01:22.709> the<00:01:22.800> field<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> maximum<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
want to set the field to maximum because

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.150 
want to set the field to maximum because
these<00:01:24.720> naturally<00:01:25.200> aspirated<00:01:25.500> engines<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
these naturally aspirated engines you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.740 
these naturally aspirated engines you
only<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.550> as<00:01:26.670> much<00:01:26.819> fuel<00:01:27.030> else<00:01:27.209> can<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> burned

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
only put as much fuel else can be burned

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.290 
only put as much fuel else can be burned
maybe<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> little<00:01:28.709> bit<00:01:28.830> more<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
maybe a little bit more to get that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.230 
maybe a little bit more to get that
maximum<00:01:30.630> fuel<00:01:31.080> output<00:01:31.709> only<00:01:32.550> case<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> would

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
maximum fuel output only case you would

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.820 
maximum fuel output only case you would
want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> turn<00:01:33.539> it<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.840> fuel<00:01:34.110> end<00:01:34.289> up<00:01:34.470> anymore

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
want to turn it the fuel end up anymore

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.279 
want to turn it the fuel end up anymore
on<00:01:35.069> these<00:01:35.190> engines<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.209> you<00:01:36.330> had<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> turbo

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
on these engines is if you had a turbo

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.770 
on these engines is if you had a turbo
charge<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:38.670> recharge<00:01:38.910> your<00:01:39.090> application<00:01:39.569> do

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
charge to recharge your application do

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
charge to recharge your application do
it<00:01:40.250> because<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> bed<00:01:41.849> could<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.179> use

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it because the bed could actually use

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.139 
it because the bed could actually use
the<00:01:42.660> peel<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.220> turn<00:01:44.459> it<00:01:44.550> into<00:01:44.640> power<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the peel and turn it into power but

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.639 
the peel and turn it into power but
otherwise<00:01:46.080> it's<00:01:46.410> just<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.830> out<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
otherwise it's just going out and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
otherwise it's just going out and
turning<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.739> your<00:01:49.890> EG<00:01:50.130> teas<00:01:50.810> cut<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:51.929> engine

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
turning up your EG teas cut an engine

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.030 
turning up your EG teas cut an engine
life<00:01:52.729> no<00:01:53.729> no<00:01:54.599> specific<00:01:55.020> reason

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.200 

so<00:01:58.640> yeah<00:01:58.820> its<00:01:59.230> overview<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:01.490> is<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.150> is

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
so yeah its overview this is the this is

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.040 
so yeah its overview this is the this is
a<00:02:02.330> fuel<00:02:02.690> linkage<00:02:03.290> assembly<00:02:03.410> this<00:02:03.860> this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
a fuel linkage assembly this this

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.210 
a fuel linkage assembly this this
chapter<00:02:06.050> here<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:06.470> connects<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.920> linkage

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
chapter here it's connects to linkage

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.370 
chapter here it's connects to linkage
the<00:02:07.370> injector<00:02:07.790> poke<00:02:07.940> directly<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.990> goes<00:02:09.200> down

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
the injector poke directly it goes down

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.160 
the injector poke directly it goes down
here<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.120> that<00:02:11.120> goes<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.050> all

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
here and that goes it's in this is all

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.960 
here and that goes it's in this is all
in<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.440> engine<00:02:12.710> from<00:02:13.160> back<00:02:13.340> up<00:02:13.640> until<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
in the engine from back up until the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.060 
in the engine from back up until the
shaft<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.450> shaft<00:02:14.480> comes<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:15.980> it's

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
shaft and the shaft comes and then it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.800 
shaft and the shaft comes and then it's
connected<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.210> throttle<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:19.810> because

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
connected to the throttle and because

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.270 
connected to the throttle and because
this<00:02:20.960> shaft<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.440> connected<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
this shaft is connected to the to a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
wouldn't try to I'm sure there's a way

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.570 
wouldn't try to I'm sure there's a way
to<00:02:56.780> adjust<00:02:59.500> governor<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.560> don't<00:03:01.190> know<00:03:01.280> if<00:03:01.370> there

to adjust governor I don't know if there

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.240 
to adjust governor I don't know if there
is<00:03:01.700> or<00:03:01.850> not<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.260> even<00:03:03.260> if<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.470> could<00:03:03.709> if<00:03:04.070> you

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
is or not but even if you could if you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.090 
is or not but even if you could if you
can<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.959> wouldn't<00:03:05.959> because<00:03:07.239> these<00:03:08.239> engines<00:03:08.690> are

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
can I wouldn't because these engines are

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.300 
can I wouldn't because these engines are
Chinese<00:03:10.100> made<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.870> don't<00:03:11.870> know<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.310> their

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
little diesels and I would not drive

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.720 
little diesels and I would not drive
them<00:03:16.610> past<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.930> 3600<00:03:18.620> limit<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.580> would

them past the 3600 limit I would

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.060 
them past the 3600 limit I would
actually<00:03:20.170> continuous<00:03:21.170> rpm<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.860> for<00:03:21.980> the

yanmar out I would personally recommend

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.080 
yanmar out I would personally recommend
no<00:03:25.489> more<00:03:25.519> than<00:03:25.760> 30<00:03:26.660> 30<00:03:27.110> q<00:03:27.350> 3400<00:03:28.160> continuous<00:03:28.970> I

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
wouldn't keep it at 3600 rpm continuous

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.310 
wouldn't keep it at 3600 rpm continuous
I'm<00:03:31.760> sure<00:03:31.910> it'll<00:03:32.060> last<00:03:32.239> but<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.780> won't<00:03:33.170> last

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I'm sure it'll last but it won't last

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.460 
I'm sure it'll last but it won't last

get<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.510> turbocharger<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.139> mount<00:04:06.440> a

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
get a turbocharger and mount a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.350 
get a turbocharger and mount a
motorcycle<00:04:07.070> transmission<00:04:07.579> to<00:04:07.700> it

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
motorcycle transmission to it

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690 
motorcycle transmission to it
because<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.410> is<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.560> tape<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.220> tapered

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
because this is a tape of a tapered

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.340 
because this is a tape of a tapered
shaft<00:04:10.910> like<00:04:11.270> just<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> beginning<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:12.290> I

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
shaft like just at the beginning so I

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.700 
shaft like just at the beginning so I
was<00:04:12.440> going<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> get<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:13.720> pulley<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:15.020> can<00:04:15.230> you

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
was going to get a pulley that can you

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.410 
was going to get a pulley that can you
can<00:04:15.830> put<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> screw<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.370> clamps<00:04:16.940> down<00:04:17.000> on<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
can put a screw it clamps down on the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.509 
can put a screw it clamps down on the
shaft<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.959> then<00:04:18.860> it's<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.340> run

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
shaft and then it's just going to run

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.009 
shaft and then it's just going to run
and<00:04:19.760> then<00:04:20.150> I'm<00:04:20.209> going<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.360> take<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.570> motorbike

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
and then I'm going to take a motorbike

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.410 
and then I'm going to take a motorbike
case<00:04:21.440> cut<00:04:22.160> off<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> piston<00:04:22.730> in<00:04:22.850> Arad<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.270> I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
case cut off the piston in Arad and I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.630 
case cut off the piston in Arad and I
know<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.750> crank<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.230> on<00:04:24.440> balance<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.010> I've

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
know the crank it's on balance but I've

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.220 
know the crank it's on balance but I've
seen<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:25.910> done<00:04:26.090> before<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.690> doesn't<00:04:26.960> throw

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
seen it done before and it doesn't throw

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.410 
seen it done before and it doesn't throw
it<00:04:27.290> off<00:04:27.440> as<00:04:27.620> much<00:04:27.770> as<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.040> think<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.550> then

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
it off as much as you think and then

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.690 
it off as much as you think and then
basically<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.170> you<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.860> full<00:04:31.160> pot

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
basically you just you have a full pot

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.030 
basically you just you have a full pot
speed<00:04:32.140> five<00:04:33.140> gears<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:35.000> run<00:04:35.800> whatever<00:04:36.800> you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
speed five gears to run whatever you

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.280 
speed five gears to run whatever you
want<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.340> I'm<00:04:37.460> thinking<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.970> either<00:04:38.290> more

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
want and I'm thinking of either more

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.250 
want and I'm thinking of either more
bike<00:04:39.500> or<00:04:39.740> go-kart<00:04:40.220> applications<00:04:41.110> which<00:04:42.110> would

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
bike or go-kart applications which would

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.190 
bike or go-kart applications which would
be<00:04:43.060> something<00:04:44.060> neat<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.510> interesting<00:04:44.600> and

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
be something neat and interesting and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.370 
be something neat and interesting and
with<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.470> turbocharger<00:04:46.750> I'm<00:04:47.750> sure<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.200> could

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
with the turbocharger I'm sure you could

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.660 
with the turbocharger I'm sure you could
probably<00:04:48.410> run<00:04:48.920> around<00:04:49.750> 10<00:04:50.750> psi<00:04:51.200> boost<00:04:51.670> these

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
probably run around 10 psi boost these

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.610 
probably run around 10 psi boost these
heads<00:04:52.970> already<00:04:53.690> they<00:04:53.870> come<00:04:54.080> with<00:04:54.230> studs<00:04:54.500> so

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
heads already they come with studs so

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.620 
heads already they come with studs so
not<00:04:57.620> terrible<00:04:58.040> quality<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:58.760> it's<00:04:59.390> not<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
not terrible quality but it's not the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.870 
not terrible quality but it's not the
greatest<00:04:59.840> either<00:05:00.200> so<00:05:00.410> I<00:05:00.710> don't<00:05:01.280> know<00:05:01.490> that's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
greatest either so I don't know that's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.840 
greatest either so I don't know that's
the<00:05:02.060> one<00:05:02.180> thing<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.420> would<00:05:02.480> be<00:05:02.720> willing<00:05:02.900> to

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
the one thing I would be willing to

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.140 
the one thing I would be willing to
experiment

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
experiment

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.470 
experiment
push<00:05:05.810> push<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.410> engine<00:05:06.710> on<00:05:06.860> as<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.270> fuel<00:05:08.270> on<00:05:08.390> as

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
push push the engine on as a fuel on as

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.610 
push push the engine on as a fuel on as
hard<00:05:08.600> as<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:08.780> can<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.170> give<00:05:09.320> it<00:05:09.410> as<00:05:09.470> much

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
hard as you can and give it as much

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.950 
hard as you can and give it as much
juice<00:05:09.800> as<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:10.040> can<00:05:10.250> because<00:05:11.090> I'm<00:05:11.450> sure<00:05:11.720> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
juice as you can because I'm sure the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.360 
juice as you can because I'm sure the
first<00:05:12.200> thing<00:05:12.380> that<00:05:12.590> will<00:05:12.710> go<00:05:12.919> it's<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.220> head

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
first thing that will go it's a head

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.010 
first thing that will go it's a head
gasket<00:05:13.550> which<00:05:14.000> isn't<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.419> hard<00:05:14.540> to<00:05:14.810> replace

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
gasket which isn't that hard to replace

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.930 
gasket which isn't that hard to replace
on<00:05:16.010> these<00:05:16.190> engines<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:17.570> yeah
