classical<00:00:20.320> music<00:00:20.500> is<00:00:20.710> probably<00:00:21.010> more

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
classical music is probably more

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.400 
classical music is probably more
important<00:00:22.000> now<00:00:22.180> than<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.600> used<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.990> be<00:00:23.170> but

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
important now than it used to be but

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.760 
important now than it used to be but
unfortunately<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.619> can<00:00:26.920> see<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.369> many

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
unfortunately I can see that many

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.499 
unfortunately I can see that many
classical<00:00:29.770> musicians<00:00:30.279> don't<00:00:30.460> realize<00:00:30.910> their

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
classical musicians don't realize their

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.759 
classical musicians don't realize their
their<00:00:31.930> role<00:00:32.169> they<00:00:32.890> just<00:00:33.220> enjoy<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:35.500> just

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
their role they just enjoy they just

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:43.950 
their role they just enjoy they just
enjoy<00:00:36.100> being<00:00:36.460> within<00:00:36.790> their<00:00:37.150> art<00:00:37.390> but<00:00:42.960> there

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
enjoy being within their art but there

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.229 
enjoy being within their art but there
is<00:00:44.110> also<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.530> certain<00:00:45.930> mission<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:49.030> one

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
is also a certain mission which one

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:58.709 
is also a certain mission which one
should<00:00:49.420> forget<00:00:49.780> about

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.290 

I<00:00:59.190> think<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.489> completion<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.120> a

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
I think that one is completion is a

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.259 
I think that one is completion is a
little<00:01:01.539> bit<00:01:01.629> different<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:03.399> looked<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:04.059> little

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
little bit different it looked a little

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.780 
little bit different it looked a little
bit<00:01:04.509> more<00:01:04.960> friendly<00:01:05.290> than<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.610> other

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
bit more friendly than the other

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.170 
bit more friendly than the other
competitions<00:01:07.509> and<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:08.650> thought<00:01:08.979> maybe<00:01:09.220> it's<00:01:09.909> my

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
competitions and I thought maybe it's my

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.289 
competitions and I thought maybe it's my
chance<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.070> that's<00:01:12.310> why<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> decided<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.180> take

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
chance so that's why I decided to take

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.389 
chance so that's why I decided to take
part<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.869> just<00:01:14.080> like<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.650> philosophy<00:01:15.250> behind

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
part I just like the philosophy behind

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:34.830 
part I just like the philosophy behind
the<00:01:15.670> competition<00:01:33.330> developing<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.600> as

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
the competition developing this and as

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.100 
the competition developing this and as
an<00:01:34.990> artist<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.090> difficult<00:01:37.720> thing<00:01:37.750> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
an artist is is a difficult thing and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.270 
an artist is is a difficult thing and
nobody<00:01:39.069> knows<00:01:39.399> how<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.670> do<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.530> adore

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
nobody knows how to do this but I adore

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.130 
nobody knows how to do this but I adore
travelling<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.000> that's<00:01:43.210> why<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> professional

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
travelling and that's why a professional

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.559 
travelling and that's why a professional
musician<00:01:44.440> is<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:45.009> right<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.880> right<00:01:46.030> profession

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
musician is a right the right profession

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.200 
musician is a right the right profession
for<00:01:46.720> me

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.150 

I<00:01:51.280> have<00:01:52.280> lots<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.700> different<00:01:53.660> dreams<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:55.010> is

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
I have lots of different dreams what is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.400 
I have lots of different dreams what is
particularly<00:01:56.150> interesting<00:01:56.420> for<00:01:57.050> me<00:01:57.200> is

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
particularly interesting for me is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.050 
particularly interesting for me is
playing<00:01:58.900> Beethoven<00:01:59.900> number<00:02:00.230> five<00:02:00.440> at<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
playing Beethoven number five at the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.360 
playing Beethoven number five at the
Piazza<00:02:02.060> San<00:02:02.090> Marco<00:02:02.270> in<00:02:02.600> Venice<00:02:03.250> because<00:02:04.250> I

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
Piazza San Marco in Venice because I

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.969 
Piazza San Marco in Venice because I
think<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.880> combination<00:02:05.810> will<00:02:06.020> give<00:02:06.050> some

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
think this combination will give some

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.350 
think this combination will give some
very<00:02:07.400> very<00:02:08.270> special<00:02:08.750> feeling<00:02:09.080> and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.870 

there<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.020> lots<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> another<00:02:13.590> things<00:02:13.950> of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
there are lots of another things of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960 
there are lots of another things of
putting<00:02:15.330> putting<00:02:15.660> music<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.410> some<00:02:16.970> very

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
putting putting music in some very

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
putting putting music in some very
special<00:02:18.390> circumstances<00:02:19.170> which<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:20.190> bring

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
special circumstances which will bring

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.180 
special circumstances which will bring
out<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> beauty<00:02:21.750> most<00:02:21.930> both<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> place

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
out the beauty most both of the place

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
out the beauty most both of the place
and<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.630> music<00:02:24.930> itself<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:29.630> think<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and of the music itself I think the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.600 
and of the music itself I think the
world<00:02:31.110> needs<00:02:31.700> comforting<00:02:32.990> now<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:35.460> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
world needs comforting now and this is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.550 
world needs comforting now and this is
what<00:02:35.900> their<00:02:36.900> art<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.670> supply<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.210> then<00:02:39.960> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
what their art can supply and then there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.420 
what their art can supply and then there
is<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.710> need<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:42.500> great<00:02:43.500> need<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.710> waking<00:02:44.250> up

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
is a need of a great need of waking up

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 
is a need of a great need of waking up
also<00:02:44.720> yes<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> probably<00:02:46.530> even

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
also yes and this is probably even

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.470 
also yes and this is probably even
harder<00:02:47.370> than<00:02:47.790> comforting<00:02:48.590> because<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:50.480> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
harder than comforting because it's it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.840 
harder than comforting because it's it
can<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.930> painful<00:02:52.350> for<00:02:52.800> people<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.490> wake<00:02:53.610> up

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
can be painful for people to wake up

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.110 
can be painful for people to wake up
sometimes<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.310> painful<00:02:56.490> for<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
sometimes and it can be painful for the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.290 
sometimes and it can be painful for the
artist<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.660> make<00:02:57.750> them<00:02:58.080> break<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:59.280> it's<00:03:02.300> it

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
artist to make them break up but it's it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.150 
artist to make them break up but it's it
depends<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> artist<00:03:03.900> feel<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.620> he<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:05.130> he

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
depends on the artist feel if he if he

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.670 
depends on the artist feel if he if he
wants<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:06.000> her<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.570> wrong<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.170> he<00:03:07.350> if

wants to have her this wrong and he if

wants to have her this wrong and he if
he<00:03:07.890> feels<00:03:08.130> his<00:03:08.370> mission<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.110> think<00:03:10.310> there<00:03:11.310> are
