00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.170
 Welcome to a canal rai 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.790
 First of all, I want to go for it 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 excuse that is so long on it 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.170
 that uploaded a new video 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.900
 unfortunately I had a bit much 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.119
 to do and maybe it is already 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.650
 noticed that I design a channel 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.050
 that also has a lot of time 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.910
 tasted or like to know what you got from it 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.010
 Hold me would be happy if you more 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.039
 to write about it as her hero main 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.410
 and then I want to be 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.449
 be that at instagram already that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.800
 is meant also not noticed 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.289
 I would be glad if you me 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.690
 Of course you would follow that as well 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:42.049
 always noticed what I do and so 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.059
 what am I so days and then I come 

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.359
 the actual topic and indeed one 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.459
 house and there I want to ask you 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.289
 what do you think about the wood? 

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:53.600
 do you want to see something like that, or he wanted to 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.659
 honest look would also be happy 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.219
 millimeters of feedback would give though 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.319
 Today I make another horn so how 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.939
 a little kid ordered on the internet 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:12.200
 fights called cosmetics and now 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:13.689
 I grab this and I have it 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.369
 ordered me 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:22.159
 from siegmar noticed too much 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.659
 many things from mac yes what's up 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.909
 want to say anything with 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.850
 Of course I knew somehow 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.950
 not yet a time for that though 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.899
 What I can think of now that I am 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 use many brands of products as well 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.539
 are very expensive for example mac and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.899
 other things if your look sees itself 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.549
 introduce in wolfsthal use products 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.140
 I want to tell you that you are 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.220
 Do not buy these expensive products 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.260
 because I know how expensive it is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 It 's pretty much on the money you can 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.040
 you always buy alternative I think 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.570
 for example with dm or rossmann colors 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.690
 For example, I do not do that often 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.050
 use blue shades eg for a party 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.540
 Mecca or green so dark green things 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.929
 then just bought me an alternative 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.220
 things at dm and rossmann but so Beck 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.170
 For example, have brown bright pink tones like that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.520
 natural tones and especially max last 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 safety a bit and encapsulate with 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 lingering away and so maybe one 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 Tip for you so you can do that too 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 maybe that does not set you down 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.820
 print 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 to have to buy all the things 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.580
 So I always look for alternatives 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.230
 make it too bad that he continues ok 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.720
 Now it goes on to my case there 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.290
 I start already with the first such 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:48.810
 Sigma said I have a rap 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:03:05.459
 and kabuki make-up island yes but not 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:11.970
 very much looking forward to it is the fourteenth 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:18.960
 and then I have 16 21 here 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:23.340
 a small brush yes so yes I have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.650
 i mean sonora a brush and now 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.020
 I want this with a pc needs 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.480
 I still buy such a small color 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.810
 if I'm very curious how I use it 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.780
 can handle 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.450
 I certainly just have to practice that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.330
 Here I come to the next one 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:44.520
 and what is a prestige since enke im 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:50.580
 pay day that one is actually with 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.560
 this one is very big and the one 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.490
 smaller 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 I'll take a while for my concept 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.470
 concealer brack damaging the take 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.890
 I prefer for the base for the eye and 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:09.080
 I want to try it now 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:22.440
 then I have such a blender in the here 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:24.720
 zgb when writing no course 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:35.940
 I'm curious how insulation is then 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:39.210
 I still got bigger, I think so 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.860
 interest bigger so from the bristles 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:49.590
 Longer a bit longer 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:52.169
 Thicker than the leisure mobile that is 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.740
 my pictures I ordered from it 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.000
 you look very excited that they are 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.830
 It did not have to be more 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.320
 I hope that you can 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.390
 has fallen as it says at the beginning 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.639
 I would be interested if it is you 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.009
 Interested 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.749
 that I bought so unicorn 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.789
 I would like to know that 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.310
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.499
 do not forget to guess my video 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.120
 it will or not and maybe off and on 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.650
 to even main channel and I am pleased 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.650
