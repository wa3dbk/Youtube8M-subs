HTC sense now you could have as many
pages<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> guys<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
have all these pages and there's no

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
have all these pages and there's no
launch<00:00:40.680> icon<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.969> set<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> lot

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
launch icon and I like this set up a lot

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.729 
launch icon and I like this set up a lot
more<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> launcher<00:00:43.559> there's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
more so when you have a launcher there's

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.770 
more so when you have a launcher there's
just<00:00:43.890> tons<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.640> apps<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.210> page<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just tons of apps in one page and it's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
just tons of apps in one page and it's
really<00:00:46.020> hard<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> find<00:00:46.500> stuff<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
really hard to find stuff this way I can

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
really hard to find stuff this way I can
organize<00:00:48.180> stuff<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.719> games<00:00:49.020> my

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
organize stuff with my games my

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
organize stuff with my games my
productivity<00:00:49.710> apps<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> lot<00:00:51.030> easier

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
productivity apps and it's a lot easier

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
productivity apps and it's a lot easier
for<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.899> actually<00:00:52.500> kind<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
for me and actually kind of like the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
for me and actually kind of like the
iPhone<00:00:53.370> iPod<00:00:53.699> Touch<00:00:53.760> Heather's<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.239> pages

and you don't have to have the launcher
which<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.480> some<00:00:58.230> of
