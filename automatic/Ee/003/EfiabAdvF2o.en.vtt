00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 the national museum of colombia presents the exhibition felisa boxing a praise 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 the scrap this Bogota sculptor of Jewish descent during her more than 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.510
 50 years of artistic life managed to produce more than sixty sculptures 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.410
 made with metal waste you share sculptures that we can 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 observe in this exhibition 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.939
 It was a woman 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.050
 exceptional his work is premonitory of his work is truly avant-garde 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.109
 at the time it precedes many things that he says they did later 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.719
 he made a silence bogota instead of jorge polish jewish 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.880
 escaped from the Second World War 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.800
 from a very young age despite the conservative education he received 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.180
 elisa of judges and had as an artist facing society and all 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 boys 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.490
 for the sixties Augustine to have managed to revolutionize the way of doing 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.470
 sculpture in colombo left aside the traditional materials I hope to continue 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.120
 marble and went on to make works releasing pieces of scrap 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.620
 practice what he has learned in the face and mexico 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.740
 from Paris 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.969
 but when the country arrives it realizes that here they will not find 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.610
 you would knit technologies you need to be cast 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.650
 and of course you look at the tournament press junk 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.700
 then he starts working that from the 60's with a lot of humor 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.470
 with criticism with irony in a country as conservative as this one because many of 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.280
 his works were 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.010
 very controversial 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.360
 a work is important that to the extent that it does react to salary 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.600
 he replied happily in an interview where he was asked about the injuries 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.249
 houses 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.729
 leaving scrap aside to take forms remained 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.670
 I'm tired cathedral and the sculptural 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 one of them is the appointment over one thousand 174 costs a show totally 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.140
 he has future debate orio because they had allusions to sexuality and the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.390
 space of the intimate then good interested to rescue all that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.599
 also their contributions of their debates 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.319
 of it 40 years ago but that are still fully in force 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.950
 the work is ready for its not only revolutionized by leaving the parameters 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.400
 Traditional 3 future 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.390
 also by turning them into mind with vibrations leaving behind the rigid 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.469
 bros 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.929
 I do not understand much of 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.849
 e get this guy out 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.019
 in work but I do not like there are things that I like 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:36.370
 happy of course the critics reject poverty the living 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 but what I can not stand flexible colombia 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800
 it is necessary to exclude during the government of tucumÃ¡n accusation of conspiring against the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.439
 state 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.889
 died of a heart attack in a Parisian cafe with your friends dobre tercia 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.009
