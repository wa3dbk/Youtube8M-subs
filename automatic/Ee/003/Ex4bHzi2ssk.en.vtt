00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.770
 the first of December 2012 the 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.090
 American Psychiatric Association 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.070
 officially approved the last 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.349
 diagnostic criteria for the fifth 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 edition of your diagnostic manual and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.619
 statistic of mental disorders the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.929
 dsm 5 the manual is considered as the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 bible of psychiatry and the present 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 revision that is the first in 20 years 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.390
 It was compiled by more than 1500 experts 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.579
 in psychiatry psychology social work 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 pediatrics neurology and other disciplines 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 from about 40 countries 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 different the publication is expected to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.149
 May 2013 but you already know several 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.129
 important changes with respect to 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.949
 previous decisions that have called the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.449
 attention of the public due to 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.850
 that these have to do with disorders 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 well known to the general population and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.059
 that could affect patients and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 families on topics such as 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.440
 coverage of health plans of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.300
 insurers for example 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.370
 one of the changes that has received the most 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.740
 media attention is the elimination 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.560
 Asperger syndrome as a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
 official diagnosis instead will be 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.960
 included within one more definition 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 wide autistic spectrum disorder 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 Of course, this decision has brought 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.230
 some controversy especially on the part 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.480
 of professionals who have dedicated good 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.730
 part of his life to study and treat 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.380
 this condition as well as to patients and 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.660
 families who think they could 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 stop getting the treatments 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.710
 financings and services that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.900
 require but there are also recognized 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.060
 aspis as they are known to whom 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.120
 they suffer from this condition that they consider 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.070
 that it is a necessary adjustment 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.650
 among them is George Weston 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.140
 psychologist and author of the book racing 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.510
 marsans who recently wrote a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.800
 interesting column in the cardion where 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.440
 I noticed mixed feelings 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.090
 with respect to this decision but that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.920
 they finally took him to consider it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.040
 as appropriate 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 let's see part of his column 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.140
 when I first found out it makes a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.300
 couple of years ago of the proposal to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 remove the terms syndrome of 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.950
 Asperger and autism of the manual 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.940
 diagnosis and statistics of disorders 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.820
 mental illnesses and replace them by disorder 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.730
 of autistic spectrum I was against 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.770
 it people with asperger syndrome 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.340
 find the change as something very 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.190
 difficult and this was a big change and not 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.320
 desired to my identity however 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.470
 apart from being a spy 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.660
 I am also a psychologist and as such 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.360
 I felt that I needed to put my points of 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.370
 side personal view and investigate 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.700
 how we classify syndrome 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.700
 Asperger 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.069
 contrary to my views as well 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.989
 after reviewing the investigation I 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.260
 I have tried to conclude that in reality 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.590
 DSM 5 is a big step in the direction 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.569
 correct per year the studies have been 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.769
 suggesting that autism and the syndrome 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.060
 of asperger are the same condition 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.420
 differentiated only by the level of 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 disability is what I see in life 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.400
 everyday also my brother for example 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.010
 clearly has some form of autism 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.940
 but I could go into both diagnostics 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 in the same way therefore it seems to be 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.139
 a positive move now the question is 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.780
 what is this spectrum disorder 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.900
 autistic the new revision proposed by 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.069
 The American Psychiatric Association 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.720
 indicates that for an individual to be 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.940
 diagnosed with spectrum disorder 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.650
 autistic you must meet the following 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.500
 criteria 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.959
 deficits in social communication and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.079
 interaction that are not caused by 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.060
 General development delays should 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.890
 have the three areas of symptoms 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.650
 present 1 deficits in reciprocity 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.519
 emotional social fails to have a 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.629
 bidirectional conversation two deficits 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.459
 in non- verbal communication such as 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.730
 abnormal visual contact and language 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.459
 abnormal body or difficulty using 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.949
 and understand nonverbal communication and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.570
 a lack of facial expressions or 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.760
 gestures three deficits in creating and maintaining 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.550
 appropriate relationships for your level of 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.340
 development apart from relationships with 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.350
 who care for the individual this can 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.810
 include problems adjusting 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.960
 behavior to correspond to 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.729
 different social contexts 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.310
 difficulties with imaginative play and 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.330
 make friends and a lack of interest in 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.560
 other people 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.470
 see demonstration of restricted patterns 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.810
 and repetitive behavior 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.250
 interests or activities must present 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.250
 two of the following 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.860
 1 repetitive speech movements 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.110
 repetitive motors or repetitive use of 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.890
 Echolalia objects and phrases 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.470
 idiosyncratic 2 routine adherences 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.720
 ritualized patterns of behavior

 verbal or non-verbal or a strong 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.400
 resistance to change insists on eating 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.600
 the same food asks questions 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.569
 repetitive or feels great anguish 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.059
 small changes 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.119
 three obsessive interests that are 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:36.889
 abnormally intense with focused 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:41.179
 Strong attachment to unusual objects and

 Heat or cold pain or an answer 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:59.800

 read or touch extreme objects 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.779
 fascination with lights or objects that give 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.779
 turns

 the symptoms must be present in the

 early childhood may make us 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.010
 apparent until the social demand 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.440
 exceed the limited capacity of 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.740
 symptoms limit and hinder
