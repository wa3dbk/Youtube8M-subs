00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.729
 in the middle of the city away from the 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.050
 tall buildings and business towers 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.970
 the old downtown neighborhoods 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.950
 historic and zone 2 host 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.080
 religious monuments that move us 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.630
 to another time when going through the different 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.100
 Sanctuaries dating from the 18th and 19th century 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.490
 you can appreciate its value 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.960
 artistic and cultural architecture in 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.359
 where each one keeps stories 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.640
 important for the country Luis Fernando and 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.500
 your expert historian professor and 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.119
 art doctor share the following 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.860
 interview with the newspaper as a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.379
 from the transfer of santiago de 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.440
 guatemala to the hermitage valley today the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.230
 city of guatemala in 1776 after the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.730
 earthquake of santa marta in 1773 it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.469
 transformed the architecture of 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.079
 churches because they are the temples of 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.600
 transition 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.329
 what are those that still have 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.359
 Baroque reminiscences in expressions 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.839
 neoclassical made the new guatemala 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:02.440
 Nasturtium santa rosa and santo domingo already 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.539
 then come the neoclassical temples or 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.780
 the three great neoclassical codes of 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.520
 the new guatemala of the assumption and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.649
 these three great gems is that when 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.939
 look then when it is transformed 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.580
 transports to the old the no to 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.560
 guatemala there is a process like 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.240
 difficulty because there is no money for the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.369
 construction that's why you're 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.860
 Churches are chiquitas except the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.679
 holy sunday but it turns out that already when 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.229
 there is more money the government formally 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.509
 can support the inauguration of the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.959
 large three great neoclassical temples 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.649
 that are currently the jewelery we could 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:41.830
 say of the architecture of the 19th century in 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.750
 guatemala and these are going to be the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.890
 san francisco collection and the cathedral 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.289
 then these three great churches 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.690
 They have the characteristic of being 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.730
 Inspired by patterns 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.210
 order 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.510
 in patterns of classical order but in that 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.510
 mainly the collection and san 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.240
 francisco that present us facades 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.350
 made of English would already be where the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.660
 Corinthian columns of this cane 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.500
 while in the cathedral it is still 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.990
 assumes a neoclassical sense let's say 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 but with some presence with some 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.600
 Baroque presence because it is placed 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.080
 above the entrance portico or above 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.170
 from the main door a sculpture of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.470
 the apostle santiago as patron of the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.970
 archdiocese of guatemala already but in the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.590
 as long as no symbolism is placed 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.360
 it is understood that people can read it and 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.490
 if not a sculpture of santiago 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.700
 pilgrim then there is a reminiscence 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.030
 baroque of the idea 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.270
 for having the presence of the image 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.700
 patron of the place and sculpted where 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.590
 does tell directly allusion to his 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 paper not by means of symbols and not 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.180
 by a body sculpture 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 complete already then then you can 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.930
 consider that reminiscent of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.140
 order 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.500
 baroque and then there are other churches 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.409
 that have been inaugurated during the regime 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.180
 of career like the candelaria that is 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:22.359
 inaugurated in 1861 and 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.000
 but with neoclassical church patterns 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.620
 but what we look at now is 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.440
 a reconstruction 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.830
 let's say after the 1976 earthquake already 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:42.110
 what we see is a reconstruction of 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:45.170
 1976 not the original is like that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.290
 I was before as I was before because 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.200
 was inaugurated in 1926 and the other and 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.070
 destroyed in 1000 in 1976 but it was made 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.910
 new ones 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:05.000
 with reference photographs and 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:07.460
 like photographs and others the little hill of 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.980
 carmen if that is carmen territory is 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.980
 a strength that existed is a 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.920
 fortress against the devil 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.049
 but it's a classic church because as 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.440
 consequence of following up on a 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.140
 first stage of the conquest is a network 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.300
 is one is a prolongation true as well 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.520
 you have to put is an extension of the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.420
 first stage of the conquest in 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:36.370
 guatemala where these churches were 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.370
 strongholds against satan and
