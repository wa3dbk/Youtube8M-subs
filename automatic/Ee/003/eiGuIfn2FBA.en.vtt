00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the USB charger over here has an output

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.590 
the USB charger over here has an output
of<00:01:14.850> 2<00:01:15.920> amps<00:01:16.920> nowadays<00:01:17.729> phones<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.299> tablets

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of 2 amps nowadays phones and tablets

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
tablet to have a bigger charger with the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
tablet to have a bigger charger with the
bigger<00:01:26.850> output<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.659> who<00:01:27.900> knows<00:01:28.080> anyway<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
bigger output but who knows anyway this
