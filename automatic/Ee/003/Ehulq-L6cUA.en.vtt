00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.530 
into a player has burst fire weapons
tend<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.860> because<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.730> can't<00:02:46.940> spray<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
tend to do because you can't spray and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.339 
tend to do because you can't spray and
pray<00:02:47.569> all<00:02:47.750> over<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.319> place<00:02:49.720> 30<00:02:50.720> rounds<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.260> a

pray all over the place 30 rounds and a

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.080 
pray all over the place 30 rounds and a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
five enemies if you land free burst so

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.830 
five enemies if you land free burst so
six<00:02:56.390> shots<00:02:56.690> into<00:02:56.930> each<00:02:57.230> enemy<00:02:57.500> at<00:02:57.890> 75<00:02:58.579> meters

so I wouldn't recommend this weapon for

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.160 
so I wouldn't recommend this weapon for
the<00:03:01.640> sort<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:01.910> person<00:03:02.120> who<00:03:02.480> likes<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.930> breach

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
as for general tips my opinion is to use

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.260 
as for general tips my opinion is to use
first<00:04:24.000> during<00:04:24.530> medium-range<00:04:25.530> fights<00:04:25.949> and

semi-auto at range first fire range is

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.420 
semi-auto at range first fire range is
doable<00:04:30.180> but<00:04:30.659> it<00:04:30.900> is<00:04:31.199> quite<00:04:31.500> challenging<00:04:32.039> to
