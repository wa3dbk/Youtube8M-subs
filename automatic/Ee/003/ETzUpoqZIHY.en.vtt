00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:01.820
 In this video I want to explain 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.840
 what is parallax, and try 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.370
 to show what it is, 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.030
 as regards the observation of comparative 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.110
 close stars. 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.580
 In the next video we will think 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.840
 about how we can use it 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.360
 the parallax of nearby stars to 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.820
 we understand how far the distance to them is. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990
 The parallax is the visible change 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.380
 in the position of something depending on the different point of view. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.014
 That is, when you look out of a car, 

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.430
 you will see that depending on it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.434
 how far apart are things from you, 

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.600
 it would seem to be moving relative to each other. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.474
 I'm currently watching my computer screen. 

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.930
 If I move or shake my head, 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 the wall behind the monitor looks like it is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.905
 moves toward him. 

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.370
 It has happened to us all. 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.160
 But let's think about what 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.435
 is the parallax in the stars. 

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:56.670
 Let's Draw the Sun. 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.460
 Apparently nothing is on the right scale. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.150
 I will draw the Sun here, 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.160
 as well as the Earth at some point 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.039
 from its orbit around it. 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.580
 We will imagine that we are watching 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.800
 from somewhere above the Solar System. 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.480
 That is, the Earth will spin in that direction. 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.820
 Let's say the star that interests us is here. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 Again, it's obviously not the scale. 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.810
 What we will do is yes 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.380
 we wait for that moment of the year 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.910
 from our position in the orbit around the Sun - 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.145
 that is, at sunrise - and we are 

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:38.520
 here on the surface of the Earth. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.020
 For the sake of convenience, we assume that we are the Equator. 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 Let's say this star is somewhere 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.150
 on a plane with our solar system. 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.810
 We are at the Equator. 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 At sunrise, just when the first sunlight 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560
 begins to reach us - remember, now the Sun 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.440
 illuminates this side of the Earth - 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.210
 when the first rays reach us, 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 look straight up. 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.860
 That is, if you look straight up when you first 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.110
 rays come to me, and I look this way, 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.566
 my look will be in that direction. 

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.940
 Now let's imagine the direction in which 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.132
 look, is that one there. 

00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:26.590
 To be clear, this is a separate one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.890
 part of the diagram here. 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.170
 I'll sketch it here. 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 If the night sky looks like this, 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.500
 and the Sun has just begun to rise 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.300
 and looked straight up, looking in that direction. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.339
 Where will this star stand against her? 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.130
 It will be up right. 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.260
 The sun, as I drew it, is just to the left. 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.520
 Right up is now. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.390
 The sun is just on the horizon. 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.650
 The visible position of the star here 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.170
 upward direction 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.810
 will be at some angle to the left upwards. 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.640
 He will be here. 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.052
 The star obviously will not take that big 

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:17.260
 part of your vision, but you understand the principle. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.990
 I'll draw it a bit less, that's right. 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.100
 There will be some angle here. 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.060
 This angle, whatever it is, to it 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.210
 we call the theta, will be the same as this one. 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.710
 When I talk about a corner, I have 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.100
 given that if you measure on one side 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.480
 on the horizon to the other, 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.830
 you cross half the Earth. 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.470
 These are 180 degrees. 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.250
 That is, you can measure how much 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.830
 is this angle here. 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.530
 Let's say we wait six months. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.920
 What will happen? 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.304
 In six months we will be on this side of the sun. 

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.220
 We assume that our distance is comparative 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.940
 constantly and is an astronomical unit. 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.720
 Now what? 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.740
 He remembered that the Earth is spinning here. 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.280
 That is, if we wait until sunset, right 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480
 when the last trace of the Sun 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.060
 has disappeared - as you may think, now 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.602
 The sun brightens this part of the Earth. 

00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:19.060
 The sun will shine 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.018
 this side of the Earth. 

00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:23.460
 If we are right here on the equator when the sun 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.270
 it just sits down and we look straight up ... 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.920
 Let me do it in the same color. 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.180
 We look straight up. 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.230
 Six months later, when we look up, 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.080
 where is the star stopped our eyes? 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.847
 Well, she's right now. 

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:45.930
 It will be in that direction. 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.910
 That is, if this is our vision six months later, 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.320
 The sun sets to the right, 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.010
 on the right horizon. 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.220
 And if we look straight up, this star 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.840
 it will now be to the right of this right up. 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.490
 What happened? 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.910
 It looks as if facing upward - 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.330
 we observe from the same position on Earth. 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.310
 We chose dates in the year and time of the day, 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.970
 when "right up" is the same. 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.040
 We are observing the universe in one and the same direction. 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.810
 It looks as if that star has really moved. 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.197
 Let's say this is in the middle of the summer, 

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:38.780
 and this - the winter. 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.571
 It does not need to be. 

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.670
 They can be every two points six months apart. 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.050
 When we look at this star in the summer, 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.330
 it will be here. 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.080
 It's here in the summer. 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.871
 We look in the winter again 

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:51.062
 will be here. 

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:52.770
 In general, for each star, especially 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.520
 those who are on a plane with our Solar System, 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.100
 you can find two points a year, 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.910
 when the star is at maximum distance from the center. 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.810
 These are the two distances or the two times of the year, 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.060
 which will interest you most because 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.060
 it will be most interesting to measure this angle. 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.910
 I want it to be clear, this angle 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.890
 here is the same as here. 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.150
 You see that they are symmetrical. 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.830
 Whatever the corner, you can look at it from here. 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.800
 This is an isosceles triangle. 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.430
 Whatever the distance from here to here, 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.902
 and it will be from here to here. 

00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:36.110
 That is, and this angle will be equal to that angle, 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.360
 but that angle to the other. 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.010
 The next video I want 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.970
 to think about how we can measure 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.090
 exactly these two corners; or one of them, or both. 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.230
 Let it be clear if this corner in the night sky 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.460
 is theta, and this angle here is theta, 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.380
 the difference here is twice the theta. 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.350
 One way if you want to make sure, 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.890
 that your numbers are accurate enough, 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.700
 is simply to measure the overall difference 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.354
 around the center and split into two. 

00:07:03.354 --> 00:07:04.770
 But in the next video I want to 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.850
 to see how, if we can measure 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.890
 the visible change in the corner here, 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.896
 if we can find it, 

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:16.770
 how would we use this information, 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.469
 to find out how far the distance to that star is.
