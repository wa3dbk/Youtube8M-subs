it<00:02:09.629> from<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> beginning<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.310> way

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it from the beginning right the way

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.860 
it from the beginning right the way
through<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.209> see<00:02:12.420> how<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.629> work

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
through so that you can see how to work

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.430 
through so that you can see how to work
with

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
with
and<00:02:13.880> we'll<00:02:14.880> start<00:02:15.210> off<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> bit<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and we'll start off with a bit of a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.980 
and we'll start off with a bit of a
drawing<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:17.340> start<00:02:17.730> working<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.690> turns

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
drawing and then start working the turns

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.560 
drawing and then start working the turns
in<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:20.600> immediately<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:22.620> going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.570> have

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
in so immediately I'm going to just have

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.880 
in so immediately I'm going to just have
a<00:02:24.600> good<00:02:24.780> doing<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> face<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:28.620> course

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
a good doing the face and of course

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.520 
a good doing the face and of course
usually<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.280> bit<00:02:29.460> of<00:02:29.550> proportion<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:31.290> little

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
usually a bit of proportion and a little

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.620 
usually a bit of proportion and a little
bit<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.710> measuring<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.090> working<00:02:33.390> quite

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
bit of measuring and working quite

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.800 
bit of measuring and working quite
lightly<00:02:34.110> I'm<00:02:34.230> working<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> 6b<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.810> at

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
lightly I'm working with the 6b and at

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.930 
lightly I'm working with the 6b and at
this<00:02:36.990> stage<00:02:37.320> just<00:02:38.330> allocating<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.540> space<00:02:40.940> for

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
this stage just allocating the space for

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.030 
this stage just allocating the space for
this<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.270> animal<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.140> fit<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.620> making<00:02:44.010> sure

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this little animal to fit in making sure

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.690 
this little animal to fit in making sure
that<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.490> get<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.780> measurements<00:02:46.290> roughly<00:02:46.830> in

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that I get the measurements roughly in

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
that I get the measurements roughly in
line<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:49.770> get<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.070> proportions<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:51.260> like

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
line to get the proportions right like

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.620 
line to get the proportions right like
that<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:53.130> course<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.730> lovely<00:02:53.970> about<00:02:54.120> this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that of course what is lovely about this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.330 
that of course what is lovely about this
if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.930> make<00:02:55.110> any<00:02:55.320> mistakes<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.160> just

if you make any mistakes you can just

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.470 
if you make any mistakes you can just
lift<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.790> off<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.210> dab<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.930> off<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:59.180> or<00:03:00.180> cover

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
lift it off and dab it off and or cover

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.820 
lift it off and dab it off and or cover
it<00:03:00.630> up<00:03:00.750> with<00:03:00.810> more<00:03:01.200> tone<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:04.080> working<00:03:04.500> into<00:03:04.800> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
it up with more tone so working into the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.920 
it up with more tone so working into the
chest<00:03:05.340> area<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:09.210> can<00:03:09.360> imagine<00:03:09.540> being

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
chest area now and you can imagine being

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.690 
chest area now and you can imagine being
on<00:03:10.080> safari<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.800> sketching<00:03:11.340> away<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.520> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
on safari and sketching away and it's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.310 
on safari and sketching away and it's
much<00:03:14.850> easier<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.300> work<00:03:15.390> from<00:03:15.600> photographs<00:03:16.140> of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
much easier to work from photographs of

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.110 
much easier to work from photographs of
course<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.980> there's<00:03:17.550> something<00:03:17.940> lovely

getting<00:04:51.480> up<00:04:51.570> onto<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.310> tip<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.630> using<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.080> on

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
getting up onto the tip so using it on

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.780 
getting up onto the tip so using it on
its<00:04:55.380> tip<00:04:55.650> for<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.950> detail<00:04:56.520> I<00:05:00.590> mean<00:05:01.790> coming

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
its tip for the detail I mean coming

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.090 
its tip for the detail I mean coming
back<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:05.900> just<00:05:06.900> use<00:05:07.230> your<00:05:07.440> negative<00:05:07.860> space

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
back in I just use your negative space

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.350 
back in I just use your negative space
to<00:05:08.550> draw<00:05:08.790> so<00:05:09.180> once<00:05:09.840> I've<00:05:09.990> got<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.260> trunk<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:10.800> I

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
to draw so once I've got the trunk in I

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.820 
to draw so once I've got the trunk in I
can<00:05:12.360> just<00:05:12.510> look<00:05:12.690> at<00:05:12.870> where<00:05:13.050> these<00:05:13.230> legs<00:05:13.650> are

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
can just look at where these legs are

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.020 
can just look at where these legs are
coming

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.280 

let's<00:05:18.030> get<00:05:18.180> your<00:05:18.360> cross<00:05:18.630> like<00:05:18.870> that<00:05:19.080> knowing

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
let's get your cross like that knowing

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.250 
let's get your cross like that knowing
full<00:05:19.590> well<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:20.510> I'll<00:05:21.510> come<00:05:21.750> back<00:05:21.900> in<00:05:22.110> and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
full well that I'll come back in and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.910 
full well that I'll come back in and
correct<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.770> later<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.200> whole<00:05:25.440> area<00:05:25.860> is

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
correct that later so this whole area is

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.490 
correct that later so this whole area is
in<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> dark<00:05:26.630> I'm<00:05:27.630> going<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.930> use<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.200> sideways

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
in the dark I'm going to use it sideways

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.540 
in the dark I'm going to use it sideways
on<00:05:28.890> just<00:05:29.130> to<00:05:29.280> block<00:05:29.520> in<00:05:30.320> like<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:32.310> side

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
on just to block in like that the side

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.800 
on just to block in like that the side
of<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.760> legs<00:05:32.970> got<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> lot<00:05:33.540> of<00:05:33.570> dark<00:05:34.350> tone<00:05:34.830> on<00:05:35.160> it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
of the legs got a lot of dark tone on it

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.010 
of the legs got a lot of dark tone on it
their<00:05:36.810> knees<00:05:37.050> are<00:05:37.080> very<00:05:37.320> very<00:05:37.740> low<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.960> you

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
their knees are very very low so you

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.530 
their knees are very very low so you
need<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.320> observe<00:05:40.590> that<00:05:43.100> no<00:05:44.100> I'm<00:05:44.910> going<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.270> cut

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
need to observe that no I'm going to cut

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.260 
need to observe that no I'm going to cut
this<00:05:45.690> ear<00:05:45.990> back<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.290> little<00:05:46.620> because<00:05:47.010> my<00:05:47.880> first

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
this ear back a little because my first

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.850 
this ear back a little because my first
sketch<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:49.290> put<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.280> on<00:05:50.520> far<00:05:51.150> too<00:05:51.180> wide<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:52.470> the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
sketch I put it on far too wide and the

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.080 
sketch I put it on far too wide and the
way<00:05:52.980> that<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:54.350> remove<00:05:55.350> any<00:05:55.770> sketch<00:05:56.310> marks<00:05:56.820> that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
way that I remove any sketch marks that

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.469 
way that I remove any sketch marks that
I<00:05:57.150> don't<00:05:57.600> want<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.229> just<00:05:59.010> take<00:05:59.760> the<00:05:59.940> water<00:06:00.090> brush

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
I don't want I just take the water brush

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.380 
I don't want I just take the water brush
and<00:06:02.990> dissolve<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.350> pinch<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.970> then<00:06:06.180> just

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
and dissolve the pinch and then just

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.740 
and dissolve the pinch and then just
lift<00:06:06.540> it<00:06:06.690> off<00:06:07.640> like<00:06:08.640> that<00:06:08.850> so<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:09.300> very<00:06:09.690> very

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
lift it off like that so it is very very

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.560 
lift it off like that so it is very very
forgiving<00:06:10.460> so<00:06:11.460> wonderful<00:06:11.940> for<00:06:11.970> sketching

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
forgiving so wonderful for sketching

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.260 
forgiving so wonderful for sketching
outdoors<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:14.070> I've<00:06:14.400> got<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.700> end<00:06:14.910> better

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
outdoors and I've got the end better

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.960 
outdoors and I've got the end better
proportion<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:16.260> now<00:06:16.740> using<00:06:17.220> the<00:06:17.370> graphic

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
proportion and now using the graphic

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.670 
proportion and now using the graphic
turned<00:06:18.180> sideways<00:06:18.540> on<00:06:18.960> I'm<00:06:19.140> just<00:06:19.260> going<00:06:19.470> to<00:06:19.560> put

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
turned sideways on I'm just going to put

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.200 
turned sideways on I'm just going to put
these<00:06:19.800> folds<00:06:20.460> in<00:06:21.860> they<00:06:22.860> use<00:06:23.130> their<00:06:23.400> ears<00:06:23.669> to

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
these folds in they use their ears to

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.940 
these folds in they use their ears to
flap<00:06:24.810> an<00:06:25.020> awful<00:06:25.380> lot<00:06:26.750> not<00:06:27.750> only<00:06:27.810> to<00:06:28.110> fan<00:06:28.680> them

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
flap an awful lot not only to fan them

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.250 
flap an awful lot not only to fan them
and<00:06:29.340> keep<00:06:29.610> them<00:06:29.790> cool<00:06:30.180> but<00:06:30.479> also<00:06:30.660> as<00:06:30.900> a<00:06:31.020> means

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
and keep them cool but also as a means

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.040 
and keep them cool but also as a means
of<00:06:31.470> communication<00:06:32.240> get<00:06:33.240> going<00:06:33.479> and<00:06:33.630> do<00:06:33.870> the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
of communication get going and do the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.920 
of communication get going and do the
eye<00:06:34.350> and<00:06:35.310> that's<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.180> time<00:06:36.390> I'm<00:06:36.600> just<00:06:36.630> going

eye and that's the time I'm just going

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.000 
eye and that's the time I'm just going
to<00:06:36.990> wet<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.530> graph<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.860> turn<00:06:38.100> like<00:06:38.370> that<00:06:39.500> and<00:06:40.500> of

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
to wet the graph a turn like that and of

to wet the graph a turn like that and of
course<00:06:41.070> that<00:06:41.310> releases<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.000> tremendous<00:06:42.270> amount

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
course that releases a tremendous amount

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.750 
course that releases a tremendous amount
of<00:06:43.290> the<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:44.460> turn<00:06:44.820> I<00:06:45.890> know<00:06:46.890> I<00:06:47.100> can<00:06:47.370> put<00:06:47.610> the

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
of the the turn I know I can put the

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.750 
of the the turn I know I can put the
darkest<00:06:48.330> darks<00:06:48.750> in<00:06:49.070> now<00:06:50.070> that<00:06:50.340> it's<00:06:50.490> nice<00:06:50.700> and

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
darkest darks in now that it's nice and

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.890 
darkest darks in now that it's nice and
wet

wet
use<00:06:53.900> it<00:06:54.050> sideways<00:06:54.469> on<00:06:56.289> and<00:06:57.289> get<00:06:57.469> the<00:06:57.620> very<00:06:57.919> dark

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189 
use it sideways on and get the very dark

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:05.439 
use it sideways on and get the very dark
areas<00:06:58.610> in<00:07:01.900> get<00:07:02.900> it<00:07:02.990> back<00:07:03.259> up<00:07:03.469> onto<00:07:03.680> the<00:07:04.270> tip<00:07:05.270> of

areas in get it back up onto the tip of
the<00:07:06.310> graph<00:07:07.310> a<00:07:07.460> turn<00:07:08.439> because<00:07:09.439> I'm<00:07:09.620> looking

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
the graph a turn because I'm looking

the graph a turn because I'm looking
forward<00:07:10.819> to<00:07:10.969> doing<00:07:11.180> the<00:07:11.360> trunk<00:07:11.810> and<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.110> these

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
forward to doing the trunk and all these

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.040 
forward to doing the trunk and all these
wonderful<00:07:12.699> rings<00:07:13.699> that<00:07:14.120> are<00:07:14.240> on<00:07:14.419> the<00:07:14.599> trunk

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
wonderful rings that are on the trunk

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.800 
wonderful rings that are on the trunk
and<00:07:15.400> this<00:07:16.400> is<00:07:16.550> the<00:07:16.699> time<00:07:17.000> to<00:07:17.240> go<00:07:17.389> in<00:07:17.479> and<00:07:17.659> do

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
and this is the time to go in and do

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.320 
and this is the time to go in and do
that<00:07:18.280> and<00:07:19.280> just<00:07:19.430> check<00:07:19.699> that<00:07:19.879> I've<00:07:20.000> got<00:07:20.210> the

that and just check that I've got the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.709 
that and just check that I've got the
areas<00:07:20.689> dark<00:07:21.050> enough<00:07:21.289> where<00:07:21.530> they<00:07:21.620> need<00:07:21.800> to<00:07:21.830> be

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:22.719 
areas dark enough where they need to be

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.990 
areas dark enough where they need to be
such<00:07:23.719> as<00:07:23.900> here<00:07:24.169> and<00:07:24.229> once<00:07:24.409> again<00:07:24.729> using<00:07:25.729> the
