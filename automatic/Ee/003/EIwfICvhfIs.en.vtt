00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.900
 We want to face the game 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.689
 for what it means to be once 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.540
 more in one in a semifinal we return to 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.600
 play against a great team 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.990
 like the bayern if it's true that 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.440
 did not come back as the term of knowledge 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.960
 in the end as we fell, a lot happened 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.750
 time of that we not only arrived from another 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.779
 way I believe them they also the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.400
 team is different so what's going to be 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.260
 another game totally different from what 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.120
 that another eliminator what was in that 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.460
 at that time it was not an excuse for 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.040
 us at that time and I think that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.199
 no excuse for the bayern are two 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.350
 very large teams that have a lot 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.170
 history that they have plenty of staff 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.470
 more that they have important players 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.690
 I think it injured no excuse 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 neither for us nor for me for it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.559
 how is it that there are only two teams 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.019
 too big to look for that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.140
 excuse then and pressure to this height 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.140
 I think that none has pressure or if 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.400
 we have the obligation the two teams of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.680
 put us in that final for what he said 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.500
 before and I repeat again for the greatness 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.049
 of the clubs for what it means to be 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.460
 in Barcelona in the back city ​​and that 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.770
 we are always obligated both 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.140
 teams 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 to try to get everything for the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.320
 greatness of the club 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.010
 I think he knows us all well 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.650
 He spent a lot of time with 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.840
 with us we live many things 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.880
 important we were lucky to 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 get 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.750
 many titles and I think not only to me 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.820
 but to all the players he had 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.360
 I knew him what he did not also because he is 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.070
 a coach who studies everything and does not leave 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.080
 nothing at random for what it meant to see 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.060
 how to coach why 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.760
 because he won everything when he was here 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.790
 because it gave him a lot 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.380
 to this club because from the normal house 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.720
 but once the match starts I think 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.840
 that is left out and people from 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.960
 barcelona goes to hook so that 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.960
 that in that team as is normal
