00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
field and were just a booger open and it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
field and were just a booger open and it
was<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> only<00:01:58.680> method<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> said<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
was the only method but like I said I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
was the only method but like I said I
don't<00:02:03.540> peep<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.869> tell<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.409> difference<00:02:04.740> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
don't peep you tell the difference in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.389 
don't peep you tell the difference in
diameter

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
diameter

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.609 
diameter
but<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.670> think<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.209> lot<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.390> guys<00:02:08.660> are<00:02:09.170> getting

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
but I think a lot of guys are getting

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.160 
but I think a lot of guys are getting
the<00:02:10.190> long<00:02:10.369> reach<00:02:10.550> tool<00:02:10.879> in<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.989> bigger

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
the long reach tool in the bigger

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.720 
the long reach tool in the bigger
diameter<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:15.160> obviously<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.610> lot

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
diameter and obviously it's a lot

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.199 
diameter and obviously it's a lot
tougher<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.830> or<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.010> need<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.340> working

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
tougher to or you need more working

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.500 
tougher to or you need more working

there on the Toyotas the lip on the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.690 
there on the Toyotas the lip on the
inside<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.569> lot<00:03:09.170> thicker<00:03:09.829> than<00:03:10.280> what's<00:03:10.579> on
