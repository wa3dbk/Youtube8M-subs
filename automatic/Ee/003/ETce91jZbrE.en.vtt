 utc but it had better university the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.480
 summary of the match with comments 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 from flavio francisco who was given 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.019
 the summary of the game arrives thanks to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.980
 a moment in our life your mix that 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.610
 capture those moments 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.610
 panasonic 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 let's summarize the match a first 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.670
 precise time with the ball both 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.340
 teams take advantage of it more etc yes but it's 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.990
 university that is warning with this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.600
 ruiz díaz's shot is a long pass 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.869
 looking for the front speed of 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.369
 academic 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.950
 perhaps already warning what was going to be 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.990
 noises in this game 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.009
 and here appears the one of udc not a 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.170
 projection of his right side 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.600
 breaking the high line of university 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.640
 a good play together and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.979
 defining molina not only has it 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 to play a good collective play of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 utc 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.050
 in the party not occupying well the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.230
 spaces the defender use and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.260
 enabling the front d 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.270
 of utc and the same does university 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.310
 answering here to rainer towers that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 they do this very well when they decide 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.910
 face to have control of the ball is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.660
 get through the middle of the utc defense 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.960
 breaking the entire defensive line 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.220
 clearly not center of the area and there 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.980
 the scorer has to be 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 just touch the knees to put 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.950
 the tie 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.010
 you have one time more control of 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 ball generating attack situation as 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.770
 we see mangold center what he has done 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.930
 by right handle during all the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.360
 party overflowing getting center 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 looking for some head and against 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.790
 second time is looking for the 1 waves 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.040
 winning in the defender position 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.750
 putting the center and Fernandez and the out 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.489
 of the arizmendi line that makes a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.230
 moment had nodded a ball since 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.710
 the goal comes if one comes 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.270
 again 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.460
 what many had not done 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.980
 university students relocate field 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.810
 to the opposite field with speed with that 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.880
 how fast does the contra have to 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.450
 he did reign towers very well the goals of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.000
 society the Jewish imagery is not 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.370
 move does not have was also and define 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.650
 very well ruiz díaz looks for it above and 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.920
 after the sun after the goal is 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.320
 I think it's the one that's the most 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.080
 about it is what you what life was 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.460
 uv is blunt today had it 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.380
 forcefulness because it was few 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.240
 goal situations for those converted if 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.430
 you generated a little more 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.100
 and you want after the goal of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.710
 university gets gets out many 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.230
 front and ends does not have people to 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.490
 touching one hand is the one that was collected 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.900
 meters in the middle but did not have the 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.160
 partner to build plays because he has 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.260
 why because he had four strikers 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.660
 we were all going to look inside the area 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.910
 but in any case three points of the 1 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.310
 yes ready friends thank you for having us 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.320
