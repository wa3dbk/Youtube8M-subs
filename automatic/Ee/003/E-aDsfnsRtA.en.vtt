00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
common that people do is really a drive

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.860 
common that people do is really a drive
from<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.760> energy<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> wrist<00:01:03.450> to<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
from the energy of the wrist to the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
from the energy of the wrist to the
elbow<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.410> then<00:01:04.559> back<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:05.009> opponent

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
elbow and then back to the opponent

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
elbow and then back to the opponent
because<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> okay<00:01:06.660> so<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.350> throw<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
because of that okay so if you throw a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.040 
because of that okay so if you throw a
pot<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.039> rewarded<00:01:08.820> alright<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
pot you get rewarded alright and the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.749 
pot you get rewarded alright and the
strike<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.500> anything<00:01:10.800> any<00:01:11.039> pocket<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.580> can

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
strike can be anything any pocket I can

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.600 
strike can be anything any pocket I can
so<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:12.690> can<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:13.080> inside<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.710> strikes<00:01:14.220> here<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so I can get inside the strikes here to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
so I can get inside the strikes here to
break<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.789> by<00:01:15.000> structure<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.840> turning<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
break the by structure the turning of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
break the by structure the turning of
the<00:01:16.259> wrist<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.770> turn<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> energy<00:01:17.250> back<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the wrist to turn the energy back to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
the wrist to turn the energy back to
elbow<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:19.050> shifting<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.500> weight<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:19.800> make

elbow this shifting the weight to make

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
elbow this shifting the weight to make
them<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.160> down<00:01:20.540> okay<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.930> doesn't<00:01:22.290> matter<00:01:22.350> if

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
them go down okay and doesn't matter if

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
them go down okay and doesn't matter if
he's<00:01:22.590> big<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.159> matter<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
he's big doesn't matter how have you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
he's big doesn't matter how have you
used<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.740> much<00:01:25.920> works<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
used because it's very much works on the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
used because it's very much works on the
same<00:01:26.520> principles<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> judo<00:01:27.330> throw<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> get

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
same principles a judo throw if you get

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
same principles a judo throw if you get
a<00:01:28.439> guy<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.830> hip<00:01:29.189> you're<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.640> tipping<00:01:30.030> over

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
a guy over hip you're just tipping over

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
a guy over hip you're just tipping over
this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> push<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> pivot<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this is not a push this is a pivot to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
this is not a push this is a pivot to
take<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> put<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.409> works<00:01:34.770> well

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
take the put it down so it works well

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
take the put it down so it works well
without<00:01:35.340> without<00:01:36.150> having<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> feel<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
without without having to feel like you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:37.820 
without without having to feel like you
have<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> fight<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
shoulders most likely be using it back
