logically<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.360> cannot<00:03:55.600> start<00:03:55.989> just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
logically that you cannot start just

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.979 
logically that you cannot start just
tearing<00:03:56.620> up<00:03:56.850> may<00:03:57.850> not<00:03:58.030> happen<00:03:58.150> villages<00:03:58.690> years

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
tearing up may not happen villages years

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.020 
tearing up may not happen villages years
later<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.500> point<00:03:59.769> year<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.519> very<00:04:00.790> much

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
later but this point year is very much

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.300 
later but this point year is very much
legal<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.900> rules<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.470> cannot<00:04:03.130> just

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
legal is in the rules so you cannot just

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.880 
legal is in the rules so you cannot just
go<00:04:03.489> conquering<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.120> need<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.269> reason<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:05.800> know

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
go conquering you need a reason you know

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.530

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:40.649 
Big Ben the naval systems good is there

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:42.379 
Big Ben the naval systems good is there
wasn't<00:04:40.919> many<00:04:40.979> great<00:04:41.279> naval<00:04:41.520> battles<00:04:41.999> the<00:04:42.119> eula

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
wasn't many great naval battles the eula

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.059 
wasn't many great naval battles the eula
right<00:04:42.749> but<00:04:42.930> we<00:04:43.050> will<00:04:43.199> have<00:04:43.229> like<00:04:43.589> mountain

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
right but we will have like mountain

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.029 
right but we will have like mountain
fleets<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:45.089> you<00:04:45.149> paint<00:04:45.629> minutes<00:04:46.050> the

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
fleets so you paint minutes the

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.429 
fleets so you paint minutes the
transport<00:04:47.490> your<00:04:47.610> men<00:04:47.789> ok<00:04:48.779> because<00:04:49.289> it's

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
transport your men ok because it's

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.139 
transport your men ok because it's
nelson<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.219> then<00:04:50.339> the<00:04:50.490> time<00:04:50.639> they<00:04:50.789> conceive

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:51.149 
nelson and then the time they conceive

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.420 
nelson and then the time they conceive
of<00:04:51.330> loot<00:04:52.199> constantinople<00:04:53.189> and<00:04:55.039> yeah<00:04:56.039> so<00:04:56.279> we

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
of loot constantinople and yeah so we

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.589 
of loot constantinople and yeah so we
have<00:04:56.550> some<00:04:56.759> time<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.149> move<00:04:57.240> my<00:04:57.389> way<00:04:57.539> to

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
have some time to move my way to

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.269 
have some time to move my way to
actually<00:04:57.839> the<00:04:58.439> mountain<00:04:58.770> Republic<00:04:59.159> supply

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
actually the mountain Republic supply

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.239 
actually the mountain Republic supply
ships<00:05:00.050> as<00:05:01.050> well<00:05:01.229> as<00:05:01.379> our<00:05:01.529> goal<00:05:01.770> being<00:05:02.039> or<00:05:02.189> not

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 
ships as well as our goal being or not

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.040 
ships as well as our goal being or not
there<00:05:02.669> was<00:05:02.849> an<00:05:02.999> able<00:05:03.210> implementation<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.020> a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
there was an able implementation to a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.799 
there was an able implementation to a
great<00:05:04.469> he'll<00:05:04.919> probably<00:05:05.129> change<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.819> bit<00:05:05.999> as<00:05:06.629> we

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:06.809 
great he'll probably change a bit as we

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.420 
great he'll probably change a bit as we
start<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.139> implementation<00:05:07.770> process<00:05:07.800> for

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.230 
we have in our design and kind of list
of<00:05:33.980> kind<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:36.130> few<00:05:37.130> chips<00:05:37.370> you<00:05:37.940> know<00:05:38.030> these

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
of kind of a few chips you know these

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.440 
of kind of a few chips you know these
are<00:05:38.300> em<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:39.740> know<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.100> cool<00:05:40.430> they'll<00:05:41.420> be

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
are em you know the cool they'll be

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.000 
are em you know the cool they'll be
great<00:05:41.750> for<00:05:41.930> them<00:05:42.050> but<00:05:42.260> they're<00:05:42.350> not<00:05:42.440> central

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
great for them but they're not central

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.440 
great for them but they're not central
so<00:05:43.250> they're<00:05:43.400> like<00:05:43.490> they'll<00:05:44.210> be<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.420> first

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
so they're like they'll be the first

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.200 
so they're like they'll be the first
ones<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.900> because<00:05:45.200> if<00:05:45.530> we<00:05:45.820> join<00:05:46.820> em<00:05:46.970> from<00:05:47.090> the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
ones to because if we join em from the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.940 
ones to because if we join em from the
cuff<00:05:47.390> you<00:05:47.540> just<00:05:47.720> redevelopment<00:05:48.260> so<00:05:48.350> we've<00:05:48.830> got

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
cuff you just redevelopment so we've got

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.190 
cuff you just redevelopment so we've got
the<00:05:49.010> whole<00:05:49.040> idea<00:05:49.280> of<00:05:49.490> relevance<00:05:50.110> you<00:05:51.110> know

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
the whole idea of relevance you know

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.650 
the whole idea of relevance you know
that<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:51.740> know<00:05:51.860> cathedrals<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:52.910> relics<00:05:53.360> and

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
that you know cathedrals and relics and

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.170 
that you know cathedrals and relics and
people<00:05:54.350> with<00:05:54.500> Wars<00:05:54.860> to<00:05:55.280> steal<00:05:55.520> relics<00:05:55.970> rather

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
people with Wars to steal relics rather

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.630 
people with Wars to steal relics rather
people<00:05:56.630> so<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:57.320> know<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.560> can<00:05:58.280> go<00:05:58.430> around

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
people so you know you can go around

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.310 
people so you know you can go around
that<00:05:59.030> there<00:05:59.270> were<00:05:59.480> also<00:05:59.630> thinking<00:05:59.840> about<00:05:59.990> like

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
that there were also thinking about like

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.860 
that there were also thinking about like
ranking<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:01.070> relics<00:06:01.400> so<00:06:02.090> if<00:06:02.570> you<00:06:02.720> have<00:06:02.840> a

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
ranking the relics so if you have a

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.900 
ranking the relics so if you have a
really<00:06:03.080> really<00:06:03.350> big<00:06:03.560> Cathedral<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.580> need<00:06:04.760> an

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
really really big Cathedral you need an

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.230
