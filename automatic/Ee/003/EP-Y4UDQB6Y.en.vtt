necessary tools in my shop I could
probably<00:00:09.870> build<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.410> cabinet<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:10.980> this

probably build a cabinet like this

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.560 
probably build a cabinet like this
without<00:00:11.340> too<00:00:11.550> much<00:00:11.670> effort<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.360> pretty

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
without too much effort it's a pretty

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.589 
without too much effort it's a pretty
basic<00:00:12.750> design<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:14.360> wouldn't<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.450> too

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
basic design and wouldn't be too

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.630 
basic design and wouldn't be too
difficult<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.020> put<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.379> together<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.400> since

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
difficult to put one together but since

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.689 
difficult to put one together but since
I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.390> went<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.050> Ikea<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> high

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I don't I went to Ikea and got this high

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.450 
I don't I went to Ikea and got this high
quality<00:00:21.210> nice<00:00:21.960> widely<00:00:22.380> available<00:00:22.470> cabinet

quality nice widely available cabinet

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
quality nice widely available cabinet
system<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.000> comes<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.449> plastic<00:00:24.900> bins<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
system that comes with plastic bins and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
system that comes with plastic bins and
works<00:00:26.250> great<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.640> toy<00:00:27.180> storage<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.080> our

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
works great for toy storage or in our

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
works great for toy storage or in our
case<00:00:28.260> Lego<00:00:29.099> storage

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520 

now<00:00:34.120> since<00:00:34.390> these<00:00:34.540> two<00:00:34.750> cabinets<00:00:35.230> would<00:00:35.380> be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
now since these two cabinets would be

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.860 
now since these two cabinets would be
sitting<00:00:35.950> up<00:00:36.130> against<00:00:36.460> each<00:00:36.579> other<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:37.000> didn't

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
sitting up against each other I didn't

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.470 
sitting up against each other I didn't
want<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.440> bins<00:00:38.950> on<00:00:39.250> one<00:00:39.520> side<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:40.000> push<00:00:40.270> out

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
want the bins on one side to push out

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.819 
want the bins on one side to push out
the<00:00:40.600> bins<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.020> opposite<00:00:41.379> side<00:00:41.559> so<00:00:41.590> I

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
the bins on the opposite side so I

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.890 
the bins on the opposite side so I
figured<00:00:42.190> we<00:00:42.340> needed<00:00:42.550> some<00:00:42.970> kind<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.239> stopper

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
figured we needed some kind of stopper

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.360 
figured we needed some kind of stopper
in<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.410> middle<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.890> keep<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.220> from

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
in the middle to keep that from

00:00:45.370 --> 00:01:06.450 
in the middle to keep that from
happening

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.920 

next<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.550> took<00:01:07.730> each<00:01:07.880> stopper<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.900> a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
next I took each stopper and with a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.960 
next I took each stopper and with a
little<00:01:09.200> bit<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.380> what<00:01:09.500> glue<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.890> glued<00:01:10.340> each<00:01:10.670> one

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
little bit of what glue I glued each one

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.290 
little bit of what glue I glued each one
into<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.020> end<00:01:12.230> of<00:01:12.500> each<00:01:12.950> drawer<00:01:13.340> slide<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:13.970> one

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
into the end of each drawer slide on one

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.490 
into the end of each drawer slide on one
side<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.650> cabinets<00:01:17.380> ended<00:01:18.380> up

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
side of one of the cabinets ended up

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.940 
side of one of the cabinets ended up
being<00:01:18.740> 18<00:01:19.370> Stoppers<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.030> all<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:23.800> they<00:01:24.800> work

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
being 18 Stoppers and all and they work

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.180 
being 18 Stoppers and all and they work
great<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:27.110> prepare<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:27.710> bolting<00:01:28.070> these

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
great to prepare for bolting these

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.400 
great to prepare for bolting these
cabinets<00:01:28.670> together<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:29.050> removed<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:30.260> just

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
cabinets together I removed and just

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.170 
cabinets together I removed and just
double<00:01:30.619> check<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.100> length<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.550> these<00:01:31.670> screws

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
double check the length of these screws

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.370 
double check the length of these screws
make<00:01:32.990> sure<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.200> didn't<00:01:33.410> hit<00:01:33.560> them<00:01:33.680> with<00:01:33.920> bolts

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
make sure I didn't hit them with bolts

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.960 
make sure I didn't hit them with bolts
then<00:01:36.380> based<00:01:36.650> on<00:01:36.860> those<00:01:36.979> measurements<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.790> made

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
then based on those measurements I made

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.540 
then based on those measurements I made
a<00:01:38.000> simple<00:01:38.270> drilling<00:01:38.750> template<00:01:39.140> on<00:01:39.259> paper<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.520> I

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
a simple drilling template on paper so I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.370 
a simple drilling template on paper so I
could<00:01:40.790> consistently<00:01:41.270> lay<00:01:41.600> out<00:01:41.750> all<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.200> bolt

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
could consistently lay out all the bolt

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.639 
could consistently lay out all the bolt
holes<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.040> would<00:01:43.250> need<00:01:44.380> using<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.470> paper

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
holes that I would need using the paper

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.830 
holes that I would need using the paper
template<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.280> at<00:01:46.460> all<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:47.210> able<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.509> lay

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
template and at all I was able to lay

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.380 
template and at all I was able to lay
out<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.259> drill<00:01:48.710> four<00:01:49.130> holes<00:01:49.160> in<00:01:49.670> each<00:01:49.820> cabinet

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
out and drill four holes in each cabinet

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.389 
out and drill four holes in each cabinet
you'll<00:01:51.200> notice<00:01:51.500> on<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.040> it's<00:01:52.190> on<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
you'll notice on this one it's on the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.460 
you'll notice on this one it's on the
same<00:01:52.640> side<00:01:52.940> as<00:01:53.240> all<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.690> stop<00:01:54.080> blocks<00:01:54.320> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
same side as all of the stop blocks that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.999 
same side as all of the stop blocks that
we<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.800> glued<00:01:55.040> in<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:56.270> just<00:01:56.450> mark<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.780> hole

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
we just glued in so just mark the hole

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.180 
we just glued in so just mark the hole
come<00:01:58.009> back<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.430> drill<00:01:58.700> and<00:02:00.040> clear<00:02:01.040> that

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
come back with a drill and clear that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:10.059 
come back with a drill and clear that
one<00:02:01.340> out<00:02:08.080> then<00:02:09.080> do<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.350> same<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
one out then do the same thing in the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.790 
one out then do the same thing in the
other<00:02:10.190> three<00:02:10.490> corners<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:15.410> switch

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
other three corners and then switch

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:27.429 
other three corners and then switch
cabinets<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:18.100> four<00:02:19.100> more<00:02:19.310> holes

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.500 

now<00:02:28.439> with<00:02:28.799> four<00:02:29.129> strategically<00:02:29.879> placed<00:02:30.180> bolt

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
now with four strategically placed bolt

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.630 
now with four strategically placed bolt
holes<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.959> each<00:02:31.140> cabinet<00:02:31.620> bolting<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> units

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
holes in each cabinet bolting the units

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
holes in each cabinet bolting the units
together<00:02:32.790> isn't<00:02:33.150> too<00:02:33.299> difficult<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:34.680> case

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
together isn't too difficult in my case

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.929 
together isn't too difficult in my case
I<00:02:35.099> used<00:02:35.370> 5/16<00:02:36.269> bolts<00:02:36.750> washers<00:02:37.469> and<00:02:37.980> nylon<00:02:38.640> lock

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
I used 5/16 bolts washers and nylon lock

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:49.569 
I used 5/16 bolts washers and nylon lock
nuts<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.870> assemble<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.469> two<00:02:40.799> units<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.459> one

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.369 

and<00:02:50.579> those<00:02:51.000> bolts<00:02:51.420> are<00:02:51.599> pretty<00:02:52.019> well<00:02:52.170> hidden

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
and those bolts are pretty well hidden

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.430 
and those bolts are pretty well hidden
out<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.650> sight

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.290 

it<00:02:57.010> was<00:02:57.160> at<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.400> point<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.880> found<00:02:58.150> out

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
it was at this point that I found out

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:09.780 
it was at this point that I found out
I'd<00:02:58.480> built<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.810> pretty<00:02:59.050> awesome<00:02:59.260> tunnel<00:03:08.790> next

custom top for this table earlier I had

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.820 
custom top for this table earlier I had
measured<00:03:19.270> up<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.600> final<00:03:20.230> length<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.650> width

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
measured up the final length and width

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.670 
measured up the final length and width
of<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.400> two<00:03:21.610> assembled<00:03:22.150> cabinets<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.900> then

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
of the two assembled cabinets and then

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.620 
of the two assembled cabinets and then
added<00:03:24.160> 5/8<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.760> an<00:03:24.850> inch<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.240> overall

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.620 
width and length and that's the size of
the<00:03:30.100> MDF<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.820> will<00:03:30.940> be<00:03:31.030> cutting<00:03:31.210> out<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630

tabletop

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.080

I<00:03:33.990> used<00:03:34.990> this<00:03:35.140> half<00:03:35.590> inch<00:03:35.860> thick<00:03:36.190> sheet<00:03:36.490> of<00:03:36.640> MDF

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
I used this half inch thick sheet of MDF

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.580 
I used this half inch thick sheet of MDF
mainly<00:03:37.510> because<00:03:37.660> I've<00:03:37.870> had<00:03:37.960> a<00:03:37.990> nice<00:03:38.170> smooth

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
mainly because I've had a nice smooth

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.110 
mainly because I've had a nice smooth
finish<00:03:38.920> which<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.550> work<00:03:39.730> well<00:03:39.940> for

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
finish which would work well for

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.510 
finish which would work well for
painting<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.710> bonus<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.950> was<00:03:42.070> pretty<00:03:42.280> cheap

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
paint the tabletop we used a combination

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.300 
paint the tabletop we used a combination
paint<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.900> primer<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.440> one<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.980> had<00:04:30.280> a

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
paint and primer and one that had a

paint and primer and one that had a
pretty<00:04:30.580> high<00:04:30.820> durability<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.660> gave<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.560> a

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
pretty high durability and gave it a

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.250 
pretty high durability and gave it a
couple<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.890> coats<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> perfect

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
couple of coats this is a perfect

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.659 
couple of coats this is a perfect
opportunity<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.830> get<00:04:36.010> your<00:04:36.160> kids<00:04:36.370> involved

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
opportunity to get your kids involved

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.000 
opportunity to get your kids involved
because<00:04:37.060> painting<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.690> fairly<00:04:38.050> easy<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.560> it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
because painting is fairly easy and it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.590 
because painting is fairly easy and it
doesn't<00:04:39.250> have<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.460> be<00:04:39.580> perfect

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
doesn't have to be perfect

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.840 
doesn't have to be perfect
I<00:04:41.660> wanted<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.710> sides<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.280> table<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.700> have

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
I wanted the sides of the table to have

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.180 
I wanted the sides of the table to have
just<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.240> slight<00:04:44.450> shine<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.200> them<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.560> match<00:04:45.980> the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
just a slight shine to them to match the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.710 
just a slight shine to them to match the
look<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.610> rest<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> cabinet<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.540> it

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
look of the rest of the cabinet and it

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.170 
look of the rest of the cabinet and it
just<00:04:48.260> make<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.470> look<00:04:48.650> nice<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.730> set<00:04:50.000> them<00:04:50.090> up

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
just make it look nice so I set them up

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.060 
just make it look nice so I set them up
on<00:04:50.300> these<00:04:50.450> makeshift<00:04:50.930> cardboard<00:04:51.500> sawhorses

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
on these makeshift cardboard sawhorses

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.950 
on these makeshift cardboard sawhorses
and<00:04:52.250> just<00:04:52.520> gave<00:04:52.700> a<00:04:52.730> light<00:04:53.690> coat<00:04:53.930> of

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
and just gave a light coat of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650 
and just gave a light coat of
polyurethane<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:55.160> get<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.910> look<00:04:56.150> before<00:04:56.450> I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
polyurethane to get that look before I

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.760 
polyurethane to get that look before I
cut<00:04:56.930> them<00:04:56.960> up<00:04:57.170> into<00:04:57.410> smaller<00:04:57.650> pieces<00:04:59.770> once

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
cut them up into smaller pieces once

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.260 
cut them up into smaller pieces once
everything<00:05:01.160> was<00:05:01.190> dry<00:05:01.460> it<00:05:01.550> was<00:05:01.730> back<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.240> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
everything was dry it was back to the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.540 
everything was dry it was back to the
table<00:05:02.660> saw<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.900> cut<00:05:03.410> down<00:05:03.590> each<00:05:03.920> piece<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:04.490> the

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
table saw to cut down each piece for the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.990 
table saw to cut down each piece for the
sides<00:05:05.230> first<00:05:06.230> I<00:05:06.440> rough<00:05:06.770> cut<00:05:07.040> them<00:05:07.280> a<00:05:07.490> little

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
sides first I rough cut them a little

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.320 
sides first I rough cut them a little
bit<00:05:08.090> larger<00:05:08.450> than<00:05:08.600> they<00:05:08.690> needed<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.990> be<00:05:10.330> size

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
bit larger than they needed to be size

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:19.390 
bit larger than they needed to be size
them<00:05:11.600> up<00:05:11.750> on<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.290> tabletop<00:05:17.770> got<00:05:18.770> them<00:05:18.950> close

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
them up on the tabletop got them close

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.290 
them up on the tabletop got them close
this<00:05:20.120> one's<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.450> little<00:05:20.540> bit<00:05:20.720> long<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.230> just

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
this one's a little bit long and just

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.700 
this one's a little bit long and just
shaved<00:05:23.300> each<00:05:23.480> one<00:05:23.720> down<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.020> little<00:05:24.350> bit<00:05:24.470> until

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
shaved each one down a little bit until

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.390 
shaved each one down a little bit until
they<00:05:24.830> fit<00:05:26.230> I'd<00:05:27.230> recommend<00:05:27.680> starting<00:05:28.160> with<00:05:28.310> the

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
they fit I'd recommend starting with the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.490 
they fit I'd recommend starting with the
long<00:05:28.640> side<00:05:28.970> first<00:05:29.330> so<00:05:29.660> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.110> cut<00:05:30.290> them<00:05:30.380> down

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
long side first so if you cut them down

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.290 
long side first so if you cut them down
too<00:05:30.740> short<00:05:31.040> you<00:05:31.370> can<00:05:31.520> at<00:05:31.580> least<00:05:31.610> turn<00:05:32.150> them

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
too short you can at least turn them

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.330 
too short you can at least turn them
into<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.630> short<00:05:32.840> side<00:05:33.110> if<00:05:33.320> you<00:05:33.410> need<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:36.340> the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
into the short side if you need to the

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.220 
into the short side if you need to the
final<00:05:37.670> assembly<00:05:37.910> process<00:05:38.480> basically<00:05:38.750> came

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
final assembly process basically came

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.440 
final assembly process basically came
down<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.770> bunch<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.670> liberally<00:05:41.120> applied

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
down to a bunch of liberally applied

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.710 
down to a bunch of liberally applied
wood<00:05:41.750> glue<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.200> pipe<00:05:42.710> clamps<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.540> decided<00:05:44.540> not

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
wood glue and pipe clamps I decided not

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.510 
wood glue and pipe clamps I decided not
to<00:05:44.780> put<00:05:45.050> any<00:05:45.170> nails<00:05:45.560> or<00:05:45.770> screws<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:46.220> from<00:05:46.430> the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
to put any nails or screws in from the

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.910 
to put any nails or screws in from the
outside<00:05:46.670> mostly<00:05:47.330> for<00:05:47.510> aesthetics<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.140> the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
outside mostly for aesthetics and the

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.950 
outside mostly for aesthetics and the
glue<00:05:49.100> seemed<00:05:49.340> to<00:05:49.460> hold<00:05:49.550> up<00:05:49.760> well<00:05:49.940> enough<00:05:50.090> if

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
glue seemed to hold up well enough if

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.630 
glue seemed to hold up well enough if
you<00:05:51.650> really<00:05:51.860> wanted<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.190> make<00:05:52.280> this<00:05:52.430> thing

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
you really wanted to make this thing

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.490 
you really wanted to make this thing
strong<00:05:52.970> maybe<00:05:53.330> some<00:05:53.660> pocket<00:05:54.110> holes<00:05:54.320> and

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
strong maybe some pocket holes and

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.640 
strong maybe some pocket holes and
screws<00:05:54.770> from<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.070> bottom<00:05:55.250> would<00:05:55.550> work<00:05:56.650> use

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
screws from the bottom would work use

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.450 
screws from the bottom would work use
clamps<00:05:57.980> to<00:05:58.310> align<00:05:59.060> each<00:05:59.360> corner<00:06:03.130> wiped<00:06:04.130> up<00:06:04.310> any

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
clamps to align each corner wiped up any

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460 
clamps to align each corner wiped up any
excess<00:06:04.850> glue<00:06:05.030> from<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.480> top<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:08.110> then<00:06:09.110> flip

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
excess glue from the top and then flip

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.420 
excess glue from the top and then flip
the<00:06:09.590> whole<00:06:09.710> works<00:06:09.980> over<00:06:12.070> knock<00:06:13.070> it<00:06:13.250> down<00:06:13.280> a

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
the whole works over knock it down a

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.000 
the whole works over knock it down a
little<00:06:13.670> bit<00:06:13.910> to<00:06:14.090> make<00:06:14.240> sure<00:06:14.420> the<00:06:15.010> painted

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
little bit to make sure the painted

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.280 
little bit to make sure the painted
surface<00:06:16.400> would<00:06:16.610> look<00:06:17.150> flush<00:06:17.480> with<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.930> dado

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
surface would look flush with the dado

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.530 
surface would look flush with the dado
slots<00:06:18.650> and<00:06:18.920> then<00:06:19.310> added<00:06:19.670> some<00:06:19.700> glue<00:06:20.180> on<00:06:20.450> the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
slots and then added some glue on the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.400 
slots and then added some glue on the
backside<00:06:20.810> just<00:06:21.290> for<00:06:21.470> extra<00:06:21.890> strength

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
backside just for extra strength

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.200 
backside just for extra strength
once<00:06:24.410> all<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.680> glue<00:06:24.830> is<00:06:24.980> dry<00:06:25.220> just<00:06:25.670> set<00:06:26.060> it<00:06:26.150> on

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
once all the glue is dry just set it on

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.420 
once all the glue is dry just set it on
top<00:06:26.480> of<00:06:26.690> our<00:06:26.810> cabinets<00:06:27.410> and<00:06:27.710> it<00:06:27.860> fit<00:06:28.160> great

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
top of our cabinets and it fit great

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.130 
top of our cabinets and it fit great
