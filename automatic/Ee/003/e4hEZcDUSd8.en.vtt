around and destroys everything but there
is<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.760> time<00:01:41.060> limit<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.570> when<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.680> kill<00:01:42.979> the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
is a time limit and when you kill the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.760 
is a time limit and when you kill the
monsters<00:01:43.700> like<00:01:44.150> random<00:01:44.720> box<00:01:44.990> comes<00:01:45.350> out<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
monsters like random box comes out and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.580 
monsters like random box comes out and
then<00:01:45.890> those<00:01:46.070> boxes<00:01:46.670> get<00:01:46.970> like<00:01:47.380> different<00:01:48.380> guns

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
then those boxes get like different guns

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.450 
then those boxes get like different guns
randomized<00:01:49.190> guns<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:49.910> really<00:01:50.660> useful

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
randomized guns and it's really useful

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.070 
randomized guns and it's really useful
but<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.820> amount<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.360> kill<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.720> have<00:01:53.840> turns

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
but the amount of kill you have turns

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.810 
but the amount of kill you have turns
