00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is you can start it on different notes

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.039 
is you can start it on different notes
of<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> scale<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> started<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:03.049> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
of the scale so here I started on the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
of the scale so here I started on the
second<00:01:04.500> fret<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> scale<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.640> one

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
second fret of this scale I'm going one

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.710 
second fret of this scale I'm going one
I<00:01:07.250> can<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.400> start<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.240> snow<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I can also start it on this snow and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
I can also start it on this snow and
that<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:09.930> sound<00:01:10.080> like<00:01:10.170> this

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.230 

so<00:01:13.600> what<00:01:13.719> i'm<00:01:13.810> doing<00:01:13.929> here<00:01:14.079> is<00:01:14.500> four<00:01:15.369> three

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
so what i'm doing here is four three

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.120 
so what i'm doing here is four three
five<00:01:17.020> three<00:01:18.179> okay

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
five three okay

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.850 
five three okay
so<00:01:21.730> we<00:01:21.790> sort<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.060> took<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.300> motif<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.140> basic<00:01:23.530> idea

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
so we sort of took a motif a basic idea

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.250 
so we sort of took a motif a basic idea
and<00:01:24.100> now<00:01:24.340> we're<00:01:24.610> starting<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.600> on<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.780> different

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
and now we're starting it on a different

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.370 
and now we're starting it on a different
degree<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.770> scale<00:01:27.159> but<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:28.750> still<00:01:29.080> kind

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
degree of the scale but it's still kind

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.719 
degree of the scale but it's still kind
of<00:01:29.440> related

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.160 

now<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.969> start<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.420> next<00:01:36.719> note<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.109> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
now if I start on the next note of the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.200 
now if I start on the next note of the
scale

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
scale

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.340 
scale
I<00:01:40.970> get<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.690> five<00:01:43.350> three<00:01:43.909> five<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> see

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I get this three five three five you see

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
I get this three five three five you see
so<00:01:47.010> what<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.540> gonna

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
solo just using that simple idea and I'm
gonna<00:01:54.180> manipulate<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.080> melody<00:01:55.470> I'll<00:01:55.560> start

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

it here and then I'll start it on

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.719 
it here and then I'll start it on
different<00:01:58.259> notes<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.770> could<00:01:59.070> reverse<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
different notes I could reverse the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
different notes I could reverse the
pattern<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.210> instead<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:02.070> could

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
pattern like instead of going I could

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:55.089 
pattern like instead of going I could
come<00:02:02.610> down<00:02:07.039> okay<00:02:08.069> let's<00:02:08.670> hear<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> track

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.979 

so<00:02:56.099> what<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.340> was<00:02:56.610> doing<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.450> basically

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
so what I was doing there is basically

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.610 
so what I was doing there is basically
taking<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.709> solo<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.959> only<00:03:00.959> working<00:03:01.439> with<00:03:01.560> one

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
taking a solo and only working with one

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350 
taking a solo and only working with one
small<00:03:02.340> melody

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
small melody

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.539 
small melody
okay<00:03:03.689> so<00:03:03.750> again<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.409> was<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.769> 2<00:03:05.190> 4<00:03:05.790> 3<00:03:06.360> 4<00:03:07.310> ok<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
okay so again it was just 2 4 3 4 ok and

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.149 
okay so again it was just 2 4 3 4 ok and
I<00:03:08.940> was<00:03:09.170> manipulating<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> starting<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> on

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
I was manipulating it starting it on

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.369 
I was manipulating it starting it on
different<00:03:11.790> notes<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> scale<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.690> keeping

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
different notes of the scale but keeping

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.250 
different notes of the scale but keeping
the<00:03:13.530> same<00:03:13.890> sort<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.819> motion<00:03:15.060> happening<00:03:16.019> a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the same sort of motion happening a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.140 
the same sort of motion happening a
great<00:03:16.799> way<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.010> practicing<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.819> using

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
great way of practicing is using

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.170 
great way of practicing is using
something<00:03:18.329> called<00:03:18.500> question<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.739> answer<00:03:20.180> so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
something called question and answer so

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.440 
something called question and answer so
the<00:03:21.299> idea<00:03:21.659> with<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.349> basically<00:03:23.450> you're

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
the idea with this is basically you're

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.210 
the idea with this is basically you're
gonna<00:03:24.569> play<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> phrase<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.920> sort<00:03:26.159> of

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
gonna play a phrase and it's sort of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.930 
gonna play a phrase and it's sort of
like<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.629> conversation<00:03:27.629> like<00:03:28.230> one<00:03:28.799> one<00:03:29.459> melody

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
like a conversation like one one melody

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.940 
like a conversation like one one melody
says<00:03:30.359> something<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.079> then<00:03:31.170> another<00:03:31.409> one<00:03:31.650> sort

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
says something and then another one sort

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.190 
says something and then another one sort
of<00:03:32.010> answers<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> I'll<00:03:33.870> give<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.049> an

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
of answers it so I'll give you an

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.110 
of answers it so I'll give you an
example<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.859> what<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.819> kind<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.209> sounds<00:03:36.540> like

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.960 

here's<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.299> original<00:03:42.510> melody

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:57.339 

and<00:03:45.600> then<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.710> answer

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.229 

answer

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:13.780 

question<00:04:08.159> answer

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:48.010 

question<00:04:19.190> answer

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.540 

so<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.140> basic<00:04:49.500> idea<00:04:49.620> here<00:04:49.890> is<00:04:50.190> I'm<00:04:50.370> thinking

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
so the basic idea here is I'm thinking

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.970 
so the basic idea here is I'm thinking
of<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.200> conversation<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.650> know<00:04:52.740> one

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
of it like a conversation you know one

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.440 
of it like a conversation you know one
person<00:04:53.400> says<00:04:53.610> something<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.060> then<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.300> have

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
person says something and then you have

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.040 
person says something and then you have
another<00:04:54.830> answer<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.130> what<00:04:57.090> what's<00:04:57.750> great

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
another answer and what what's great

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.650 
another answer and what what's great
with<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.320> is<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.830> can<00:04:58.980> contrast<00:04:59.880> registers

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
with that is you can contrast registers

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.180 
with that is you can contrast registers
you<00:05:00.930> know<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.290> play<00:05:01.440> something<00:05:01.740> up<00:05:01.980> high

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
you know you can play something up high

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.610 
you know you can play something up high
and<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:02.700> something<00:05:03.120> down<00:05:03.300> low<00:05:03.630> or<00:05:04.200> something

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
and then something down low or something

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320 
and then something down low or something
can<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.830> sort<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.310> slow<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:06.000> then<00:05:06.090> another

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
can be sort of slow and then another

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.240 
can be sort of slow and then another
thing<00:05:06.630> more<00:05:06.840> rhythmic<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.980> just<00:05:08.130> goes

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
thing more rhythmic and it just goes

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.580 
thing more rhythmic and it just goes
back<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.610> forth<00:05:08.850> remember<00:05:09.510> music<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.560> a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
back and forth remember music is a

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.650 
back and forth remember music is a
language<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.580> we<00:05:11.910> want<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.210> learn<00:05:12.360> to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
language and we want to learn to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.600 
language and we want to learn to
communicate<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.830> use<00:05:14.100> all<00:05:14.400> the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
communicate that and use all the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.180 
communicate that and use all the
specific<00:05:15.120> licks<00:05:15.450> like<00:05:15.840> okay<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.680> lick<00:05:16.980> has<00:05:17.160> a

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
specific licks like okay this lick has a

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.190 
specific licks like okay this lick has a
little<00:05:17.430> bit<00:05:17.520> more<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.790> a<00:05:17.880> bluesy<00:05:18.330> flavor<00:05:18.660> let
