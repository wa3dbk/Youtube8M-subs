again<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.380> making<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.710> video<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
again I'm making this video because this

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
again I'm making this video because this
is<00:01:47.460> obviously<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.090> easy<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.540> unlock

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is obviously not an easy way to unlock

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
is obviously not an easy way to unlock
character<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> people<00:01:50.490> profit<00:01:50.729> would

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
character a lot of people profit would

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
character a lot of people profit would
even<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.180> he's<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> game<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> wasn't
