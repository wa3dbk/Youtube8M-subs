00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
on griefing on raider servers who want

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.620 
on griefing on raider servers who want

to protect all of your items from those
pesky<00:00:15.900> griefers<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.160> could<00:00:17.400> also<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.910> used

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
pesky griefers but it could also be used

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.910 
pesky griefers but it could also be used
to<00:00:18.480> show<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> your<00:00:19.140> mates<00:00:19.320> how<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.770> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
to show off to your mates how much you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
to show off to your mates how much you
know<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.160> redstone<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.119> does

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
know about redstone because this does

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.359 
know about redstone because this does
look<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.779> lot<00:00:22.260> more<00:00:22.439> complex<00:00:22.830> than<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.250> actually

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
look a lot more complex than it actually

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.870 
look a lot more complex than it actually
is<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.439> as<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.580> very

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
bun hits it and the walls will pop back

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.319 
bun hits it and the walls will pop back
up<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.239> nothing<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.809> ever<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.410> perfect

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
up as if nothing was ever there perfect

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
up as if nothing was ever there perfect
now<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> specify<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.710> actually

now just to specify you don't actually
have<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.579> chests<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> could

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
have to have chests back there you could

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
have to have chests back there you could
put<00:00:55.079> anything<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.280> could<00:00:56.489> be

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
put anything you want that could be

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
put anything you want that could be
blocks<00:00:56.969> leaves<00:00:57.750> dead<00:00:58.379> bodies<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.190> name<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
blocks leaves dead bodies you name it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
blocks leaves dead bodies you name it
you<00:00:59.879> could<00:01:00.090> put<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> there<00:01:00.570> whatever<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.320> want

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you could put it there whatever you want

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.310 
you could put it there whatever you want
to<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:02.059> but<00:01:03.059> its<00:01:03.239> main<00:01:03.480> selling<00:01:03.690> point<00:01:04.019> isn't

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to do but its main selling point isn't

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
to do but its main selling point isn't
its<00:01:04.439> versatility<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.640> how<00:01:05.880> simple<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
its versatility it is how simple and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
its versatility it is how simple and
easy<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> build<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.430> all

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
easy it is to build it doesn't have all

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.830 
easy it is to build it doesn't have all
the<00:01:08.670> fancy<00:01:08.909> things<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.510> I've<00:01:09.600> seen<00:01:09.780> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the fancy things that I've seen in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
the fancy things that I've seen in
recent<00:01:10.140> designs<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.860> hidden<00:01:11.070> storage<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
recent designs of hidden storage but it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
recent designs of hidden storage but it
works<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> most<00:01:13.320> important

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
works well and that's the most important

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
works well and that's the most important
thing<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.010> without<00:01:14.369> further<00:01:14.670> ado<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.570> take

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
thing so without further ado let's take

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600 
thing so without further ado let's take
a<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> Redstone<00:01:16.950> behind<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.400> thing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
a look at the Redstone behind this thing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
a look at the Redstone behind this thing
so<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.560> module<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.070> as

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
so this here is just one module and as

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.440 
so this here is just one module and as
you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.119> three<00:01:21.420> different

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you can see we have got three different

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.899 
you can see we have got three different
circuits<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.710> green<00:01:23.040> circuit<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.790> our

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
circuits the green circuit which is our

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.700 
circuits the green circuit which is our
double<00:01:24.210> piston<00:01:24.390> extender<00:01:24.930> array<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.530> does

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
double piston extender array which does

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
double piston extender array which does
our<00:01:25.860> second<00:01:26.280> block<00:01:26.490> retraction<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.780> blue

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
our second block retraction and the blue

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
our second block retraction and the blue
circuit<00:01:28.619> which<00:01:29.040> does<00:01:29.280> our<00:01:29.430> first<00:01:29.670> block

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
circuit which does our first block

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
circuit which does our first block
retraction<00:01:30.570> then<00:01:30.930> we've<00:01:31.079> got<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> pink<00:01:31.590> circuit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
retraction then we've got a pink circuit

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
retraction then we've got a pink circuit
now<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> most<00:01:33.570> interesting

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
now this is what is the most interesting

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
now this is what is the most interesting
thing<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
thing about this because if you want to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
thing about this because if you want to
add<00:01:35.759> more<00:01:36.060> blocks<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.479> storage<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
add more blocks of storage then all you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
add more blocks of storage then all you
have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.220> extend<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.090> pink<00:01:39.360> line

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
have to do is extend out this pink line

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
have to do is extend out this pink line
you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> repeat<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> circuit

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you don't have to repeat that circuit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
you don't have to repeat that circuit
which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> probably<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> reason<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
which is probably the reason that I like

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
which is probably the reason that I like
this<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.590> much<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> build

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this so much so if you're going to build

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
this so much so if you're going to build
one<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.780> these<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.100> need

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
one of these this is what you will need

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
one of these this is what you will need
for<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> circuit<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.360> need<00:01:48.600> 25<00:01:49.320> building

what you want to do is go a block up and

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.970 
what you want to do is go a block up and
place<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.300> button<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.290> two<00:02:19.560> blocks<00:02:19.800> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
place a button and then two blocks like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830 
place a button and then two blocks like
this<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.370> piece<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.730> redstone<00:02:20.940> dust<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.629> and

this a piece of redstone dust there and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.589 
this a piece of redstone dust there and
a<00:02:22.080> repeater<00:02:22.410> set<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> three<00:02:23.580> ticks<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.239> so

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
a repeater set it to three ticks like so

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.809 
a repeater set it to three ticks like so
a<00:02:24.810> sticky<00:02:25.470> piston<00:02:25.830> facing<00:02:25.950> upwards<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.790> a

block a block here with a repeater and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.490 
block a block here with a repeater and
then<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.269> will<00:02:30.390> run<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.660> into<00:02:30.870> another<00:02:31.080> block

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
then that will run it into another block

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.259 
then that will run it into another block
then<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.830> want<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> drag<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.400> out<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.910> so

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
then you want to drag this out like so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.210 
then you want to drag this out like so
putting<00:02:33.569> redstone<00:02:34.170> across<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.830> top<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.160> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
into this block here and you'll end up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
into this block here and you'll end up
with<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.019> dual<00:02:52.349> edged<00:02:52.650> monostable<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.489> as<00:02:53.579> you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
with a dual edged monostable so as you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.270 
with a dual edged monostable so as you
can<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:53.849> we<00:02:54.480> get<00:02:54.630> two<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.440> short<00:02:55.799> pulses

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
can see we get two really short pulses

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.490 
can see we get two really short pulses
which<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.640> perfect<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.230> we're<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
which is perfect so now we're going to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.229 
which is perfect so now we're going to
crack<00:02:58.799> on<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.010> our<00:02:59.280> blue<00:02:59.519> circuits<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.120> want

here and then you just want to fill in

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.930 
here and then you just want to fill in
all<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.139> those<00:03:43.410> gaps<00:03:43.620> with<00:03:43.799> repeaters<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.430> set

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
all of those gaps with repeaters and set

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.460 
all of those gaps with repeaters and set
them<00:03:45.060> all<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.540> four<00:03:45.750> ticks<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:49.380> now

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
them all to four ticks like so so now

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.930 
them all to four ticks like so so now
we're<00:03:49.620> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.769> get<00:03:49.889> on<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.340> pink<00:03:50.670> line

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
we're going to get on with the pink line

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.879 
we're going to get on with the pink line
now<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.630> where<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.139> length<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.680> your

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
now this is where the length of your

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.009 
now this is where the length of your
storage<00:03:53.250> comes<00:03:53.819> to<00:03:54.030> hand<00:03:54.269> because<00:03:54.690> I'm<00:03:54.900> just

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
storage comes to hand because I'm just

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.930 
storage comes to hand because I'm just
going<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.290> do<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.530> for<00:03:55.769> four<00:03:55.980> Pistons<00:03:56.489> but

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
going to do this for four Pistons but

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.580 
going to do this for four Pistons but
you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.239> make<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.630> for<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.900> giant<00:03:58.349> wall<00:03:58.560> of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
you can make this for a giant wall of

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.319 
you can make this for a giant wall of
them<00:03:58.889> but<00:03:59.280> anyway<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.849> just<00:03:59.880> want<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.239> go

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
them but anyway you just want to go

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.180 
them but anyway you just want to go
along<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.410> place<00:04:01.709> your<00:04:01.950> redstone

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
along like this and place your redstone

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.910 
along like this and place your redstone
across<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.810> then<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.500> blocks<00:04:04.739> along

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
across like so and then it blocks along

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.890 
across like so and then it blocks along
like<00:04:05.099> that<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.549> repeaters<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.120> set<00:04:06.569> them<00:04:06.690> all

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
like that and repeaters and set them all

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.699 
like that and repeaters and set them all
to<00:04:06.959> four<00:04:07.650> ticks<00:04:07.920> like<00:04:08.669> this<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.410> then<00:04:10.410> you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
to four ticks like this and then you

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.110 
to four ticks like this and then you
just<00:04:10.889> want<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.069> put<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.430> your<00:04:11.459> double<00:04:11.880> piston

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
just want to put in your double piston

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.430 
just want to put in your double piston
extender<00:04:12.419> see<00:04:12.630> when<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> put<00:04:12.989> blocks<00:04:13.169> along

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
extender see when I put blocks along

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.500 
extender see when I put blocks along
like<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.099> then<00:04:14.579> just<00:04:14.790> two<00:04:14.940> Pistons<00:04:15.359> up

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
like this and then just two Pistons up

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.120 
like this and then just two Pistons up
like<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.870> all<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.260> way<00:04:16.380> along<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.979> length

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
like that all the way along the length

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.729 
like that all the way along the length
of<00:04:17.400> your<00:04:17.579> wall<00:04:17.820> until<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.049> complete<00:04:19.560> then

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
of your wall until it is complete then

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.089 
of your wall until it is complete then
take<00:04:19.979> out<00:04:20.160> any<00:04:20.370> unnecessary<00:04:20.729> blocks<00:04:21.800> so<00:04:22.800> then

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
take out any unnecessary blocks so then

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.219 
take out any unnecessary blocks so then
you<00:04:23.250> just<00:04:23.280> want<00:04:23.640> to<00:04:23.700> make<00:04:23.880> another<00:04:24.510> two<00:04:24.930> wide

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
you just want to make another two wide

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.090 
you just want to make another two wide
platform

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
platform

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.770 
platform
this<00:04:26.340> all<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> way<00:04:26.880> along<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.300> length<00:04:27.540> of

this all the way along the length of

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.360 
this all the way along the length of
your<00:04:27.990> wall<00:04:28.200> now<00:04:28.680> this<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.980> where<00:04:29.100> you've<00:04:29.220> got

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
your wall now this is where you've got

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.530 
your wall now this is where you've got
to<00:04:29.490> decide<00:04:29.790> whether<00:04:30.000> you're<00:04:30.180> going<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.420> do

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
to decide whether you're going to do

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.900 
to decide whether you're going to do
redstone<00:04:31.020> lamps<00:04:31.470> or<00:04:31.590> fence<00:04:32.160> gates<00:04:32.490> for<00:04:32.790> your

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
redstone lamps or fence gates for your

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.220 
redstone lamps or fence gates for your
bud<00:04:33.090> activators<00:04:33.690> now<00:04:33.810> I'm<00:04:33.900> going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.080> use

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
bud activators now I'm going to use

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.960 
bud activators now I'm going to use
lamps<00:04:34.530> because<00:04:34.620> they're<00:04:34.860> easier<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.220> place<00:04:35.550> so

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
lamps because they're easier to place so

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.070 
lamps because they're easier to place so
you<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.150> want<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.390> run<00:04:36.540> them<00:04:36.660> along<00:04:36.900> like

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
you just want to run them along like

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.930 
you just want to run them along like
this<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.380> then<00:04:37.980> blocks<00:04:38.280> across<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.730> top<00:04:38.910> of

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
this and then blocks across the top of

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.210 
this and then blocks across the top of
them<00:04:39.240> with<00:04:39.660> repeaters<00:04:40.320> running<00:04:40.770> into<00:04:41.100> those

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
them with repeaters running into those

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.670 
them with repeaters running into those
blocks<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.690> then<00:04:43.290> you<00:04:43.380> just<00:04:43.530> want<00:04:43.650> to

blocks like so and then you just want to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.560 
blocks like so and then you just want to
grab<00:04:43.800> redstone<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.340> link<00:04:44.850> all<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.210> these<00:04:45.390> up

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
grab redstone and link all of these up

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.020 
grab redstone and link all of these up
so<00:04:45.900> as<00:04:46.050> you<00:04:46.230> will<00:04:46.350> see<00:04:46.560> now<00:04:46.590> our<00:04:47.220> double<00:04:47.730> piston

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
so as you will see now our double piston

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.550 
so as you will see now our double piston
extender<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.600> done<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.960> just<00:04:49.140> put<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.410> our

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
extender is done you just put in our

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.890 
extender is done you just put in our
wall<00:04:50.160> blocks<00:04:50.460> like<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:50.850> hit<00:04:51.390> this<00:04:51.510> bun<00:04:51.720> as

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
wall blocks like this hit this bun as

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.810 
wall blocks like this hit this bun as
you<00:04:51.990> can<00:04:52.170> see<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.650> fires<00:04:53.220> out<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.520> block<00:04:53.700> at

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
you can see it fires out the block at

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.790 
you can see it fires out the block at
the<00:04:53.910> top<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.420> then<00:04:54.960> when<00:04:55.080> we<00:04:55.200> press<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.500> again

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the top and then when we press it again

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800 
the top and then when we press it again
it<00:04:56.010> retracts<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.850> back<00:04:57.000> down<00:04:57.240> into<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.570> ground

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
it retracts it back down into the ground

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.050 
it retracts it back down into the ground
and<00:04:58.050> now<00:04:58.830> for<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.130> simplest<00:04:59.550> part<00:04:59.850> of<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
and now for the simplest part of the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.580 
and now for the simplest part of the
build<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.480> first<00:05:00.720> block<00:05:00.990> retraction<00:05:01.500> you

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
build the first block retraction you

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.840 
build the first block retraction you
just<00:05:01.770> want<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:01.920> run<00:05:02.100> these<00:05:02.190> blocks<00:05:02.460> along<00:05:02.700> like

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
just want to run these blocks along like

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.880 
just want to run these blocks along like
this<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.330> then<00:05:03.720> redstone<00:05:04.230> across<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.680> top

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
this and then redstone across the top

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.420 
this and then redstone across the top
like<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
like so

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.430 
like so
grab<00:05:05.970> some<00:05:06.180> sticky<00:05:06.510> pistons<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.020> put<00:05:07.200> them<00:05:07.320> on

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
grab some sticky pistons and put them on

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.680 
grab some sticky pistons and put them on
the<00:05:07.560> side<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:08.100> these<00:05:08.250> blocks<00:05:08.550> here<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:08.940> then

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the side of these blocks here and then

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.050 
the side of these blocks here and then
just<00:05:10.020> your<00:05:10.200> wall<00:05:10.410> blocks<00:05:10.680> along<00:05:11.010> like<00:05:11.190> this<00:05:11.460> so

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
just your wall blocks along like this so

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.520 
just your wall blocks along like this so
now<00:05:12.150> let's<00:05:12.330> give<00:05:12.480> this<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.720> tester<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.230> hit<00:05:13.440> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
now let's give this a tester you hit the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.010 
now let's give this a tester you hit the
bun<00:05:13.710> as<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.130> can<00:05:14.310> see<00:05:14.580> we<00:05:15.120> get<00:05:15.270> ourselves<00:05:15.420> a

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
bun as you can see we get ourselves a

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.500 
bun as you can see we get ourselves a
nice<00:05:16.380> clean<00:05:16.950> wall<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.640> then<00:05:18.090> when<00:05:18.210> we<00:05:18.300> hit<00:05:18.390> the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
nice clean wall and then when we hit the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.840 
nice clean wall and then when we hit the
button<00:05:18.750> again<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.290> all<00:05:19.860> gets<00:05:20.100> retracted<00:05:20.640> down

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
button again it all gets retracted down

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.400 
button again it all gets retracted down
now<00:05:21.060> obviously<00:05:21.420> you<00:05:21.600> will<00:05:21.690> place<00:05:21.930> your<00:05:22.110> chest

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
now obviously you will place your chest

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.230 
now obviously you will place your chest
along<00:05:22.800> these<00:05:23.010> blocks<00:05:23.250> here<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.910> can<00:05:24.060> do<00:05:24.210> all

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
along these blocks here you can do all

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.730 
along these blocks here you can do all
the<00:05:24.540> decoration<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.380> would<00:05:25.530> like<00:05:25.710> to

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
the decoration that you would like to

and by the end you should end up with

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.200 
and by the end you should end up with
something<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.190> looks<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.520> little<00:05:29.700> bit<00:05:29.940> like
