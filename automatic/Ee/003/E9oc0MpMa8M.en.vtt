00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.820
 when it was at 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 I woke up with the police in the house. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.869
 I want to talk to nobody 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.349
 So 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.609
 I saw the cops talking to br is one thing but they said that this can be 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.779
 So they were giving testimony. 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.000
 and that it is important to know that the event 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.949
 of literacy 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.150
 so he went to the police station and my father was a companion of the l was already too 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.399
 no, no 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.419
 I gave my life 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.630
 Did you ever get called? 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.630
 on s after island 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.400
 this morning 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.310
 then no 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.110
 I worried I went to sleep 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.980
 and she came after I woke up with a phone call from milan 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.710
 I got nervous 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.650
 saying that he was passing and killed elisete of goal 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.650
 and that it was for me to put his clothes on 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.880
 want a red blouse in the jeans in the washing machine 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.380
 it's austral 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.500
 - I voted in the marina to know that the girl who does not remember but took 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 measured measure however 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 So you feel very strange. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 I finally could not sleep imputed and it is strange that he had 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.180
 also ordered for such washing clothes 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.550
 and soon after and my father arrived 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.090
 saying that he tells my mother he had confessed the crime 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.520
 And my mother was told to me. 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.110
 have to be made 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.110
 I was a bit like this but the collection would be a lot of people at home 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.860
 many people at home 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.640
 I mean, I wanted to be very intelligent. 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 it's not possible to light it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 must be the truth 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.260
 so she called my childhood colleague 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.680
 very technical and has a renowned track but soon after 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.780
 several people appeared 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.640
 on the hunt to interrogate several people in the building
