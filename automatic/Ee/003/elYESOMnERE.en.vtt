built<00:01:07.650> using<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.700> thought<00:01:09.450> you'd<00:01:09.600> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
built using this and thought you'd like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.060

me<00:01:17.729> after<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> hit<00:01:18.780> seen<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.320> video<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
me after the hit seen the video of the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.870 
me after the hit seen the video of the
hell<00:01:20.670> horse<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> made<00:01:21.600> last<00:01:21.810> year<00:01:22.080> and

thought that their industrial hot knife
would<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:28.020> fit<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> bill<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.280> going

to<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.670> another<00:01:29.880> large<00:01:30.270> project<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
to do another large project like that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.800 
to do another large project like that
and<00:01:31.369> they<00:01:32.369> sent<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.820> complimentary<00:01:33.509> if

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and they sent it to me complimentary if

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.050

works so let's give it a shot and I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.359 
works so let's give it a shot and I
loved<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> six-inch<00:01:44.250> knife

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
loved it but this is a six-inch knife

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.389 
loved it but this is a six-inch knife
that's<00:01:45.090> being<00:01:45.509> used<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.320> cut<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
that's being used to cut out the
hellhound<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> slow<00:01:49.439> going

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
hellhound and it's kind of slow going

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.310 
hellhound and it's kind of slow going
you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.640> make<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.180> faster<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> turn<00:01:52.140> up

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you can make it go faster if you turn up

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
you can make it go faster if you turn up
the<00:01:52.470> heat<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:53.310> you're<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> lot

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the heat but you're going to get a lot

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.709 
the heat but you're going to get a lot
more<00:01:54.210> smoke<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.759> smoke<00:01:57.689> detectors

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
more smoke and I have smoke detectors

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.459 
more smoke and I have smoke detectors
and<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> didn't<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.689> how<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.960> smoke<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and so I didn't know how much smoke I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990 
and so I didn't know how much smoke I
could<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> found<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.340> later<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> can

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
could have I found out later on you can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.069 
could have I found out later on you can
have<00:02:03.240> quite<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> smoke<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:05.659> was<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
have quite a bit of smoke I was going to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
have quite a bit of smoke I was going to
town<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.740> day<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.580> looked<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> there

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
town one day and I looked up and there

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
town one day and I looked up and there
the<00:02:09.509> whole<00:02:09.720> room<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.500> filled<00:02:10.770> with

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the whole room was just filled with

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.460 
the whole room was just filled with
smoke<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> no<00:02:11.879> fire<00:02:11.910> detectors<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:12.900> off<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
smoke and no fire detectors going off so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.760 
smoke and no fire detectors going off so
yay<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.090> shapeable<00:02:18.810> round<00:02:19.380> blade<00:02:20.240> was

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
yay the shapeable round blade was

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.700 
yay the shapeable round blade was
terrific<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:23.070> use<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:24.330> sculpt<00:02:25.020> out<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
terrific to use to sculpt out the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.880 
terrific to use to sculpt out the
hellhound<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.640> put<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.600> into<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.990> rectangular

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
hellhound I put it into this rectangular

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.370 
hellhound I put it into this rectangular
shape<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.580> allowed<00:02:29.850> me<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.120> make<00:02:30.660> pull

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
shape and that allowed me to make pull

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.810 
shape and that allowed me to make pull
away<00:02:31.530> strips<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> foam<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:34.490> you<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.670> be

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
away strips of the foam and you can be

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.970 
away strips of the foam and you can be
so<00:02:36.090> much<00:02:36.240> more<00:02:36.300> creative<00:02:36.860> burning<00:02:37.860> away

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
so much more creative burning away

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.820 
so much more creative burning away
strips<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.670> foam<00:02:38.820> than<00:02:39.360> hacking<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> away<00:02:40.590> with

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
strips of foam than hacking it away with

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.180 
strips of foam than hacking it away with
the<00:02:40.920> drywall<00:02:41.220> cutter<00:02:42.380> because<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.980> don't

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
the drywall cutter because you don't

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.730 
the drywall cutter because you don't
have<00:02:44.340> half<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.060> snow<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:46.230> over<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
have half of that snow all over the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.430 
have half of that snow all over the
place<00:02:47.570> actually<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.660> don't<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.960> much<00:02:49.170> snow

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
place actually you don't have much snow

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.580 
place actually you don't have much snow
at<00:02:49.620> all<00:02:49.740> but<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.150> what<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.930> call<00:02:52.260> snow

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
at all but you do have what I call snow

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
at all but you do have what I call snow
crystals<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.370> let's<00:02:53.580> switch<00:02:53.670> over<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
crystals so let's switch over to that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
crystals so let's switch over to that
and<00:02:54.390> I'll<00:02:54.660> show<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:56.570> these<00:02:57.570> snow<00:02:57.810> crystals

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and I'll show you these snow crystals

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.850 
and I'll show you these snow crystals
are<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.770> tiny<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.160> bits<00:02:59.790> of<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.860> burnt

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
are just tiny little bits of the burnt

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.150 
are just tiny little bits of the burnt
plastic<00:03:02.070> or<00:03:02.760> foam<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.840> whatever<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.590> it's

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
plastic or foam or whatever that is it's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.420 
plastic or foam or whatever that is it's
not<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.610> much<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.090> nuisance<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:07.430> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
not that much of a nuisance that that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.830 
not that much of a nuisance that that
was<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.730> amount<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> crystals<00:03:09.390> generated

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
was the amount of crystals generated

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.700 
was the amount of crystals generated
from<00:03:09.960> that<00:03:10.260> much<00:03:10.500> strips<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.950> foam<00:03:12.710> here's

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
from that much strips of foam here's

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.690 
from that much strips of foam here's
some<00:03:14.040> time<00:03:14.340> lapse<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:15.150> show<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.130> how<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.190> can

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
some time lapse to show you how you can

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.590 
some time lapse to show you how you can
just<00:03:17.940> start<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.660> town<00:03:18.900> carving<00:03:19.739> things

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
just start going to town carving things

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.090 
just start going to town carving things
I'll<00:03:21.600> tell<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.170> industrial<00:03:22.530> hot<00:03:22.890> knife

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
I'll tell you this industrial hot knife

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.150 
I'll tell you this industrial hot knife
I<00:03:24.200> couldn't<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.350> done<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.770> hellhound

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
I couldn't have done the hellhound

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.530 
I couldn't have done the hellhound
without<00:03:26.520> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.350 

one<00:03:30.200> aspect<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.580> blades<00:03:31.819> that<00:03:31.939> I<00:03:32.030> didn't

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
one aspect of the blades that I didn't

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.110 
one aspect of the blades that I didn't
expect<00:03:32.780> was<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.409> value<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:34.099> cutting<00:03:34.549> really

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
expect was the value of cutting really

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.890 
expect was the value of cutting really
thin<00:03:35.480> slices<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.260> foam<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.939> needed<00:03:38.659> a<00:03:38.720> lot

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
thin slices of foam and I needed a lot

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
thin slices of foam and I needed a lot
of<00:03:39.019> scales<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.739> hellhound<00:03:40.189> and<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.000> I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
of scales for that hellhound and so I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.059 
of scales for that hellhound and so I
was<00:03:41.269> able<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.599> just<00:03:41.930> cut<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.590> cut<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:42.860> cut

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
was able to just cut and cut and cut

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.089 
was able to just cut and cut and cut
scales<00:03:43.730> would<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.299> taken<00:03:44.510> me<00:03:44.810> forever<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.950> do

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
scales would have taken me forever to do

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.899 
scales would have taken me forever to do
it<00:03:46.220> any<00:03:46.370> other<00:03:46.489> way

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
it any other way

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.520 
it any other way
so<00:03:47.780> yeh<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:49.549> other<00:03:49.730> thing<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.299> is<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:51.079> texture

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
so yeh the other thing is is the texture

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.210 
so yeh the other thing is is the texture
that<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:52.010> left<00:03:52.340> behind<00:03:52.959> was<00:03:53.959> perfect<00:03:54.620> for<00:03:55.159> what

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
that it left behind was perfect for what

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.530 
that it left behind was perfect for what
I<00:03:55.430> thought<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.299> scale<00:03:56.720> would<00:03:56.989> look<00:03:57.260> like<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.540> so

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
I thought a scale would look like and so

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
I thought a scale would look like and so
I'm<00:03:59.840> going<00:04:00.019> to<00:04:00.109> peel<00:04:00.439> this<00:04:00.590> apart<00:04:00.950> here<00:04:01.129> in<00:04:01.220> a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
I'm going to peel this apart here in a

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.520 
I'm going to peel this apart here in a
second<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.120> see<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:03.170> leaves<00:04:03.290> like

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
second and you can see it leaves like

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.050 
second and you can see it leaves like
little<00:04:03.890> bits<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:05.079> melted<00:04:06.079> plastic<00:04:06.909> but<00:04:07.909> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
little bits of melted plastic but the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.300 
little bits of melted plastic but the
texture<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.659> me<00:04:08.840> reminded<00:04:09.620> me<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:09.769> what<00:04:10.069> a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
texture to me reminded me of what a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.460 
texture to me reminded me of what a
scale<00:04:10.849> would<00:04:11.209> have<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.810> it

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.890 

here's<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.070> good<00:04:17.700> video<00:04:17.910> bit<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.480> show<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
here's a good video bit to show you the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.490 
here's a good video bit to show you the
versatility<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.010> hot<00:04:20.190> knife<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.959> back

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
versatility of the hot knife the back

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.050 
versatility of the hot knife the back
spines<00:04:22.980> for<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> hellhound<00:04:23.730> was<00:04:23.940> an

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.110 
spines for the hellhound was an
incredible<00:04:24.630> challenge<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.730> allowed

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
incredible challenge and so it allowed

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.140 
incredible challenge and so it allowed
me<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.390> just<00:04:27.720> kind<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.080> carve<00:04:28.440> away<00:04:29.060> kind<00:04:30.060> of

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
me to just kind of carve away kind of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.450 
me to just kind of carve away kind of
like<00:04:30.210> whittling<00:04:30.780> wood<00:04:31.190> because<00:04:32.190> each<00:04:32.400> of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
like whittling wood because each of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:41.950 
like whittling wood because each of
these<00:04:32.790> scales<00:04:33.090> had<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.570> be<00:04:33.690> made<00:04:34.190> individually

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.010 

and<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.949> a<00:04:43.070> pinch<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.389> hot<00:04:44.570> knife<00:04:44.780> also

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
and in a pinch that the hot knife also

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.260 
and in a pinch that the hot knife also
is<00:04:45.259> good<00:04:45.470> for<00:04:45.500> detail<00:04:46.070> work<00:04:46.400> because<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.060> needed
