00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.039 
six sections just three on each side
this<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.610> makes<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> easier<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.570> me<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this just makes it easier for me to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.130 
this just makes it easier for me to
apply<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.740> color<00:01:56.280> evenly<00:01:56.969> after<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.930> I'm

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
apply the color evenly after that I'm

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770 
apply the color evenly after that I'm
using<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> Vaseline<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.479> around

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
using the Vaseline and I go all around

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
using the Vaseline and I go all around
my<00:02:01.140> hairline<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
my hairline this is just going to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.209 
my hairline this is just going to
protect<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.119> skin<00:02:03.450> from<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.140> hair<00:02:04.469> color<00:02:04.799> so

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
protect your skin from the hair color so

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
protect your skin from the hair color so
not<00:02:05.880> necessarily<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.810> buns<00:02:07.020> or

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
not necessarily because it buns or

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869 
not necessarily because it buns or
anything<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:08.009> least<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.399> me<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
anything like that at least to me it

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.570 
anything like that at least to me it
doesn't<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.440> stay<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.830> your<00:02:10.920> skin<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
doesn't but it will stay in your skin so

with Vaseline
your<00:02:12.970> skin<00:02:13.300> that<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:13.900> makes<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.380> super<00:02:14.710> easy

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to just wipe it right off next you want

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.930

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
to mix your dye so you open the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.750 
to mix your dye so you open the
developing<00:02:19.570> cream<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.740> pour<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.550> the

dye and the developing bottle and give
it<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.760> really<00:02:25.210> good<00:02:25.390> shape<00:02:25.690> because<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.080> use<00:02:26.290> two

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it a really good shape because I use two

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.130 
it a really good shape because I use two
boxes<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.190> cover<00:02:27.400> all<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.090> hair<00:02:28.360> then<00:02:28.900> this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
boxes to cover all of my hair then this

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
boxes to cover all of my hair then this
is<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.380> time<00:02:29.590> where<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.830> actually<00:02:30.040> mix<00:02:30.580> both<00:02:30.910> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
is the time where I actually mix both of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.060 
is the time where I actually mix both of
them<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.690> them<00:02:31.960> prepped<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.560> ready<00:02:32.620> I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
them to have them prepped and ready I

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.250 
them to have them prepped and ready I
like<00:02:33.460> starting<00:02:34.030> at<00:02:34.120> my<00:02:34.270> root<00:02:34.570> even<00:02:35.080> though<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
like starting at my root even though you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.080 
like starting at my root even though you
can<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.560> here<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.400> natural<00:02:36.760> hair<00:02:36.850> color

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
can see here that my natural hair color

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.960 
can see here that my natural hair color
is<00:02:37.330> black<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.020> I've<00:02:38.380> got<00:02:38.650> like<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.100> good<00:02:39.670> inch

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
is black and I've got like a good inch

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.340 
is black and I've got like a good inch
or<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.660> hair<00:02:40.870> growth

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
or so of hair growth

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.470 
or so of hair growth
I'm<00:02:41.410> starting<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:42.460> anyway<00:02:42.970> because<00:02:43.210> this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
I'm starting there anyway because this

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
I'm starting there anyway because this
is<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:43.840> easier<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.290> me<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.650> apply<00:02:45.160> all<00:02:45.910> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
is just easier for me to apply all of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.630 
is just easier for me to apply all of
the<00:02:46.330> dye<00:02:46.480> evenly<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:47.860> using<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> tip

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the dye evenly then I like using the tip

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360 
the dye evenly then I like using the tip
of<00:02:48.670> my<00:02:48.880> eyebrows<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.780> actually<00:02:50.260> divide<00:02:50.920> my

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
of my eyebrows to actually divide my

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.270 
of my eyebrows to actually divide my
hair<00:02:51.400> into<00:02:51.700> smaller<00:02:52.420> sections<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.410> keep

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
hair into smaller sections and keep

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.520 
hair into smaller sections and keep
applying<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.880> dye<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.330> I'm<00:02:55.840> basically<00:02:56.380> just

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
applying the dye and I'm basically just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.130 
applying the dye and I'm basically just
repeating<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.520> same<00:02:57.790> step<00:02:58.090> once<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:58.690> fully

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
repeating that same step once I fully

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.680 
repeating that same step once I fully
covered<00:02:59.680> all<00:02:59.860> of<00:03:00.220> my<00:03:00.370> root<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.360> start

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
covered all of my root then I start

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.620 
covered all of my root then I start
working<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.350> dye<00:03:02.530> all<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.760> way<00:03:03.880> down<00:03:04.120> my<00:03:04.330> hair

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
working the dye all the way down my hair

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.110 
working the dye all the way down my hair
to<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.230> end<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.860> very<00:03:06.220> generous<00:03:06.730> with<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
to the end and very generous with the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
to the end and very generous with the
amount<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.540> dye<00:03:07.720> I'm<00:03:07.930> playing<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.380> my<00:03:08.500> hair<00:03:08.770> I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
amount of dye I'm playing in my hair I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.670 
amount of dye I'm playing in my hair I
like<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.490> make<00:03:09.790> sure<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:10.270> my<00:03:10.420> hair<00:03:10.450> is

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
like to make sure that my hair is

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.310 
like to make sure that my hair is
saturated<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.240> two<00:03:13.480> boxes<00:03:13.690> so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
saturated in it and I have two boxes so

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.010 
saturated in it and I have two boxes so
I<00:03:14.350> know<00:03:14.680> I'm<00:03:15.310> gonna<00:03:15.430> get<00:03:15.640> full<00:03:15.940> coverage<00:03:16.210> now

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
I know I'm gonna get full coverage now

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.070 
I know I'm gonna get full coverage now
this<00:03:17.350> dye<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:18.010> ammonia<00:03:18.610> free<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.300> don't<00:03:19.810> feel

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
this dye is ammonia free so I don't feel

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200 
this dye is ammonia free so I don't feel
like<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.440> has<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> really<00:03:20.860> strong<00:03:21.220> scent<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.180> it

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
like it has a really strong scent to it

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:37.210 
like it has a really strong scent to it
or<00:03:22.570> anything<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.110> that

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.640 

so<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> usually<00:03:38.610> leave<00:03:39.210> dye<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.750> my<00:03:39.870> hair<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:40.440> 45

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
so I usually leave dye in my hair for 45

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.040 
so I usually leave dye in my hair for 45
minutes<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.400> an<00:03:41.490> hour<00:03:41.640> just<00:03:42.540> because<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.840> know

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
minutes to an hour just because I know

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.140 
minutes to an hour just because I know
my<00:03:43.590> hair<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:43.830> stubborn<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
my hair is stubborn and this is the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.300 
my hair is stubborn and this is the
amount<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.480> time<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.080> usually<00:03:46.770> have<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.130> leave

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
amount of time I usually have to leave

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.610

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
it in my hair for to make sure that my
hair<00:03:49.650> takes<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.580> dye<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.180> when<00:03:51.300> time<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.750> up

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
hair takes the dye so when time is up

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.990 
hair takes the dye so when time is up
you<00:03:52.170> just<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.650> rinse<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.310> until<00:03:53.820> the

say<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:47.010> though<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.670> couple<00:04:48.300> days<00:04:48.810> after<00:04:49.410> I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440

dyed<00:04:49.680> my<00:04:49.710> hair<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.370> think<00:04:50.670> it's<00:04:50.820> because<00:04:51.240> my

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
dyed my hair I think it's because my

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.020 
dyed my hair I think it's because my
hair<00:04:51.780> was<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.410> light<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.920> had<00:04:53.220> sections<00:04:53.880> that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
hair was so light I had sections that

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.020 
hair was so light I had sections that
were<00:04:54.150> almost<00:04:54.360> platinum<00:04:54.960> blonde<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:56.220> started<00:04:56.880> to

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.930 
were almost platinum blonde I started to
see<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:58.140> highlights<00:04:58.560> peaking<00:04:59.100> out<00:04:59.310> again<00:04:59.730> and

see the highlights peaking out again and

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.970 
see the highlights peaking out again and
I<00:05:00.570> know<00:05:00.630> it's<00:05:00.960> very<00:05:01.230> tough<00:05:01.590> when<00:05:01.860> you're

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
I know it's very tough when you're

go<00:05:03.810> back<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.500> dark<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.400> don't<00:05:05.610> know<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:05.820> me<00:05:06.030> in

really didn't like that at all so what I

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.790 
really didn't like that at all so what I
decided<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.640> do<00:05:11.880> is<00:05:12.300> add<00:05:12.810> some<00:05:12.870> leftover<00:05:13.500> Manic

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
you don't have to mix it with anything

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.760 
you don't have to mix it with anything
you<00:05:20.940> can<00:05:21.150> just<00:05:21.360> apply<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:22.020> your<00:05:22.140> hair<00:05:22.200> just

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
black hair color is violet so I decided

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.060 
black hair color is violet so I decided

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
out especially at the end so I just

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.010 
out especially at the end so I just
added<00:05:37.710> this<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.130> ends<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.490> my<00:05:38.640> hair<00:05:38.670> so<00:05:39.180> in

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
it's not a permanent color so it will

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.010
