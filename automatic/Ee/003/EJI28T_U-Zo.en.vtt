00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
going on long trips even like an hour

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.190 
going on long trips even like an hour
it's<00:00:11.610> too<00:00:11.940> long<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.420> me<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:12.780> being<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
it's too long for me because being in a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's too long for me because being in a
car<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> boring<00:00:14.070> but<00:00:14.429> here<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.880> my<00:00:15.000> ideas<00:00:15.299> now

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
car is boring but here are my ideas now

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.330 
car is boring but here are my ideas now
the<00:00:15.960> most<00:00:16.109> obvious<00:00:16.260> idea<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> play

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the most obvious idea is to play

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
the most obvious idea is to play
something<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.789> your<00:00:17.910> iPhone<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.539> pad<00:00:18.840> or

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
something on your iPhone and your pad or

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410 
something on your iPhone and your pad or
your<00:00:19.430> device<00:00:20.430> whatever<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.910> happen<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
your device whatever you happen to have

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
your device whatever you happen to have
but<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.439> won't<00:00:22.560> work<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> long<00:00:23.130> trip

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
but that won't work on a long trip

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.439 
but that won't work on a long trip
because<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.000> run<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.420> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
because you're going to run out of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
because you're going to run out of
battery<00:00:24.689> unless<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.650> car<00:00:25.830> has<00:00:26.070> something

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
battery unless your car has something

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849 
battery unless your car has something
that<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.760> plug<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> into<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.869> let's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that you can plug it into but let's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
that you can plug it into but let's
assume<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.369> doesn't<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
assume that it doesn't so I'm going to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.420 
assume that it doesn't so I'm going to
skip<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.560> ideas<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.399> with

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
skip all ideas that have to do with

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
skip all ideas that have to do with
electronics<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.930> old-school<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
electronics and just get old-school you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560 
electronics and just get old-school you
can<00:00:35.100> play<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> alphabet<00:00:35.670> game<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.180> play<00:00:36.420> by

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
can play the alphabet game you play by

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
can play the alphabet game you play by
yourself<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.079> play<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.469> others<00:00:37.739> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
yourself you can play with others but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
yourself you can play with others but
the<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.399> works<00:00:38.760> never<00:00:39.239> played

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the way that it works never played

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
the way that it works never played
before<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.649> looking<00:00:40.980> around<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.460> at

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
before if you're looking around you at

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
before if you're looking around you at
signs<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> road<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
signs on the road and when you see a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610 
signs on the road and when you see a
sign<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.940> letter<00:00:45.270> A<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
sign that has a letter A in one of the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
sign that has a letter A in one of the
words<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.390> make<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> mental<00:00:48.629> note<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
words and you make a mental note of the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
words and you make a mental note of the
number<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> B<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
number a and then there's a B in the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
number a and then there's a B in the
next<00:00:51.180> slide<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.870> okay<00:00:52.110> B<00:00:52.260> okay<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.100> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
next slide it's okay B okay and then in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.819 
next slide it's okay B okay and then in
that<00:00:53.370> same<00:00:53.579> sign<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.090> also<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.390> C<00:00:54.780> D<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that same sign there's also a C D and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.369 
that same sign there's also a C D and
then<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.070> E<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.699> an<00:00:56.789> F<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.539> whoever<00:00:58.050> gets

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
then an E and then an F so whoever gets

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.569 
then an E and then an F so whoever gets
to<00:00:58.859> Z<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.820> wins<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.949> people<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.399> probably

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
to Z first wins now people will probably

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
to Z first wins now people will probably
ask<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.210> where<00:01:03.420> did<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> Q<00:01:04.260> where

making them up yourselves you have to
have<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.580> guess<00:02:49.670> 24<00:02:50.390> different<00:02:50.660> things<00:02:50.810> as<00:02:51.020> the

have I guess 24 different things as the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660 
have I guess 24 different things as the
middle<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.410> always<00:02:51.650> free<00:02:51.980> space<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.490> don't<00:02:52.610> know

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
middle is always free space I don't know

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.550 
middle is always free space I don't know
why<00:02:52.790> they<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.210> way<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.320> middle

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
why they do it that way but the middle

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.140 
why they do it that way but the middle
of<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.740> middle<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> free<00:02:55.370> space<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:55.880> yeah

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
of the middle is a free space so yeah

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.610 
of the middle is a free space so yeah
then<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.450> fill<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.750> other<00:02:56.840> 24<00:02:57.380> things
