00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.360 
through affecting the eardrum it's it's
it's<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> individual<00:00:25.710> perception<00:00:26.280> I

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
it's all up to individual perception I

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.100 
it's all up to individual perception I
think<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.790> look<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.120> the<00:00:27.270> objective

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
think if we look at the objective

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.450 
think if we look at the objective
perception<00:00:28.770> would<00:00:29.310> always<00:00:29.580> change<00:00:30.120> with<00:00:31.050> our

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
perception would always change with our

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
perception would always change with our
involvement<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:33.050> perception<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.260> does

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
involvement in that perception so does

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.020 
involvement in that perception so does
that<00:00:34.379> mean<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.800> mood<00:00:35.010> makes<00:00:35.519> it<00:00:35.670> obviously

that mean your mood makes it obviously

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819 
that mean your mood makes it obviously

all the synthesis who knows man I mean I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
all the synthesis who knows man I mean I
think<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.640> basically<00:01:21.890> art<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:24.350> for<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
think that basically art is for the

think that basically art is for the
listener<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:27.060> mean<00:01:27.329> people<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:27.899> idea

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.399 
listener and I mean people have an idea
I<00:01:28.649> think<00:01:29.130> ideas<00:01:29.549> become<00:01:29.880> very<00:01:30.119> popular<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
I think ideas become very popular and so

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
I think ideas become very popular and so
right<00:01:31.590> now<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> idea<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.399> no<00:01:32.670> production<00:01:33.149> is

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
right now the idea of no production is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380 
right now the idea of no production is
very<00:01:33.299> popular<00:01:34.020> apparently<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:36.180> never

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
very popular apparently so we're never

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
very popular apparently so we're never
trying<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.899> anything<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.439> cool<00:01:37.680> or

figure<00:02:38.070> out<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.880> revolution

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
figure out and I think the revolution

figure out and I think the revolution
starts<00:02:39.720> inside<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.470> once<00:02:41.040> once<00:02:41.490> people

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
starts inside and once once people

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.790 
starts inside and once once people
understand<00:02:42.570> where<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.050> money<00:02:43.230> goes<00:02:43.320> when<00:02:43.740> you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
understand where the money goes when you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.590 
understand where the money goes when you
buy<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> record<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.490> iTunes<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.360> buy<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
when you steal a record I think that the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
more people understand the process the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.600 
more people understand the process the
more<00:02:49.800> they're<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:49.980> want<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.340> steal<00:02:50.580> it

understand that once people become

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500 
understand that once people become
educated<00:03:47.070> about<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.150> won't<00:03:48.330> happen

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
educated about it then it won't happen

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.330 
educated about it then it won't happen
anymore<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.709> that'll<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.190> good

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
writing in the last ten years I mean I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.090 
writing in the last ten years I mean I
think<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.229> people<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.650> write<00:04:20.859> record

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
think the people that write record

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.210 
think the people that write record
reviews<00:04:21.579> aren't<00:04:21.789> even<00:04:22.030> writers<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:23.220> think

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
reviews aren't even writers so I think

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.029 
reviews aren't even writers so I think
we<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.270> have<00:04:25.419> sometimes<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:26.169> like<00:04:26.410> we<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.740> a

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
we do have sometimes it's like we have a

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.950 
we do have sometimes it's like we have a
little<00:04:27.370> bit<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.610> pressure<00:04:28.120> around<00:04:28.270> necks<00:04:28.660> from

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
little bit of pressure around necks from

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.409 
little bit of pressure around necks from
companies<00:04:29.949> as<00:04:30.130> well<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.180> write

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
companies as well so if I write

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.210 
companies as well so if I write
something<00:04:31.449> that's<00:04:31.780> maybe<00:04:32.380> not<00:04:32.500> scathing<00:04:33.070> but

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
something that's maybe not scathing but

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.770 
something that's maybe not scathing but
I<00:04:33.250> don't<00:04:33.580> fucking<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.090> record

more<00:05:08.830> during<00:05:09.099> tour<00:05:09.310> rather<00:05:09.699> than<00:05:10.000> studio<00:05:10.330> a

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
more during tour rather than studio a

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.110 
more during tour rather than studio a
little<00:05:11.889> bit<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.070> both<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.490> different<00:05:12.849> it's

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
little bit of both it's a different it's

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.029 
little bit of both it's a different it's
a<00:05:13.240> different<00:05:13.270> approach<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:14.320> that<00:05:14.560> connection

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
a different approach to that connection

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.129 
a different approach to that connection
of<00:05:15.310> emotion<00:05:15.849> and<00:05:16.180> when<00:05:16.449> we're<00:05:16.659> writing<00:05:16.900> in<00:05:17.050> the

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
of emotion and when we're writing in the

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.770 
of emotion and when we're writing in the
studio<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.620> get<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.889> kind<00:05:18.099> of<00:05:18.159> focus<00:05:19.120> in<00:05:19.509> more

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
studio we get to kind of focus in more

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.570 
studio we get to kind of focus in more
on<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.650> more<00:05:21.430> kind<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.120> maybe<00:05:22.449> contrived

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
on a more kind of maybe contrived

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.460 
on a more kind of maybe contrived
emotion<00:05:24.580> contrived<00:05:25.389> in<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.840> sense<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.169> built

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
emotion contrived in the sense of built

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.469 
emotion contrived in the sense of built
and<00:05:26.830> like<00:05:27.099> established<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.210> really

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
and like established and really

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:28.980 
and like established and really
thought-out

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
thought-out

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.189 
thought-out
not<00:05:29.590> contrived<00:05:30.039> as<00:05:30.220> in<00:05:30.400> over<00:05:30.669> you<00:05:31.389> know<00:05:31.509> but<00:05:32.020> um

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
not contrived as in over you know but um

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.770 
not contrived as in over you know but um
I<00:05:32.500> think<00:05:32.919> live<00:05:33.280> it's<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.639> very<00:05:33.849> natural<00:05:34.120> it

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
I think live it's a very natural it

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.300 
I think live it's a very natural it
comes<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.289> you<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:35.470> that's<00:05:35.800> what<00:05:36.039> you<00:05:36.130> feel

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
comes to you and that's what you feel

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.510 
comes to you and that's what you feel
and<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:36.639> move<00:05:36.849> in<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.389> emotion<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.220> it's<00:05:39.220> two

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
and you move in that emotion so it's two

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.649 
and you move in that emotion so it's two
different<00:05:39.669> worlds<00:05:39.909> I<00:05:40.180> guess<00:05:40.300> it's<00:05:40.449> kind<00:05:40.630> of

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
different worlds I guess it's kind of

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.409 
different worlds I guess it's kind of
like<00:05:40.860> trying<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.039> pick<00:05:42.250> apart<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:43.060> difference

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
like trying to pick apart the difference

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.260 
like trying to pick apart the difference
between<00:05:43.599> a<00:05:43.840> big<00:05:44.099> festival<00:05:45.099> show<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.000> small

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
between a big festival show and a small

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.029 
between a big festival show and a small
intimate<00:05:46.690> show<00:05:46.900> they're<00:05:47.080> both<00:05:47.259> amazing<00:05:47.560> but

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
intimate show they're both amazing but

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.180 
intimate show they're both amazing but
it's<00:05:48.159> just<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:48.460> completely<00:05:49.120> different<00:05:49.210> world

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
it's just a completely different world

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.110 
it's just a completely different world
you<00:05:51.539> kind<00:05:52.539> of<00:05:52.659> do<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.840> just<00:05:53.139> as<00:05:53.889> well<00:05:54.070> I<00:05:54.430> think

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
you kind of do a just as well I think

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.969 
you kind of do a just as well I think
regionally<00:05:55.719> as<00:05:56.289> you<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.530> know<00:05:56.800> if<00:05:56.889> you're

you're<00:06:07.379> pushing<00:06:07.680> off<00:06:07.800> something<00:06:08.009> rather<00:06:08.280> than

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
you're pushing off something rather than

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.860 
you're pushing off something rather than
like<00:06:08.699> playing<00:06:08.970> out<00:06:09.180> to<00:06:09.389> like<00:06:09.569> you<00:06:09.780> know

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
how that like sets adds to my bulge of

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.340 
how that like sets adds to my bulge of
feeling<00:07:07.220> good<00:07:07.400> about<00:07:07.660> playing<00:07:08.660> music<00:07:08.930> it

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
feeling good about playing music it

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.050 
feeling good about playing music it
doesn't<00:07:09.830> really<00:07:10.280> I<00:07:10.310> mean<00:07:10.550> after<00:07:10.820> all<00:07:10.940> this

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
doesn't really I mean after all this

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.630 
doesn't really I mean after all this
time<00:07:11.240> I'm<00:07:11.450> just<00:07:11.660> I<00:07:11.930> just<00:07:12.620> think<00:07:12.950> it's<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.250> same

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
time I'm just I just think it's the same

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.540 
time I'm just I just think it's the same
thing<00:07:13.880> we're<00:07:14.300> trying<00:07:14.450> to<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:15.190> think<00:07:16.190> that

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
thing we're trying to I think that

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.460 
thing we're trying to I think that
setting<00:07:17.000> things<00:07:17.180> apart<00:07:17.600> and<00:07:17.840> kind<00:07:18.110> of<00:07:18.200> setting

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
setting things apart and kind of setting

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.860 
setting things apart and kind of setting
up<00:07:18.560> festivals<00:07:19.100> that<00:07:19.310> include<00:07:20.030> this<00:07:20.390> genre

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
up festivals that include this genre

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.190 
up festivals that include this genre
this<00:07:21.020> genre<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:21.830> mean<00:07:22.370> with<00:07:23.120> with<00:07:23.420> a<00:07:23.450> belief<00:07:23.840> or

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
this genre I mean with with a belief or

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.990 
this genre I mean with with a belief or
with<00:07:24.350> a<00:07:24.380> with<00:07:24.710> a<00:07:24.740> category<00:07:25.610> we<00:07:25.970> have

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
with a with a category we have

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.760 
with a with a category we have
separatism<00:07:26.840> and<00:07:27.230> so<00:07:27.350> that's<00:07:27.560> what<00:07:27.650> we're

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
separatism and so that's what we're

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.380 
separatism and so that's what we're
trying<00:07:27.920> to<00:07:28.070> avoid<00:07:28.370> at<00:07:28.550> all<00:07:28.610> costs<00:07:29.150> I<00:07:29.240> don't

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
trying to avoid at all costs I don't

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.000 
trying to avoid at all costs I don't
think<00:07:29.540> that<00:07:29.720> this<00:07:29.900> should<00:07:30.200> be<00:07:30.230> a<00:07:30.380> competition

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 
think that this should be a competition

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.120 
think that this should be a competition
or<00:07:31.670> I<00:07:31.910> mean<00:07:32.360> music<00:07:32.480> and<00:07:32.840> is<00:07:32.900> a<00:07:33.170> is<00:07:33.560> a<00:07:33.590> personal

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.130 
or I mean music and is a is a personal

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.100 
or I mean music and is a is a personal
expression<00:07:34.460> art<00:07:34.940> is<00:07:35.090> a<00:07:35.120> personal<00:07:35.570> expression

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
expression art is a personal expression

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.740 
expression art is a personal expression
so<00:07:36.410> if<00:07:37.070> we're<00:07:37.580> here<00:07:37.820> to<00:07:38.000> jerk<00:07:38.240> off<00:07:38.420> over

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
so if we're here to jerk off over

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.120 
so if we're here to jerk off over
ourselves<00:07:38.900> then<00:07:39.380> we<00:07:39.470> should<00:07:39.620> probably<00:07:39.860> go

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.130 
ourselves then we should probably go

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:46.360 
ourselves then we should probably go
home<00:07:44.380> to<00:07:45.380> have<00:07:45.470> you<00:07:45.560> guys<00:07:45.680> back<00:07:45.920> here<00:07:45.980> again
