00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.629
 discovery considered by many to be the most 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.280
 chic is the most elegant of the land rover 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.959
 now it is no longer just a model but it is one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 family has a younger sister la 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.920
 equally chic and discovery sport 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.960
 likewise versatile the discovery sport 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 is not only the younger sister of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.339
 discovery but will also replace the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 freelander a nice jump in high respect 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.679
 freelander is the usual excellent exercise 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 of style of germ glover the responsible 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.880
 of the land rover design who makes the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 discovery sport from worthy younger sister 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.750
 also of the range rover compared to the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.930
 freelander the dimensions lie 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.450
 only 10 cm long but presence 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.520
 on the road and habitability the high jump 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.740
 they do it with a beautiful and elegant rod 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.080
 as a range but also spacious e 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.120
 versatile as a discovery space 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.740
 internal is run in the rover style and ed range 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.870
 it is a parade ground with the trunk 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.150
 so large that it can also accommodate 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 a third row of seats and is versatile 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.520
 with the rear sofa flowing x 16 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.799

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.299
 merit also of the mileage step 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.280
 of the new rear suspension 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.280
 super compact multilink 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.479
 one is reduced but ready to overcome 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.340
 which other 60 centimeters and try 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.340
 on off-road routes on average 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 challenging thanks size 434 all 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 terrain response 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.190
 all-wheel drive is available 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.840
 also active drive line traction which 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.550
 physically disconnects the whole 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.470
 rear wheel drive from the hardware 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.140
 transmission to the two pressures that ai 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.340
 sides of the rear differential 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.970
 arrange to distribute the pair between 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.500
 the two wheels 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.080
 I tried it on a mountain road 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.790
 snow covered with a wet snow that it made 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.160
 difficult even one job 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.679
 snowmobile and the drive took me up 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.750
 from the choice slopes this rare 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.550
 heard the discovery discovery show his 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 predisposition to comfort than sport 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.530
 it is soft silent comfortable even if yes 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.510
 travel fast on a dirt road we are 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.400
 Interism meanwhile increase in roll 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.220
 curve but pitching acceleration 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.350
 braking that makes driving less clean and 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.300
 increases the bend reactions if you accelerate 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.400
 with understeer that widens the curve 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.400
 so it brakes with the oversteer that closes 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.380
 the form with the tail because it means 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.880
 dirty but sporting driving directions 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.880
 however, they are also available 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.100
 magneride shocks in 1130 euros 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.470
 that fit the driving is the road 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.190
 adding the adjustment dynamic alt r 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.190
 response 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.319
 I tried the diesel engine is more 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 powerful combined with automatic transmission 9 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.849
 mar there takes the agile sports record 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.980
 fast but also if the change does its own 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.540
 better he lacks a little push in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.310
 more species when you are there 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.310
 unusual overtaking loads
