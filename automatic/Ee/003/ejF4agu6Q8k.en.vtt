Hi everyone! I hope you're good :D

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.100
I'll show you how i made these origami hearts

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.840
You can use them for Valentine's Day

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
decorate envelopes or presents for Mother's Day

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.080
or other occasions :)

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.520
you can write on the heart

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.180
or you can slide a small note inside the crack here

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.640
you can use it as a bookmark

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.440
you can also glue them on pencils

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
you can varnish them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.380
I varnish them with wood lacquer

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.900
don't hesitate to click on the text which appeared to see how i wash my paintbrushes after i used wood lacquer

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:58.020
because wood lacquer is really hard to remove and make the hair of the paintbrushes really hard :(

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.300
If you varnish them you can use them for jewelry

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.020
you can use beautiful paper to make these hearts, like origami paper with motives :)

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.300
or customise with glitter, stickers, etc

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.180
We need a square of paper

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.040
I cut a sheet of paper in half (this is half a sheet of paper)

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.760
and then i fold here

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.160
and i cut here, along the line

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.160
I open, and i fold in the other diagonal

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
I open

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.040
I bring the tip to the center

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.840
the line here has to be straight

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.460
i bring this tip to the top

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.180
Along the line we put this side

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.040
and then the other side

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.200
we fold on the sides

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.940
and the tips at the top

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
And that's it! :D

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.780
If we want to make smaller ones we take a smaller square of paper ;)

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.100
and if we want to make bigger ones we take a bigger square of paper ;)

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.840
Thank you for watching :)

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.820
I hope you liked the video or that it was useful

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.580
If so don't forget to give me a thumb up ;)

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580
Have a nice day! :)
