00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
into the canon service center drop it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.100 
into the canon service center drop it
off<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.189> couple<00:00:08.580> days<00:00:08.730> later<00:00:09.000> pick<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.809> up<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
off a couple days later pick it up and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.930 
off a couple days later pick it up and
it<00:00:10.380> looks<00:00:10.620> exactly<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.250> same

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
it looks exactly the same

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.379 
it looks exactly the same
I<00:00:12.139> meant<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.200> camera<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.730> technology<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
I meant the camera so this technology is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
I meant the camera so this technology is
dual<00:00:15.660> pixel<00:00:16.020> AF<00:00:16.619> which<00:00:16.890> means<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.310> super

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
dual pixel AF which means it's super

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.210 
dual pixel AF which means it's super

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

for composition me I'm going to see if
it<00:00:39.239> limits<00:00:39.540> me<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.469> put<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.920> the

it limits me when I put it on the

it limits me when I put it on the
Steadicam<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.790> give<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> whirl

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.410 

we<00:00:48.719> started<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> Canon<00:00:49.559> 16<00:00:49.949> to<00:00:50.100> 35<00:00:50.460> F<00:00:50.699> 2.8

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
we started with the Canon 16 to 35 F 2.8

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
we started with the Canon 16 to 35 F 2.8
but<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.719> definitely<00:00:51.899> wasn't<00:00:52.379> vocalist<00:00:52.949> enough

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
but it definitely wasn't vocalist enough

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 
but it definitely wasn't vocalist enough
so<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.089> zoomed<00:00:54.269> in<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> 35<00:00:54.839> millimeter<00:00:55.289> our

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so we zoomed in to 35 millimeter our

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350 
so we zoomed in to 35 millimeter our
first<00:00:56.159> impression<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> autofocus

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
first impression is the autofocus

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.899 
first impression is the autofocus
capabilities<00:00:57.559> pretty<00:00:58.559> sweet<00:00:58.949> even<00:00:59.519> ignoring

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
capabilities pretty sweet even ignoring

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
our overzealous BTS girl the honeymoon
stage<00:01:03.809> soon<00:01:04.199> whirl<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> limitations

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
stage soon whirl and the limitations

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.120 
stage soon whirl and the limitations
appeared<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.869> autofocus<00:01:07.289> is<00:01:07.560> fast<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
appeared the autofocus is fast that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
appeared the autofocus is fast that
means<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.759> be<00:01:08.880> fast<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.299> focus<00:01:09.659> where<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
means it can be fast to focus where you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.930 
means it can be fast to focus where you
don't<00:01:10.289> want<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.649> to<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> only<00:01:11.340> point<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
don't want it to if you only point at it

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.529 
don't want it to if you only point at it
for<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.630> moment<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.880> main<00:01:15.060> issue<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
for a little moment the main issue is

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:16.730 
for a little moment the main issue is

showed<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> lot<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.410> confusion<00:01:45.800> missing<00:01:46.310> focus

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670

freakout<00:01:49.790> at<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:50.570> point<00:01:51.790> my<00:01:52.790> guess<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.180> that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
freakout at one point my guess is that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.750 
freakout at one point my guess is that
the<00:01:53.479> scene<00:01:53.750> lacks<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.260> contrast<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.100> c100

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
the scene lacks the contrast of the c100

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.030 
interesting enough Marcus's orange
became<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.240> c100<00:02:02.840> s<00:02:02.930> best<00:02:03.110> friend<00:02:03.440> perhaps

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
became the c100 s best friend perhaps

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.920 
became the c100 s best friend perhaps
even<00:02:04.280> its<00:02:04.550> love<00:02:04.790> interest<00:02:05.210> because<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.690> nailed

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
even its love interest because it nailed

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.900 
even its love interest because it nailed
its<00:02:06.140> focus<00:02:06.500> consistently<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.250> orange<00:02:07.700> I'm

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
its focus consistently on the orange I'm

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.730 
its focus consistently on the orange I'm
guessing<00:02:08.570> because<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.990> has<00:02:09.110> such<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.380> stark

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
guessing because it has such a stark

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.440 
guessing because it has such a stark
chroma<00:02:10.070> contrast<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.150> an<00:02:11.270> easy

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
chroma contrast that it was an easy

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.240 
chroma contrast that it was an easy
target<00:02:13.420> okay<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.480> 16<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.080> 35<00:02:15.470> already<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.010> bit<00:02:16.160> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
target okay so 16 to 35 already a bit of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430 
target okay so 16 to 35 already a bit of
a<00:02:16.340> challenge<00:02:16.550> for<00:02:16.880> focusing<00:02:17.420> on<00:02:17.570> Steadicam

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
a challenge for focusing on Steadicam

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.690 
a challenge for focusing on Steadicam
now<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.220> try<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.060> 135<00:02:21.050> EFX<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:25.430> I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
now we're going to try the 135 EFX now I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.610 
now we're going to try the 135 EFX now I

orange still gets all the love so our
main<00:03:06.720> takeaway<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.500> actually<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.069> we<00:03:08.310> can

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
main takeaway is actually that we can

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.309 
main takeaway is actually that we can
now<00:03:08.640> shoot<00:03:08.879> with<00:03:09.090> much<00:03:09.420> longer<00:03:09.870> lenses

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
now shoot with much longer lenses

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.400 
now shoot with much longer lenses

shooting wide open on Steadicam that
little<00:03:13.680> square<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.819> little<00:03:15.690> bit<00:03:15.930> hard<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
little square is a little bit hard to

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.020 
little square is a little bit hard to
work<00:03:16.680> with<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.010> would<00:03:17.220> say<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:18.000> just

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
work with I would say that this is just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.320 
work with I would say that this is just
an<00:03:18.360> assistant<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.650> some<00:03:19.950> shots<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.549> nothing<00:03:21.209> to

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
an assistant to some shots is nothing to

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.430 
an assistant to some shots is nothing to
rely<00:03:21.660> on
