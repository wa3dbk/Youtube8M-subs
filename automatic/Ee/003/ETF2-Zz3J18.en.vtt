beams angle of incidence compares with

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.160 
beams angle of incidence compares with
its<00:00:54.289> angle<00:00:54.589> of<00:00:54.710> reflection<00:00:55.179> to<00:00:56.179> do<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:56.600> we

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
its angle of reflection to do this we

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.110 
its angle of reflection to do this we
need<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.410> accurately<00:00:57.739> record<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.670> path<00:00:58.879> of

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
need to accurately record the path of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.479 
need to accurately record the path of
the<00:00:59.210> light<00:00:59.390> rays<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.929> then<00:01:00.469> use<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.800> protractor

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the light rays and then use a protractor

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.359 
the light rays and then use a protractor
to<00:01:01.910> measure<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.390> angles<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.710> instructions

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
to measure the angles the instructions

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.590 
to measure the angles the instructions
are<00:01:04.519> all<00:01:04.670> on<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.059> law<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.420> reflection

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
incident and reflected rays by placing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.930 
incident and reflected rays by placing
two<00:01:35.299> small<00:01:35.930> dots<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.409> each<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.710> them

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.790 

using<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.030> ruler<00:01:40.270> connect<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.350> dots<00:01:41.560> with

using a ruler connect the dots with
straight<00:01:42.370> lines

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
straight lines

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.800 
straight lines
you<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.790> now<00:01:45.910> measure<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.360> angle<00:01:46.720> of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
you can now measure the angle of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.330 
you can now measure the angle of
incidence<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.500> angle<00:01:47.800> of<00:01:48.130> reflection

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
incidence and the angle of reflection

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.300 
incidence and the angle of reflection
with<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> protractor<00:01:49.600> which<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.710> best<00:01:50.980> placed

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
with a protractor which is best placed

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.480 
with a protractor which is best placed
like<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.930> line<00:01:53.200> marked<00:01:53.590> 90<00:01:54.100> degrees<00:01:54.460> on

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
like this the line marked 90 degrees on

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.000 
like this the line marked 90 degrees on
the<00:01:54.820> protractor<00:01:55.330> will<00:01:55.870> be<00:01:56.020> your<00:01:56.260> zero<00:01:56.560> degrees

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
the protractor will be your zero degrees

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.910 
the protractor will be your zero degrees
so<00:01:57.760> in<00:01:57.910> this<00:01:58.060> case<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.840> angle<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.290> reflection

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
so in this case the angle of reflection

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.940 
so in this case the angle of reflection
is<00:02:00.070> 35<00:02:00.850> degrees<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.410> angle<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.800> incidence

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
is 35 degrees and the angle of incidence

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.350 
is 35 degrees and the angle of incidence
is<00:02:03.640> also<00:02:04.060> 35<00:02:04.420> degrees<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.369> just<00:02:06.850> repeating

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
is also 35 degrees so just repeating

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.419
