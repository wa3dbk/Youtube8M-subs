00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.620
 So, in this video, you will see how you can prepare the most simple pitas for a hive at home. 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:35.080
 1 cup of flour (the most common flour we use every day) Water Salt Extra Virgin Olive Oil 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.640
 Pour the flour, salt to taste 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.720
 add 2 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.480
 and about half a glass of water 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 Stir a little and add some more water. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.120
 Stir wooden spoon. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.760
 Here it is. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.120
 We continue to knead further 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.080
 Knead well, bend, wring around ... 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.760
 Go further on the board 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.560
 add flour that would not stick to hands 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 Tear off half of the dough 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 bend, wring around ... 

00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:29.688
 crush, roll out 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.640
 we want thin, but not very thin ... 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.240
 On a heated pot, pour olive oil 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240
 we put pita 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.680
 We need about 3 minutes for each side. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 By-by ... inflated! :) 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.760
 No need to overcook 

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:51.302
 You can eat or put in the freezer 

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:55.062
 Ready, perfect, homemade pita for a bitch! 

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.905
 Until !
