00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.400
 When I came across this piece, 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.967
 They were in a dark storage area. 

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:20.334
 Revealed their appearance of light 

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:23.266
 Nature, and characters' beauty 

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.433
 Even the beauty of ugliness. I saw its historical place 

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.967
 In the history of Gothic sculpture in the thirteenth century. 

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:33.600
 Through the analysis of the stone itself, 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 This proved 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.333
 It is connected to the Great Cathedral of Amiens. It was in a great architectural setting, 

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:50.200
 The veil of the choir is intertwined with other scenes of the life of Christ. 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.967
 As you approach the piece, one sees the tragedy. You see them from behind. 

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:00.000
 Almost merge with the event as a viewer. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.266
 Within a very shallow space of about ten inches, where three layers of characters appear together 

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.100
 three 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 Important Events 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.834
 Of the life of Christ - the beginning of the end of his life on earth - 

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:21.800
 The kiss of Judas that calls 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.100
 Soldier to arrest him. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
 At the same time, St. Peter, in a moment of great anger, 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.300
 Cut the ear of a finisher 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.400
 The servant of the high priest. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.900
 There is one feature that is really amazing, 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.600
 It is a striking resemblance between the face of Christ and Judah. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.266
 You can not see the face of Judah; for it is, in fact, identical. 

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.333
 Amid violence and chaos, 

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.667
 Christ intervenes 

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:02.800
 And a miracle brings the ear back to the mouth 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.000
 You have to examine the beauty, tranquility and strength of the healing miracle that occurs here, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.934
 In a very tight space, 

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:16.166
 She shows an artist with unparalleled creativity and ingenuity. 

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:20.634
 No such thing has ever been done before.
