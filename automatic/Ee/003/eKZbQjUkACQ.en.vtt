00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
threw up a lot in that class it didn't

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
threw up a lot in that class it didn't
happen<00:00:52.230> every<00:00:52.770> class<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> was<00:00:53.969> frequent

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
happen every class but it was frequent

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
happen every class but it was frequent
enough<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.350> point<00:00:55.379> people<00:00:56.160> stopped

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
enough that at one point people stopped

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.549 
enough that at one point people stopped
being<00:00:56.730> surprised<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> course<00:00:58.170> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
gigantic rope that's not the best place

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
gigantic rope that's not the best place
to<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.640> trying<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> plan<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> hot

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and fast exit strategy turns out that it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
and fast exit strategy turns out that it
actually<00:01:14.850> takes<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.990> precious<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.220> get

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
actually takes some precious time to get

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
actually takes some precious time to get
someone<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:17.820> from<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> height<00:01:18.780> especially

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
now I understand that a lot of it had to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.039 
now I understand that a lot of it had to
do<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.759> rough<00:01:27.119> antibiotic<00:01:27.930> but

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I was taking that air but climbing was

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
I was taking that air but climbing was
always<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.810> catalyst<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> actual

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
always the catalyst for the actual

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
always the catalyst for the actual
vomiting<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.659> gym<00:01:33.900> class

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and I had to climb to get a grade so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
and I had to climb to get a grade so
each<00:01:36.810> class<00:01:37.079> became<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> sort<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> sick

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
each class became the sort of sick

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
each class became the sort of sick
guessing<00:01:38.790> game<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.150> played<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.570> myself<00:01:39.720> to
