sneaking<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.140> guess<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.160> means<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.520> this

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
sneaking I guess what it means is this

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.090

blocks<00:00:35.790> cannot<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.390> rotated<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.950> see

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
blocks cannot be rotated so if you see

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.850 
blocks cannot be rotated so if you see
they<00:00:38.610> normally<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.480> down<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.840> way<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
they normally go down this way if you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.729 
they normally go down this way if you
point<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.000> sideways<00:00:42.739> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
point them this way like sideways it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
point them this way like sideways it
comes<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.160> differently<00:00:44.840> ok<00:00:45.840> also<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.379> shovel

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
comes out differently ok also the shovel

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529 
comes out differently ok also the shovel
is<00:00:46.829> now<00:00:46.950> faster<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.579> soul<00:00:47.789> sand<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.329> path

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
is now faster on soul sand and path

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
is now faster on soul sand and path
block<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.260> let's<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.649> ahead<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.090> on

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
block so let's go ahead and use this on

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.709 
block so let's go ahead and use this on
soul<00:00:51.809> sands<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.370> survival<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.270> that's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
soul sands and I'm in survival so that's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.470 
soul sands and I'm in survival so that's
pretty<00:00:54.960> fast<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.180> ahead<00:00:57.360> and

pretty fast and then let's go ahead and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
pretty fast and then let's go ahead and
turn<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:57.989> paths<00:00:58.199> blocks<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.890> wait

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
turn these two paths blocks will wait

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
turn these two paths blocks will wait
and<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:02.059> don't<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> actually
