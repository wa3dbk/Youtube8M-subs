hear it at all so what we do is we take

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.210 
hear it at all so what we do is we take
the<00:01:49.850> speaker<00:01:50.420> out<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:51.680> way<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.860> get<00:01:52.070> the

preamp to the power tubes everything the
am<00:01:54.320> past<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.400> feed<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.670> right<00:01:56.030> into

in here you met your impedance you're a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.249 
in here you met your impedance you're a
standard<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.239> eight<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.630> if<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.840> want<00:02:09.050> for

won't<00:02:29.330> even<00:02:29.510> hear<00:02:29.720> you'll<00:02:30.080> put<00:02:30.290> your<00:02:30.440> ear<00:02:30.620> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
won't even hear you'll put your ear to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
won't even hear you'll put your ear to
it<00:02:30.920> let's<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.550> okay<00:02:31.850> let's<00:02:32.330> do<00:02:32.570> that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.180 

that's<00:02:36.540> right<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:37.080> should<00:02:37.260> see<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.500> led<00:02:38.010> come

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that's right we should see this led come

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.339 
that's right we should see this led come
on<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.520> when<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> hit<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> strings

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.050 

so<00:02:45.349> that's<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.620> signal<00:02:45.800> present<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.610> lets<00:02:46.940> you

so that's a signal present that lets you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.000 
so that's a signal present that lets you
know<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.450> signal<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.930> present<00:02:48.140> any<00:02:48.739> time
