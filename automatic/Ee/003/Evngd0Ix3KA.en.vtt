I<00:00:09.870> want<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> destroy<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:10.680> I'm<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> be

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.220 
I want to destroy what I'm going to be

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.190 
I want to destroy what I'm going to be
using<00:00:11.640> here<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.309> carbon

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
using here this is a carbon

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.429 
using here this is a carbon
Hunter<00:00:15.620> so<00:00:16.400> on<00:00:16.600> arrow<00:00:17.600> size<00:00:17.840> just<00:00:18.020> 350<00:00:18.950> greens

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
Hunter so on arrow size just 350 greens

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.370 
Hunter so on arrow size just 350 greens
it's<00:00:21.439> got<00:00:22.270> built-in<00:00:23.270> weight<00:00:24.170> forward<00:00:24.800> design

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
it's got built-in weight forward design

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.839 
it's got built-in weight forward design
which<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.590> supposed<00:00:27.860> to<00:00:27.919> help<00:00:28.099> with<00:00:28.369> accuracy

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
which is supposed to help with accuracy

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.880 
which is supposed to help with accuracy
and<00:00:29.330> penetration<00:00:30.289> of<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.919> arrow<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:32.620> the<00:00:33.620> back

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
and penetration of the arrow so the back

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.160 
and penetration of the arrow so the back
is<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.399> little<00:00:35.000> bit<00:00:35.120> lighter<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.660> back<00:00:35.809> third

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
is a little bit lighter the back third

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.510 
is a little bit lighter the back third
and<00:00:36.500> they<00:00:37.430> use<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:39.320> arrow<00:00:39.710> technology<00:00:40.370> is

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
and they use the arrow technology is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.850 
and they use the arrow technology is
it's<00:00:40.760> called<00:00:40.910> buff<00:00:41.210> tough<00:00:41.510> plus<00:00:41.899> makes<00:00:42.770> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
it's called buff tough plus makes a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.799 
it's called buff tough plus makes a
little<00:00:42.980> bit<00:00:43.070> lighter<00:00:43.370> back<00:00:43.670> here<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.480> helps

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
little bit lighter back here that helps

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.049 
little bit lighter back here that helps
with<00:00:44.930> arrow<00:00:45.200> recovery<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.370> out<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.879> bow

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
with arrow recovery so out of the bow

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.290 
with arrow recovery so out of the bow
and<00:00:47.240> helps<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:47.540> stabilize<00:00:48.050> faster<00:00:49.060> and<00:00:50.060> then

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
and helps it stabilize faster and then

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.770 
and helps it stabilize faster and then
the<00:00:50.450> front<00:00:50.690> two-thirds<00:00:51.170> are<00:00:51.440> buff<00:00:51.890> tough

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the front two-thirds are buff tough

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.390 
the front two-thirds are buff tough
which<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.079> then<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:54.620> has<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.890> weight<00:00:55.070> forward

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
which and then it has the weight forward

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.120 
which and then it has the weight forward
so<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.630> front<00:00:56.900> is<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.440> buff<00:00:57.620> tough<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
so the front is that the buff tough is a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.250 
so the front is that the buff tough is a
little<00:00:58.400> bit<00:00:58.490> more<00:00:58.670> durable<00:00:59.120> or<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.810> little<00:01:00.140> bit

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
little bit more durable or a little bit

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.960 
little bit more durable or a little bit
I<00:01:00.470> mean<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:00.980> all<00:01:01.100> durable<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:01.670> an<00:01:01.790> all

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
I mean it's all durable it's an all

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.940 
I mean it's all durable it's an all
carbon<00:01:02.420> arrow<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:02.900> gives<00:01:03.560> it<00:01:03.650> a<00:01:03.680> little<00:01:03.800> bit

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
carbon arrow but gives it a little bit

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:13.590 
carbon arrow but gives it a little bit
more<00:01:04.070> stiffness<00:01:07.840> then<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.020> also<00:01:09.200> has<00:01:11.799> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
more stiffness then it also has the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.730 
more stiffness then it also has the
arrow<00:01:14.600> protectors<00:01:15.140> it's<00:01:15.350> called<00:01:15.560> these

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
arrow protectors it's called these

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.569 
arrow protectors it's called these
bulldog

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
bulldog

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.999 
bulldog
nock<00:01:16.939> collar<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:18.049> helps<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.530> if<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:18.770> arrow

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
nock collar this helps so if the arrow

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.520 
nock collar this helps so if the arrow
or<00:01:19.520> if<00:01:19.609> the<00:01:19.729> strain<00:01:20.090> were<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.389> somehow<00:01:21.139> slide

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
or if the strain were to somehow slide

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.559 
or if the strain were to somehow slide
off<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.770> arrow<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.880> would<00:01:23.090> protect<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
off the arrow and it would protect the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.660 
off the arrow and it would protect the
arrow<00:01:23.749> shaft<00:01:24.139> from<00:01:24.829> any<00:01:24.979> damage<00:01:25.399> from<00:01:25.549> this

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
arrow shaft from any damage from this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.969 
arrow shaft from any damage from this
string<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.119> also<00:01:29.329> has<00:01:29.979> timber

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
string and then it also has timber

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.949 
string and then it also has timber
illusion<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.880> camo<00:01:32.149> pattern<00:01:32.630> that's<00:01:32.810> on

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
illusion is the camo pattern that's on

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.209 
illusion is the camo pattern that's on
here<00:01:33.880> made<00:01:34.880> by<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.509> she<00:01:35.630> says<00:01:35.810> mossy<00:01:36.319> on<00:01:36.590> the

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
here made by and she says mossy on the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.459 
here made by and she says mossy on the
package<00:01:37.609> that<00:01:37.759> says<00:01:37.939> says<00:01:38.600> timber<00:01:38.959> illusion

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
package that says says timber illusion

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.679 
package that says says timber illusion
on<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.829> actual<00:01:40.159> arrow<00:01:40.399> itself<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.030> says<00:01:41.209> mossy

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
on the actual arrow itself it says mossy

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.169 
on the actual arrow itself it says mossy
oak<00:01:41.869> tree<00:01:42.649> stands<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:45.789> guess<00:01:46.789> I<00:01:46.909> would<00:01:47.060> go

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
oak tree stands so I guess I would go

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.239 
oak tree stands so I guess I would go
with<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.479> mossy<00:01:48.049> oak<00:01:48.079> tree<00:01:48.409> stand<00:01:48.679> it's<00:01:49.189> a

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
with the mossy oak tree stand it's a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.620 
with the mossy oak tree stand it's a
great<00:01:49.459> arrow<00:01:49.670> I've<00:01:49.880> got<00:01:50.299> really<00:01:50.539> good

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
great arrow I've got really good

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.609 
great arrow I've got really good
accuracy<00:01:51.289> out<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:53.840> good<00:01:54.109> as<00:01:54.289> I<00:01:54.439> am

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
accuracy out of it as good as I am

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.010 
accuracy out of it as good as I am
anyway<00:01:55.090> probably<00:01:56.090> don't<00:01:56.329> practice<00:01:56.719> as<00:01:56.869> much

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
anyway probably don't practice as much

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.999 
anyway probably don't practice as much
as<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.289> should<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:58.689> I<00:01:59.689> get<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.709> know<00:02:00.799> pretty

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
as I should but I get you know pretty

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.580 
as I should but I get you know pretty
consistent<00:02:01.549> groups<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.049> good<00:02:03.200> arrow<00:02:03.380> I

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
consistent groups so it's good arrow I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.489 
consistent groups so it's good arrow I
like<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.099> a<00:02:04.159> lot<00:02:04.369> one<00:02:04.909> thing<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.179> found<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:06.409> know

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
like it a lot one thing I found you know

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.199 
like it a lot one thing I found you know
I've<00:02:06.590> always<00:02:07.069> been<00:02:07.189> a<00:02:07.249> fan<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.549> camouflage<00:02:08.179> I

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
I've always been a fan of camouflage I

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.480 
I've always been a fan of camouflage I
guess<00:02:08.690> I'm<00:02:08.840> kind<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.229> kind<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.950> country<00:02:10.310> I

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
guess I'm kind of a kind of country I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.160 
guess I'm kind of a kind of country I
like<00:02:11.209> camouflage<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.900> my<00:02:11.990> stuff<00:02:13.270> once<00:02:14.270> I'm<00:02:14.420> you

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
like camouflage on my stuff once I'm you

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
like camouflage on my stuff once I'm you
know<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> last<00:02:15.740> five<00:02:16.010> years<00:02:16.040> I've<00:02:16.520> missed

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
know in the last five years I've missed

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.870 
know in the last five years I've missed
the<00:02:17.150> target<00:02:17.390> once<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.950> was<00:02:19.069> just<00:02:19.370> about<00:02:19.819> a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the target once and it was just about a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.480 
the target once and it was just about a
month<00:02:20.180> ago<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.920> these<00:02:21.920> are<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.099> was<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.370> as
