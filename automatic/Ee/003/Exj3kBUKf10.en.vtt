00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.080
 who this silence 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.130
 they tell Hoenig 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.130
 the 1 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.549
 now sizable of the Swedes services 8 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.149
 that was a great weekend 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.720
 Everyone got what they deserved 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.240
 The Pope has the unbelievable speed for the Vatican 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 Resignation of Bochum Bishop, plagued by bursa on his knee » 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.390
 Walter Mixa and the voters in North Rhine-Westphalia have the unimagined 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.010
 Sovereignty accepted the resignation request of the black and yellow government 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.810
 The longer I think about it, the better I like the election result 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.890
 from sunday 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.610
 Of course, the blacksmith is clearly right when he asks what the voter wants 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.840
 actually 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.320
 but if you do not really know what you want it is not the worst 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.930
 Method to find out first 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.480
 what you do not want 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.270
 no 8 months after the federal election at which the FDP in Ochtrup it falls 14 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.240
 Kopper 9 percent has brought and imagined on the way to the third People's Party 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.180
 the voter has trimmed her back to what she is 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.230
 a six point something clientele 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.790
 The FDP has it all under the virtuoso leadership of Fitzek 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.040
 Westerwelle managed to scare 55 percent of their voters in 8 months 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.010
 that's an achievement that was worth it 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.200
 the CDU, in contrast, has one percent compared to the general election 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.400
 gained 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.710
 the ten percent - compared to the last state election 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 Lena so fully on the account of Jara place 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 Obviously, the sovereign does not want to be a prime minister 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.469
 alights 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.009
 not even one who does not even know that he is renting from his own party 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.680
 is offered 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.950
 Well Mr. Rüttgers 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.130
 that's what you get from it 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 if you as bad made Johannes Rau copy just on Mother's Day 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.550
 to compete against a woman 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.660
 how did the CDU make a placard at the general election? 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.180
 we have the strength 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.120
 that's the Rüttgers now, too 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.750
 on the neck 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.400
 if he is lucky 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.170
 whether woman strength her luck on the election evening still pretty thick neck » 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.460
 I would like to be a worker leader 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.179
 or if she dares the attempt with a red-red-green majority herself 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.860
 To become Prime Minister that is the exciting question of this election 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.879
 For the third time in a row to Thuringia and Saarland, the voter has now 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.089
 put a red-red-green majority on the table 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:26.459
 the voters spoke and I believe he asked a question 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.659
 the SPD really wants to actively pursue a different policy in a leadership role 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.749
 or, under the guise of stability, it just wants it somehow on the 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.499
 Government to be involved 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.419
 that this must answer the Gretchen question Mrs. Hannelore now 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.650
 I'm curious how much power she has
