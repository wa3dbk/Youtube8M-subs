00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
 I just want the choice of others 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.060
 veghel don't think that 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.120
 nice food 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 I also see the most important prize I have won and I want it 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 completely wrong can continue to run true but we can keep saying 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.870
 That said he overflowed to find February allowed from a supermarket says of 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.920
 not in the least by the fourth man but then know that by e-mail but then 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.949
 was it was not possible has been a fair chance since Saturday 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.739
 and that is so when he fiercely opposes the bio industry 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.600
 I never have what it is like to buy for possible personal fraud 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 that this is not on his side of French from the strokes, which is often very pure 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 Belgian army 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.970
 we only know something where I think I am not in it but I fear a certain one 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.810
 way 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.640
 a special feeling about having disorders together in the new series of 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 the woman 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.080
 expected to be he turned 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.430
 it is a sensible argument if people do not want to pay for wikileaks 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.570
 of her innocence as to whether the big bang has refused to take place 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.840
 take 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.540
 those people pay was lower than with men 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.490
 consumer at the politics the hague went back to work saturday 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.060
 and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.350
 that everyone does something about it and that we do something together with it, I understand that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.549
 not only the flurries were only there due to battles with the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.240
 rebels and four ask all sorts of questions 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 But the question is whether they make it an excuse to hear scissors more often 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 I just understand it too much violence 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.700
 But the question is whether just party or not and there is a great experience that I like 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.539
 do you have the idea that it is a change 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.200
 but luckily but I don't say that because they are committed 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.759
 the moment you go to the grocery store sing the chance for a wall to die 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.410
 then a bus in this form i want those choices 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.080
 but you just want cheap pls your wallet important that says the choice 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.700
 I myself decide what I also but why do you choose then it also becomes one 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.180
 fair price that there was a paper bag that is way too low 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.710
 so that you know for sure that animals are being abused and that is past thirty 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 years he has known in a statement 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.049
 not just halal meat 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.280
 I also read that in the flesh of animals that never go outside 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 have families of which 79 were without anesthesia 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.319
 on 15 December extra water storage for the past 30 years is meat 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.820
 become cheaper and cheaper at the expense of the animals 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.530
 the constant fear of living costs more and what we want is a spiral 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.279
 breaking through 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:20.129
 slower the us becomes too expensive and that consumers have been on the break for years 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.840
 again new things happening with neighbors they did not succeed 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.010
 chosen people on feelings to others 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.659
 there is no point 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.700
 the uncertain situation the good finds more of you 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.489
 the team won home at home and I don't care to think about that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.679
 animals lead that is simply lod 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.539
 my wallet is more important to me than their fate well then have to say that 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:44.679
 the site of the feyenoord procedure is a huge relapse 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:45.559
 The Netherlands 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:46.619
 I have 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.929
 I have said before that recently discovered that school struggles are owned 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.049
 from the human 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.049
 agents five where he asked the 15 questions 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.770
 which it is but the question which resources are released 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.269
 dear people themselves smaller animals 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.590
 how can you compare the test to several people with the fact that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.329
 they have the power in a row that he has the power but is that still a 38 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.309
 old man was his first hit in the farmer is owned by a farmer in the 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.359
 near it is and remains one of the men raided a home 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.959
 the side of ing 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.060
 always and then but no property 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.419
 with those directly at each time said of I am going w 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.489
 just want to die as well as possible and that is clear 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.989
 After the land she became over the people who didn't pay for it 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.030
 eleven of them say I want to make sure that the price will be higher again 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:31.929
 lie 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.740
 what do you want as a pig farmer as the golden egg 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.209
 I want I think I say but that delivered what people ask of me 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.079
 and there is a pleasant one and there is a market for it and this one from my size for it 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.279
 autumn at albert heijn says i do like meat with a strong 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.349
 in an animal protection shaft 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.609
 yes and then i think i want to belong and i want to borrow it 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.329
 country and the things that do days that are paid he wants a little more 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.589
 always come back idea today all stars walk out that it is all much better 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.999
 and we have looked once at the ten most important needs of it 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.839
 pig and then walk outside not a bit brown what they said he where 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.899
 they need that has wageningen university has one 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.130
 done research 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.330
 and are those scientists and have looked massively important today 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.340
 values â€‹â€‹that e mail 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.650
 and there we have again some time the island where the analysts and there 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.610
 becomes paying to walk outside 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.629
 and come to 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.949
 and they may run from me on the outside but as my new job too 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.319
 help out 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.110
 sit in his neighborhood inhabited and skilled music 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.219
 and a few I got my mother from the clay and I don't put a pig on him 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.279
 since his first major steps through the small stories also at around half past seven 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:43.639
 and then it hits but I want the right mix of the more frequent work already and me 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.429
 am also an arable farmer s jaap in short and I an image and most 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:50.819
 People from the vessel like that don't feed my customers 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.979
 through which you don't like last job and then as a foreigner in the neighborhood 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.020
 then that is not possible 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.660
 and then those opening gains abroad of five months from 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.789
 you want the year because it is not central 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.479
 and if after eight matches I have only one sentence in it 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.789
 a hero of most was received there 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.889
 and then you can say the second most on each side perhaps as a substitute and 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.539
 temporary driver in kortenberg he is a great person people than normal 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.889
 becomes very difficult to do well and the subsequent animals 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.830
 then I stopped, she explained 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.860
 it is a fact
