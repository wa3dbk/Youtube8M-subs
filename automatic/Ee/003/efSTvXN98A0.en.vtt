things<00:04:02.280> where<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:03.030> think<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.990> took<00:04:04.140> them<00:04:04.380> heat

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
things where I think we took them heat

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.200 
things where I think we took them heat
for<00:04:04.800> not<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> Kentucky<00:04:05.760> Oaks<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
for not going to the Kentucky Oaks and

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.190 
for not going to the Kentucky Oaks and
for<00:04:06.390> staying<00:04:06.630> home<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:08.430> think<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.060> was<00:04:09.210> you

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
for staying home and I think it was you

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.450 
for staying home and I think it was you
know<00:04:10.230> was<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.440> tough<00:04:10.680> race<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.100> can't<00:04:11.340> really

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
know was a tough race you can't really

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.950 
know was a tough race you can't really
say<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.910> finish<00:04:12.180> like<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.660> anybody

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
say in a finish like that that anybody

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.720 
say in a finish like that that anybody
really<00:04:13.230> lost<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:13.770> it<00:04:14.310> was<00:04:14.430> certainly

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
really lost but it was certainly

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.479 
really lost but it was certainly
gratifying<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.450> win<00:04:15.660> because<00:04:16.250> there<00:04:17.250> was<00:04:17.340> some

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
gratifying to win because there was some

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.650 
gratifying to win because there was some
criticism<00:04:17.610> that<00:04:18.030> we<00:04:18.210> should<00:04:18.390> have<00:04:18.450> gone<00:04:18.600> to

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
criticism that we should have gone to

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.030 
criticism that we should have gone to
Derby<00:04:19.080> we<00:04:19.140> should<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.380> gone<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> oaks<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
Derby we should have gone the oaks and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.160 
Derby we should have gone the oaks and
we<00:04:20.100> stayed<00:04:20.340> home<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.660> what<00:04:21.870> we<00:04:21.989> set

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
we stayed home and this is what we set

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.720 
we stayed home and this is what we set
out<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.830> that's<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.250> decision<00:04:23.550> we

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
out to do and that's the decision we

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.580 
out to do and that's the decision we
made<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.210> worked<00:04:24.390> out<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.840> I'm<00:04:24.990> very<00:04:25.380> happy

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
made and it worked out so I'm very happy

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.980 
made and it worked out so I'm very happy
about<00:04:25.830> it
