00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello everyone with you channel lada granta fan 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.370
 in this video I want to show you how you can 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.770
 reset 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.010
 average fuel consumption 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.529
 so I decided to just reset of course 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.199
 I have already dumped so there are feelings for 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.130
 a little untrue 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.980
 consumption is much less so for 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 that we will need the right stalk 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.500
 petal reset key which just 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.520
 will be reset and rightmost 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 upper 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.010
 Keys here look at the instrument panel 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.300
 panel means right and you rocker up 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.719
 down choose here so here is the middle 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 all-time fuel consumption for now 94 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 in everything just I recently dropped and he 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.570
 not yet aligned to the real at all 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.760
 Me for 33 with a penny run 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 seven and nine 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.880
 consumption under how the salon took no cars 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 I never dropped it seems to me when 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 driving style quite well, so this 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.110
 let's say fast acceleration 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.900
 fast braking fast braking 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.820
 that's why i don't know if i think that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.600
 you can achieve less consumption 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.600
 just comments can write 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 What is your average consumption? 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 fuel from which crashed mileage here 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.630
 I will be very grateful 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.630
 if you comment i mean so 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.110
 choose average fuel consumption 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:58.830
 further right rocker the most evil 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.830
 reset key reset key clamp 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:10.140
 as you can see everything is dropped in principle here 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.950
 In principle, everything further you will need 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.230
 wind kilometers 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.920
 I read that for a more accurate mean 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.540
 expense to give you a computer need 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 drive somewhere around a thousand kilometers 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 so if maybe someone didn't know 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.819
 like u do husband it someone 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.080
