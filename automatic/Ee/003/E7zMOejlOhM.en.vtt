in our previous video part 1 we showed
the<00:00:09.879> primary<00:00:10.389> difference<00:00:10.809> between<00:00:10.990> the

several<00:00:27.460> we'll<00:00:28.300> start<00:00:28.570> first<00:00:28.780> of<00:00:28.930> all<00:00:29.050> with

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
several we'll start first of all with

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.500 
several we'll start first of all with
the<00:00:29.260> home<00:00:29.500> invader<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.970> mentioned<00:00:31.330> it's<00:00:31.449> a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
the home invader we mentioned it's a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.080 
the home invader we mentioned it's a
mechanical<00:00:32.020> thermostat<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:33.430> looks<00:00:33.640> like<00:00:33.820> this

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
mechanical thermostat it looks like this

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.840 
mechanical thermostat it looks like this
is<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.570> way<00:00:34.870> for<00:00:34.899> style<00:00:35.410> when<00:00:36.190> you<00:00:36.309> get<00:00:36.550> this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
is a way for style when you get this

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.180 
is a way for style when you get this
you're<00:00:37.630> going<00:00:37.810> to<00:00:37.930> get<00:00:38.050> it<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.380> small<00:00:38.710> packet

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.550 
you're going to get it in a small packet
like<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.880> does<00:00:40.030> not<00:00:40.149> come<00:00:40.420> installed<00:00:40.810> but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
like this it does not come installed but

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.520 
like this it does not come installed but
installation<00:00:42.160> is<00:00:42.340> very<00:00:42.760> very<00:00:43.180> simple<00:00:43.720> set<00:00:44.410> it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
you're set it's really that simple not a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.560 
you're set it's really that simple not a
big<00:00:58.750> deal<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.110> install<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.590> thermostat<00:01:00.010> a

big deal to install that thermostat a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.790 
big deal to install that thermostat a
little<00:01:01.570> giant<00:01:01.930> does<00:01:02.170> come<00:01:02.500> pre-installed

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
little giant does come pre-installed

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.760 
little giant does come pre-installed
it's<00:01:03.640> just<00:01:03.820> ready<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.059> go<00:01:04.210> plug<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:04.809> in<00:01:04.930> adjust

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
it's just ready to go plug it in adjust

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's just ready to go plug it in adjust
the<00:01:05.860> knob<00:01:06.039> and<00:01:06.640> you're<00:01:06.820> good

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
the knob and you're good

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.480 
the knob and you're good
the<00:01:07.509> next<00:01:07.810> big<00:01:08.229> visible<00:01:08.649> difference<00:01:09.280> you'll

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the next big visible difference you'll

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.480 
the next big visible difference you'll
see<00:01:09.760> is<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.210> little<00:01:10.450> giant<00:01:10.900> has<00:01:11.170> these<00:01:12.100> large

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
see is the little giant has these large

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.000 
see is the little giant has these large
viewing<00:01:13.299> windows<00:01:13.630> two<00:01:14.020> of<00:01:14.170> them<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.830> home

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
viewing windows two of them the home

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.810 
viewing windows two of them the home
invader<00:01:15.310> also<00:01:15.790> has<00:01:15.940> viewing<00:01:16.330> windows<00:01:16.659> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
invader also has viewing windows a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820 
invader also has viewing windows a
little<00:01:18.820> bit<00:01:19.060> smaller<00:01:19.450> but<00:01:20.170> still<00:01:20.320> they<00:01:20.590> do<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
little bit smaller but still they do the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit smaller but still they do the
job<00:01:21.070> just<00:01:21.100> fine<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:24.130> viewing<00:01:24.460> windows<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
job just fine the viewing windows in the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.140 
job just fine the viewing windows in the
little<00:01:25.210> giant<00:01:25.659> will<00:01:26.140> actually<00:01:26.619> come<00:01:26.920> out<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
little giant will actually come out so

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.500 
little giant will actually come out so
for<00:01:28.689> example<00:01:29.110> after<00:01:29.290> your<00:01:29.650> chicks<00:01:29.920> hatch<00:01:30.510> you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
for example after your chicks hatch you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.420 
for example after your chicks hatch you
can<00:01:31.689> take<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> window<00:01:32.320> out<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.979> pull<00:01:33.220> them<00:01:33.340> out

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
can take the window out to pull them out

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.800 
can take the window out to pull them out
if<00:01:33.610> you'd<00:01:33.729> like<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.119> find<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.720> be<00:01:34.780> a

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
if you'd like I find that it to be a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.740 
if you'd like I find that it to be a
nice<00:01:35.020> feature<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.790> home<00:01:36.970> invader<00:01:37.270> windows<00:01:37.659> do

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
nice feature the home invader windows do
