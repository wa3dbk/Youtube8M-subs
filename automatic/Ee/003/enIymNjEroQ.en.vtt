00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.089
 here we are new position sensor 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.089
 throttle body 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.690
 I changed it does not remove itself 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.000
 throttle here two bolts at 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.110
 me they 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.860
 11 bolt on top of another bolt 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.110
 below well and now there is not visible but he is there 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.380
 There is a sensor ordered from a Chinese site 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.380
 aliexpress 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.180
 it cost 700 rubles for all mounts 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.180
 landing places suitable 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.060
 the reason for the replacement was not old 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.060
 faulty sensor here it is 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.290
 old sensor 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.149
 noticeably thicker than the new picture will be 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.149
 it is seen 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.460
 the computer gave the twelfth error 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 actually for this reason it was necessary 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 order a new cottage and for the same reason 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.360
 skills worked le onde umbrella because 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.350
 for example now i will turn it extreme 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:41.479
 position here he stands up 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:44.039
 We look at the indication of the linda of the zones 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.920
 increased coefficient almost 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.459
 fixed the same testimony was with 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.459
 old gauge 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.209
 From Tarot with two wires goes one to the ground 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.399
 engine 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:00.530
 pipe to the signal sensor wire whether 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:09.319
 she zones there I will connect 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.319
 here so let's turn the new sensor 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.230
 as it should, and look at the tester testimony 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.239
 which takes readings for nda zones then 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.680
 there we see how it should work 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:37.069
 linda reading fluctuate 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 roughly speaking at intervals of 10 times 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.250
 ten seconds 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.830
 oh the wire to jumped oh well 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.860
 but in general everything is clear
