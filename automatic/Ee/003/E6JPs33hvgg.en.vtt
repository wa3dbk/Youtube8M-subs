but<00:01:58.640> anyway<00:02:00.530> yeah<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> engineering<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
but anyway yeah the engineering was you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
but anyway yeah the engineering was you
know<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.789> work<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.060> motorcycles<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.720> was<00:02:03.960> my

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
know I can work on motorcycles I was my

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 
know I can work on motorcycles I was my
first<00:02:04.410> interest<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.009> first<00:02:05.280> love<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.700> was

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
first interest and first love was was

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.509 
first interest and first love was was
building<00:02:06.660> motors<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:08.250> building

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
building motors and the building

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.100 
building motors and the building
two-stroke<00:02:08.910> motors<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.899> there's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
two-stroke motors and you know there's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
two-stroke motors and you know there's
certainly<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.500> lot<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.799> engineering<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.489> in

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
certainly a lot of engineering in in

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.059 
certainly a lot of engineering in in
building<00:02:12.480> fast<00:02:12.690> motors

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.209 

and<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:19.239> way<00:02:19.329> had<00:02:19.450> riders<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.019> were<00:02:20.230> were

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
and the way had riders that were were

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.039 
and the way had riders that were were
coming<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:22.000> me<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.329> going<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.780> know<00:02:22.810> hey<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
coming to me and going you know hey you

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.440 
coming to me and going you know hey you
can<00:02:23.379> build<00:02:23.530> my<00:02:23.620> motor<00:02:23.859> but<00:02:24.189> you<00:02:25.000> know<00:02:25.090> my

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
can build my motor but you know my

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
can build my motor but you know my
suspension<00:02:26.019> is<00:02:26.170> doing<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.769> or<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.099> doing

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
suspension is doing this or it's doing

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.099 
suspension is doing this or it's doing
that<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.579> can<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.849> rebuild<00:02:28.329> it<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.750> know<00:02:28.870> and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
that or can you rebuild it you know and

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.770 
that or can you rebuild it you know and
and<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.859> started<00:02:30.549> rebuilding<00:02:30.969> I<00:02:31.239> went<00:02:31.420> wow<00:02:31.510> this

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
and I started rebuilding I went wow this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.649 
and I started rebuilding I went wow this
is<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.409> interesting<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:33.189> and<00:02:33.569> there's<00:02:34.569> a

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
is this is interesting and and there's a

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.440 
is this is interesting and and there's a
lot<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:35.049> engineering<00:02:35.739> in<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.450> suspension

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
lot more engineering in in suspension

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.089 
lot more engineering in in suspension
and<00:02:37.569> certainly<00:02:38.019> in<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.680> middle

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
and certainly in the in the middle

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.860 
and certainly in the in the middle
seventies<00:02:39.609> is<00:02:39.849> kind<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.120> when<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.450> long

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
seventies is kind of when the long

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.280 
seventies is kind of when the long
travel<00:02:41.170> revolution<00:02:41.829> started<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.290> suspension

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
travel revolution started and suspension

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.149 
travel revolution started and suspension
technology<00:02:44.439> was<00:02:45.159> just<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.819> crazy<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.480> and

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
technology was just going crazy and and

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.559 
technology was just going crazy and and
so<00:02:48.159> I<00:02:48.189> got<00:02:48.430> really<00:02:48.549> interested<00:02:48.849> in<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.209> also

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
so I got really interested in that also

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.050 
so I got really interested in that also
noticed<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:51.220> could<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.519> lot<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.819> work

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
noticed that we could do a lot of work

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.729 
noticed that we could do a lot of work
on<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.269> motors<00:02:52.569> get<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> lot<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.230> horsepower<00:02:53.500> on

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
on the motors get a lot of horsepower on

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.089 
on the motors get a lot of horsepower on
the<00:02:53.829> motors<00:02:54.129> but<00:02:55.090> do<00:02:55.599> a<00:02:56.139> few<00:02:56.590> things<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
the motors but do a few things to the

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.920 
the motors but do a few things to the
suspension<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.879> improve<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.329> lap<00:02:58.510> time<00:02:58.780> is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
suspension and improve the lap time is

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.240 
suspension and improve the lap time is
more<00:02:59.169> working<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> suspension<00:03:00.010> than

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
more working on the suspension than

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.580 
more working on the suspension than
working<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.639> motors<00:03:00.939> so<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:02.290> really

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
working on the motors so that's really

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.229 
working on the motors so that's really
where<00:03:02.739> it<00:03:02.859> works<00:03:03.370> which<00:03:03.639> for<00:03:03.819> me<00:03:03.909> we<00:03:04.060> actually

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
where it works which for me we actually

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.119 
where it works which for me we actually
did<00:03:04.510> both<00:03:04.689> for<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> long<00:03:05.169> time<00:03:05.409> and<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.099> I

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
did both for a long time and that I

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.940 
did both for a long time and that I
really<00:03:06.510> dropped<00:03:07.510> doing<00:03:08.109> on<00:03:08.230> motors<00:03:08.590> actually

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
really dropped doing on motors actually

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.319 
really dropped doing on motors actually
has<00:03:09.040> other<00:03:09.220> people<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.000> work<00:03:10.150> with

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
has other people do it and work with

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.849 
has other people do it and work with
some<00:03:10.450> really<00:03:10.629> good<00:03:10.750> companies<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.439> they'll

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
some really good companies and they'll

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.869 
some really good companies and they'll
totally<00:03:12.310> focus<00:03:12.669> on<00:03:12.760> suspension

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.490 

well<00:03:18.879> that<00:03:19.239> was<00:03:19.950> kind<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.040> part<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:22.500> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
well that was kind of part of that you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500 
well that was kind of part of that you
know<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.800> whole<00:03:24.069> process<00:03:24.670> back<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.269> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
know that whole process back in the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.180 
know that whole process back in the
early<00:03:25.810> day<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.590> college<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
early day of going to college and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
early day of going to college and
working<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.640> motors<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.750> had<00:03:28.840> some

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
working on motors and actually had some

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.670 
working on motors and actually had some
customers<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.739> were<00:03:29.830> friends<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.340> mine<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
customers that were friends of mine and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.839 
customers that were friends of mine and
ended<00:03:32.680> up<00:03:32.769> working<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.430> guy<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.730> owns

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
ended up working for the guy that owns

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.360 
ended up working for the guy that owns
Saddleback<00:03:34.330> Park<00:03:34.599> at<00:03:35.170> his<00:03:35.500> Yamaha<00:03:35.680> dealership

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
Saddleback Park at his Yamaha dealership

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
Saddleback Park at his Yamaha dealership
and<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.610> idea<00:03:36.819> was<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> build<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.230> performance

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
and the idea was to build a performance

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.800 
and the idea was to build a performance
portion<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> business<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
portion of the business and that

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.559 
portion of the business and that
actually<00:03:44.410> never<00:03:44.590> came<00:03:44.860> came<00:03:45.790> about<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:46.540> I

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
actually never came came about but I

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.900 
actually never came came about but I
worked<00:03:47.019> for<00:03:47.170> him<00:03:47.290> for<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> while<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.069> the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
worked for him for a while and and the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.150 
worked for him for a while and and the
friends<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.269> mine<00:03:49.530> asked<00:03:50.530> me<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.799> wanted<00:03:51.040> to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
friends of mine asked me if I wanted to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.259 
friends of mine asked me if I wanted to
go<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.370> business<00:03:51.489> with<00:03:51.849> him<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.120> we<00:03:52.209> were

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
go in business with him so we were

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.699 
go in business with him so we were
actually<00:03:52.540> business<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:52.989> partners<00:03:53.380> for<00:03:53.560> three

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
actually business as partners for three

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.580 
actually business as partners for three
years<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.430> then<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.420> went<00:03:55.630> off<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.810> my<00:03:56.170> own<00:03:56.200> in

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
years and then I went off on my own in

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:06.210 
years and then I went off on my own in
1984<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:59.280> started<00:04:00.280> race<00:04:00.430> day<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:06.040> thing

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
1984 and started race day the thing

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.670 
1984 and started race day the thing
about<00:04:06.430> about<00:04:06.790> motors<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.900> was<00:04:08.079> really<00:04:08.440> neat

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
about about motors that was really neat

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.949 
about about motors that was really neat
is<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.000> have<00:04:10.209> more<00:04:10.390> horsepower<00:04:10.930> more

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
is that if you have more horsepower more

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.780 
is that if you have more horsepower more
torque<00:04:11.230> everywhere<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.310> bike<00:04:12.489> doesn't

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
torque everywhere and the bike doesn't

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.020 
torque everywhere and the bike doesn't
blow<00:04:12.910> up<00:04:12.940> you're<00:04:13.780> good<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.610> have<00:04:15.790> more

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
blow up you're good if you have more

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.300 
blow up you're good if you have more
damping<00:04:16.540> or<00:04:16.720> more<00:04:16.900> spring<00:04:17.290> rate<00:04:17.500> you're<00:04:18.130> not

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
damping or more spring rate you're not

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.110 
damping or more spring rate you're not
necessarily<00:04:18.970> good<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.760> suspension<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> lot

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
necessarily good so suspension is a lot

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.850 
necessarily good so suspension is a lot
more<00:04:22.300> subjective<00:04:22.600> there's<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.200> bit<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.410> art

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
more subjective there's a bit more art

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.659 
more subjective there's a bit more art
in<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.880> science<00:04:25.300> of<00:04:25.740> suspension<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.950> as<00:04:27.460> far

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
in the science of suspension and as far

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.580 
in the science of suspension and as far
as<00:04:27.729> needing<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.479> learn<00:04:28.600> more<00:04:28.870> or<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.350> there

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
as needing to learn more or is there

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.650 
as needing to learn more or is there
more<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.860> learn<00:04:30.010> there<00:04:30.580> will<00:04:30.820> never<00:04:31.030> be<00:04:31.180> an<00:04:31.479> end

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
more to learn there will never be an end

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.659 
more to learn there will never be an end
on<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.260> one<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.830> it's<00:04:33.310> kind<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.550> one<00:04:33.639> of

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
on that one and it's kind of one of

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.980 
on that one and it's kind of one of
those<00:04:33.820> things<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.240> more<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.600> know<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
those things the more that I know the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.750 
those things the more that I know the
more<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.350> know<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> don't<00:04:35.979> know<00:04:36.220> you

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
more that I know that I don't know you

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.640 
more that I know that I don't know you
know<00:04:36.850> I've<00:04:36.970> worked<00:04:37.120> with<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.450> concepts<00:04:38.139> and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
know I've worked with the concepts and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.620 
know I've worked with the concepts and
really<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.669> more<00:04:39.850> that<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.030> understand<00:04:40.539> them

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
really the more that I understand them

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.000 
really the more that I understand them
the<00:04:40.750> more<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.960> know<00:04:41.080> there's<00:04:41.350> another<00:04:41.590> level<00:04:41.830> to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
the more I know there's another level to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.879 
the more I know there's another level to
understand<00:04:42.460> so<00:04:42.820> back<00:04:43.389> then<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.080> was<00:04:44.229> kind<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.590> a

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
understand so back then it was kind of a

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.670 
understand so back then it was kind of a
combination<00:04:45.639> of<00:04:46.060> ignorance<00:04:46.570> you<00:04:47.320> know<00:04:47.440> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
combination of ignorance you know and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.790 
combination of ignorance you know and
confidence<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.820> where<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.229> know<00:04:50.350> it's<00:04:50.530> like

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
confidence to where you know it's like

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.379 
confidence to where you know it's like
enough<00:04:51.070> ignorance<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.729> enough<00:04:51.910> confidence

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
enough ignorance and enough confidence

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.719 
enough ignorance and enough confidence
to<00:04:52.450> say<00:04:52.600> okay<00:04:52.840> let's<00:04:53.050> move<00:04:53.260> forward<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.919> the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
to say okay let's move forward and the

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.520 
to say okay let's move forward and the
biggest<00:04:55.270> thing<00:04:55.510> on<00:04:55.630> my<00:04:55.840> end<00:04:56.050> if<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.289> was

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
biggest thing on my end if it was

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.770 
biggest thing on my end if it was
understanding<00:04:57.310> business<00:04:57.600> you<00:04:58.600> know<00:04:58.660> as

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
understanding business you know as

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.779 
understanding business you know as
opposed<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.560> suspension<00:05:00.099> and<00:05:00.280> I've<00:05:00.610> been

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789
