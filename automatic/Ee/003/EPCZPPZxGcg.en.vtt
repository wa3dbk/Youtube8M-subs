00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.850
 so hi to all so these bass by 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.679
 peppers and twilight who is with me and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 we're on the studio pancake stand 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.250
 so I'm going to ask you to have some 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.589
 introduce you to present crop studio 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 so never at the elysée is therefore followed 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.470
 the author of crash studio crafts silly 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269
 it's a platform to create its 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.310
 own games 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.870
 the idea basically she comes down after I 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 am going to play minecraft I told myself he 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.719
 there is way to do something really cool 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 in fact with just blocks and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.620
 i always wanted to actually ben 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.879
 democratic video game creation 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 because it's so cool to do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.969
 games but it's super complicated and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.170
 so I also want low with blocks 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.760
 whoever can manipulate them 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 it's like lego it's super simple 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.469
 whose idiotic kraft is a platform 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.449
 which brings together a whole bunch of tools for 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 create characters based on blogs 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 created maps like on minecraft is 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.160
 then there is a script actor who has 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 painted to define the rules and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 so creating these games is then the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 little particularity besides that is that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.190
 in the same way as a game 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 multiplayer we can join on a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.160
 server and that they have changed his game 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.050
 in fact together live this is it 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.910
 and so we can then we can of course 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.290
 close his project for hbo it's just 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.520
 between friends but we can also leave 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.050
 the community would join us 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.050
 worked with strangers what 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.760
 I'm duck of 57 so I'm a 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.170
 fan of the first hour of crastes 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.930
 silly so it's thomas fric who got me 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.310
 presented the soft mattrick which is the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.410
 graphist who made this logo between 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 others so I had the opportunity to 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.990
 working with thomas who introduced me 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 kraft studio that's how I have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.110
 met elysée we sympathized and I 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 I launched in studio studio france.fr 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.850
 so a studio shoot france.fr that is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.980
 the site of the Francophone community of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.000
 kraft or just know how 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.100
 I 'm busy calling for com in 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.840
 English so that actually makes it that's 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.330
 super cool because they go they go 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.410
 take care of them to make accessible to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.250
 French I do not necessarily have the month 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.350
 time to take care of the part 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.760
 French all still here 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.230
 and for the future of your version of 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.149
 software what are you planning 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.470
 as novelties as implantation of 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.369
 new functions so so 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.380
 currently we are still in version 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.010
 alpha 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 then there are plenty of things planned 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.520
 still mostly there what what about 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.050
 bump for two months it's a language 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.060
 visual scripting ie 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.380
 that currently situates therefore define the 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.160
 time rules game with idiotic kraft he 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.350
 must type code 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.370
 it's a little against the concept of 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.020
 to say it's accessible to everyone 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.820
 so I actually worked on a system 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.930
 visual script based on blocks 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.350
 in fact you can quality blocks 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.120
 logical 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.310
 so it's much simpler you have the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.540
 request to drag drop actually 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.130
 blocks connected to each other 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.630
 so that should make her already a lot 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 more accessible after then for the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.000
 future down there is going to be lighting 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.080
 dynamic there is going to be an engine 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 physical is going to be full of little things 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.240
 we can add 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.130
 currently we will say we have the basics 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.660
 of the platform that are in place on 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.370
 can do games and now it's 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 a bath story added full stuff 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820
 nice that will simplify things 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.250
 another thing that I planned for example 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.670
 it's a bookshop slash stores 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 integrated 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.810
 so the idea would be to allow the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.370
 legs that creates a super nice model a 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.959
 set of animations and things like that 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.910
 to share them with the community in 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.800
 one with a small description page 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.019
 and so you love a 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.970
 kind of two places in which you can 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.830
 go dig for your game so it's up to 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.790
 bets to do everything based on zero bah 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.840
 you can go digging at this 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 character he's nice this thing to her 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 is nice and kill the attacks in your 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.480
 project and suddenly bah if you're not 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.650
 necessarily super good graphics other game 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 still do a nice thing like I 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.120
 had said in the beginning they said you 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 had said that it came from an idea of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.830
 minecraft is part of the example 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.080
 of exploitation and the contribution 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.240
 surin kraft beat develop further 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.380
 his projects improve it added 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.730
 other functions was for minecraft 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.980
 the minecraft modding 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.750
 where will stop there then I would like 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.280
 much to evolve the trick again to 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.230
 that level I talked a bit with 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.550
 minecraft developers the limitation 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.920
 current wholesale we will say is that 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.240
 they do not have a true template format 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.590
 very advanced on that animations 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.610
 it's a bit of code 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.310
 in minecraft good I pass you them 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.600
 details but the current wearer ex it 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.850
 actually allows to export a model of 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.470
 static idiotic kraft static without animation 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.210
 so we did something funny rigor 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.070
 is that I have a friend who made a 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.010
 star atheist of star wars 2 6 en bloc a 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.870
 huge thing and we replaced pigs 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.030
 of minecraft with the tat so we go them 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.470
 interests that roamed in ashes a 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.430
 big 1 everywhere and kind I took a 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.019
 saddle and I settled on my 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.330
 was an atheist I was wandering what it was 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.410
 very nice but hey that's cool 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.680
 but that's a bit limited to that for 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.910
 Nothing 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.650
 so as I said I discussed with 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 developers and with the support of 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.740
 modding etc 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.600
 they took a look at kraft you from the shot 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.770
 we are a priori they go they go 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.810
 add everything you need to have 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.270
 a correct model of animation and that's 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.060
 so then it would be already said 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.290
 where the zero level is going to say something that 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.270
 would be able to have animations 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.440
 nice and everything is so ideally this 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.150
 that I would love to do is downright 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.440
 may be able to provide a version 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.210
 special kraft idiots that would be a 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.919
 kind of two modding studios of 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.880
 minecraft be so I do not know it's going 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.780
 to be possible but it's something 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.529
 that I would really love to do 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.499
 to say that 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.639
 we will thank you and then I will 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.599
 wish a good continuation and then 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.599
 a good woman model then
