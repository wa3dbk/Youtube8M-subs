00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.010
 now we are going to teach you how to give 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.820
 maintenance to what are the hinges 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.449
 and the closures of any vehicle 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.449
 at home 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.169
 well let's use first of all 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.550
 a in this case is a clean charge can 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:42.480
 be any cleaning spray type 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 in spray we will proceed to clean it 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 The top 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 on the hinge 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.120
 now we let the liquid make 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.110
 your work dissolve any woman 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.720
 that evaporates and any residual that 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.350
 so we clean it with a cloth 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.350
 close paper towel 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.409
 and we continue with what is 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.369
 the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.369
 the lubrication 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.020
 with the spray in this case we're going to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.810
 use a synthetic grease spray 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.420
 that works penetrates in the first instance 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.550
 for the solvent and then makes its leave 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.550
 a movie with a special grease 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.420
 and so we're going to continue through all the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.630
 doors in this part of here is also 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 necessary a bit of any excess 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.420
 you have can not clean with a cloth 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.819
 with a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.819
 with a paper towel 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 now in this part of here that in which 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.900
 the main door 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.409
 we also use apply a little 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.409
 already 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.080
 and to finish in this closing that is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 the motor tone plate we are going to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.180
 apply already been we already did the same 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.620
 We apply the spray liquid in to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.620
 clean of clean coal 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.799
 and now we hope you want a little 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.170
 as we can already see the liquid the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.730
 dry cleaner spray then 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.900
 we proceed to apply a bit of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.900
 with the assistance of my friend alan 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.630
 in the bolt 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.030
 in the sheet 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.540
 and then that would be all they only clean the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.540
 excesses 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.260
 and ready to let it dry for a while and 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.120
 proceed to close and then open and 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.590
