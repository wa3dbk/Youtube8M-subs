00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.500
 on the menu of this mag yoghurt info 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.820
 cows happy and well treated 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.379
 poe products on the farm 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.050
 your opinion on dairy products 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.670
 fresh yogurt is it a story of 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.449
 farms and lighting a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.449
 dietician 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.739
 to make good milk a traitor is 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.899
 here it's essential but how does it 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.460
 concretely pass the explanations of 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.149
 dennis richards milk producers 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.180
 Burgundy 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.620
 firstly we will prepare the udder to 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.079
 using a disinfectant and a 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.970
 disused wipe then we go 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 check the first ones so i have them 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.780
 are going to be thrown on the floor to check 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920
 the sanitary quality of the milk see that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.170
 the animal is in good health 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.789
 after we will proceed to the removal of the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.039
 claw to extract the milk from the 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.869
 udder and then a stall 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.000
 automatic the future unplug the cow 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.250
 then we proceed to a news of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 udder infections to protect 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.110
 the country all day long 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.149
 thank you denis the next step so it's 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.470
 collection of raw milk and that's the 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.030
 sphere of laurent and drivers of 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 collection laurent you can us 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.409
 concretely describe this step what 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.729
 takes place in the following way so the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.159
 driver or whenever he arrives in the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.090
 yard of the farm so he gauges the volume 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.399
 of the tank 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.530
 he takes the temperature is then 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.479
 lift the lid so you look 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200
 if the milk is good and if it's not a 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.399
 suspicious smell 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.219
 once he's done repeating 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.140
 the operation they pump the tank and 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.579
 then once he's finished yves to 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.960
 their expressions following raw milk 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.579
 is a fragile material so it is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.909
 important to maintain the chain of 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:01:59.899
 cold 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.909
 so that's why we are 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.710
 equipped the isothermal truck in order to 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.700
 maintain a temperature below 4 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.700
 degrees throughout the collection 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.740
 some bacteria want me well 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.660
 they are called probiotics philippe 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.470
 hammer and professor in pathologies 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.760
 digestive 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.940
 he explains to us what a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 probiotic a probiotic this is a 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.080
 microorganism a bacterium in general 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.690
 sometimes a yeast that we ingest live 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.880
 and who by definition approved a 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.340
 efficiency for the one they swallow 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.840
 therefore a beneficial effect for man 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.240
 since we talk about the man we can 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.570
 use the properties of microbes 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.880
 ingested in a whole bunch of aid to the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.500
 digestion with intestinal comfort the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.050
 gastro enterologist scene that speaks to you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.640
 but also his microbes are perceived by 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.130
 the immune system that can 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 to adapt a little bit there are 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.890
 very interesting research in the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.620
 field of protection against 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.360
 infections for example an orca contains 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.790
 living bacteria and it was 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.890
 proved in clinical studies that these 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.470
 live bacteria help digestion 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.470
 yoghurt sugar, which is the lactose of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.480
 milk sugar so yes that meets the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 definition of a pro-biotic yoghurt 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 does it make yogurt fatter it's a 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.310
 food so always have to do 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.110
 pay attention to what you eat in quantity 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.160
 but the probiotics contained in no 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 do you know that the main 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.040
 probiotics are the ferments content 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.299
 in yogurt 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.830
 so what is a ferment 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.900
 concretely in the qualities 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.140
 nutritional and health tasting 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.910
 yogurts are closely related to these 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.489
 ferments ie elements 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.840
 specific is essential these are two 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.880
 micro organisms and only two 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.370
 stretches at caucus thermophilus voters 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.750
 Basque bulgaricus these two farms 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.530
 registering its bio that is to say that 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.090
 course of their growth 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.400
 they will benefit from each other 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.920
 and during the fermentation we go 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 first get an acidification followed 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.459
 an increase in viscosity and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.590
 finally a production of aromas 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.510
 characteristics of these products it is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.209
 the reason why the different 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.670
 laboratories manufacturing yogurt on 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.530
 have to choose very carefully 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.010
 the ferments so as to give their 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.079
 products 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.360
 the taste and texture they choose 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.640
 finally we can not finish without 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.700
 talk about the health effects of yogurt because this 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.650
 are the ferments that 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.540
 will allow people who are 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.910
 lactose intolerant to better digest 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.910
 the milk and lactose it contains 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.250
 yogurt 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.780
 I like shaves and yogurt to drink 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.240
 what can I do this supervisor 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.320
 nature brewed to no I eat rather the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.510
 close to the arm c1 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.760
 I prefer the past I prefer them 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.970
 yogurts farm I like well versed in a 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.610
 bar where the yurt to drink 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.380
 it is clear to everyone his yogurt then in 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.610
 what does this variety contribute to 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.979
 a good diet 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.080
 to find out direction the cabinet the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.760
 niet and issia nutritionist sophie 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.830
 thierry we can never say it enough 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.320
 lange and varied and have fun and 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.780
 one of the keys to a balanced diet 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.639
 and in that the yoghurt or rather the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.580
 yogurts are great candidates 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.010
 yogurt can be brewed 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.080
 liquid nature or sweet it can be 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.540
 also with fruit with pieces 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.970
 or 100 pieces colored nature 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.940
 there is something for everyone 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.370
 diversity of yoghurt is linked in part to 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.320
 the presence of ferment which directs the 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.360
 texture taste and aromatic profile 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.770
 yoghurt yogurt is also a 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.720
 very convenient food to eat at 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.889
 daily because it exists under a lot of 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.139
 versions that can be consumed at 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.720
 breakfast with goal cereals 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.340
 in the afternoon 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.640
 in small snack before going to 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.570
 sport or to taste it is also in 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.570
 end of meal for dessert
