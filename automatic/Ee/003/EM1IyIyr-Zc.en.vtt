00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.753
 Hi, I'm Stan Muller and this Crash Course World History series 

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:04.630
 Today we will talk about energy. 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.841
 I do not mean the energy of the crystal or the power of the Pyramids or even Red Bull, 

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.052
 I mean the energy people use to build pyramids 

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:12.763
 Or to manufacture crystals or to make energy drinks. 

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.014
 Hey! Where is Mr. Green? 

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.475
 Mr. Green is absent today and I am a substitute teacher. 

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:18.352
 An alternative teacher? Can we watch a video? 

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.520
 This is a video. 

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.907
 Today we will talk about the book "Children of the Sun" by Alfred Cruseby, 

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.535
 Who you may recall from our seminar on the Colombian exchange. 

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.120
 This is a Crusoe book about energy, which says: 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.040
 "Modern civilization is the product of wasteful energy ... 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.671
 But the appetites of humanity, which can not be satisfied with energy, make the solutions fleeting and the challenge permanent. " 

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.589
 This is not very promising. 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.342
 But before we begin to look at the history of human energy use, 

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.594
 Let us first talk about what we mean by energy. 

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.556
 For the purposes of our seminar, we will know energy as the force necessary to accomplish a job. 

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:59.977
 For more than 99 percent of human history, muscles were the primary source of energy for a job, 

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.270
 Whether human or animal. 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.273
 The fuel of those muscles is food, usually plants, 

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.567
 The plants get their energy from the sun in the end. 

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.946
 So, most of the energy used by humans comes from the sun in one form or another. 

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.990
 This is the name of the book Children of the Sun. 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.368
 Humans have many qualities, but "efficient power transformers" are not one of them, 

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.079
 That is why many jobs are needed. 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.164
 The construction of the Pyramids requires a lot of energy, for example, 

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.209
 It would not have happened without some technological developments using energy. 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.628
 The first energy technology is fire, 

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.882
 Our food made it possible to give us a greater variety of foods available 

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.758
 So, we gave more fuel to our muscles. 

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.553
 The fire also led to the start of metal works and improved tools. 

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:38.432
 Localization of flora and fauna was another notable development in energy. 

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:44.188
 By settling plants, humans have redirected the sun's energy to create more nutritious and energy-efficient food. 

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:48.066
 The sun also provided indirectly domesticated animals such as horses and bulls 

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.110
 Which has been harnessed to accomplish a more useful job. 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.615
 After the invention of agriculture, human energy developments stabilized for some time. 

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:57.826
 The only energy that we had and were not derived from the sun is hydropower, 

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.329
 Since the wind is actually produced by heating the sun for air, 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.165
 Sailboats and windmills are somewhat solar. 

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:08.170
 There have been small developments such as concentrating energy density of wood by converting it into coal 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.506
 Add oxygen to the fire using blowers, 

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:13.133
 But most of the energy was still born by the muscles. 

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.262
 The next major change in energy use occurred with manufacturing. Let's go to the fantasy bubble. 

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:22.309
 Manufacturing used new forms of fuel such as coal and then oil and natural gas. 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.396
 These fuels are very old forms of plant and animal fossilized materials. 

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.858
 So I say again, its origin is from the sun, but we do not think about it that way. 

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.652
 No one calls coal "solar". 

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:35.405
 For example, while Chinese used coal during the Song Dynasty to make iron, 

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.325
 England was the place where coal was really launched, thanks to the steam engine. 

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.410
 According to Cruzebi, it was the Newcoman steam engine 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.290
 "The first machine delivers significantly greater amounts of energy than is derived from muscle, water or wind." 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.918
 The manufacturing of the coal card was very great. 

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.546
 Britain was allowed to dominate the textile industry, 

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:53.006
 Production of weapons and ships operating industrial steam card 

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.593
 Enabled the Europeans to penetrate and dominate Africa and parts of Asia. 

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:01.765
 According to Cruseby, fossil fuels "created the political and economic landscape that we distinguish today." 

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.519
 After steam power, the transition to electric power occurred relatively soon thereafter 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.272
 It was used to supply machines for energy and lighting. 

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:11.525
 Electric light was very important because it provided a clean and efficient way 

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.151
 Allow people to work after dark. 

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.655
 Thank you bubble imagination. Although we may imagine coal as the fuel of the 19th century, 

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:20.117
 But we still use a large amount of it today, especially to generate electricity, 

00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.202
 But coal is much less effective than oil. 

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.248
 The latest oil revolution because it could supply energy not only to power stations, ships and trains, 

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.501
 But also to the internal combustion engine, making cars and trucks possible. 

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:34.006
 Cruzebe asserts that "the internal combustion engine that supplies the car, truck and tractor is powered 

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.259
 It was the most influential invention on Earth for a century. " 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.554
 By the end of the 20th century, there were half a billion cars in the world, 

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.974
 Humans used 70 million barrels of oil a day. 

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:47.352
 The manufacture and driving of all these vehicles has had a tremendous impact on the environment. 

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.770
 From the perspective of energy use, 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.357
 Since the beginning of the 20th century, the world has been a whole new era in human history. 

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:56.528
 We use electricity for everything in the West, they occupy our tools and light our homes 

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.156
 We traveled on trains, buses or cars. 

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.657
 Cruze describes the following: 

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.661
 "The use of basic energy for humans has increased 20-fold since 1850, 

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.914
 Then nearly five-fold since 1950. " 

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:11.376
 In the United States, each person consumed 2,000 kilowatt hours of electricity in 1950, 

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.879
 And 32,700 kWh in 2000. 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.299
 Oil and natural gas are the two most important fuels for this electricity boom, 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.929
 Since 2006, however, from 40 to 50 percent of people, most of whom live in the equatorial region, 

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.805
 They rely on wood as fuel to date. 

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.642
 When will oil out of the world is the subject of heated debate, 

00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:29.603
 But scientists have been looking for other forms of fuel for decades. 

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:33.398
 One alternative is nuclear power, and it has not been quite successful. 

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.945
 The first nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union opened in 1954, 

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:41.782
 Some countries, particularly France, continue to rely heavily on nuclear energy. 

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.077
 Despite the enthusiasm of scientists and the authors of science fiction at first, 

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:47.120
 But nuclear power is not known in the United States, 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.289
 In part because it is very expensive. 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.459
 Another problem is that no one can find out what to do with radioactive waste 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.044
 Produced by nuclear energy. 

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.296
 But the biggest reason for the failure of the spread of nuclear energy 

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.465
 Is because people think that nuclear power is serious, 

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.301
 They believe that nuclear plants can easily turn into giant bombs, 

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.222
 Or that depleted reactors will melt through the globe to reach China or the like. 

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.934
 In fact, most likely it will melt up to Australia or the like, 

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:10.102
 But you know what I mean. 

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:14.523
 But nuclear accidents really happened, most notably in Windskill in England in 1957, 

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:18.652
 And in St. Laurent in France in 1969, but neither was catastrophic. 

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.821
 The United States suffered a fear of a nuclear accident in 1979 

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.657
 With an incident on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. 

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.200
 Although there were no direct losses, 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.786
 However, thousands of people in the vicinity were forced to evacuate, 

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.372
 Cleaning took years and cost millions. 

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:34.960
 The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986 was much worse, 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.840
 With the launch of radiation hundreds of times stronger than those launched in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.593
 A nuclear crash would be fatal for 24,000 years. 

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:46.054
 Some countries still use nuclear power, but they have not actually been deployed. 

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:50.475
 In general, nuclear power has provided no more than five percent of the world's energy supply. 

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.437
 In recent years, there have been growing concerns about climate change 

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:57.441
 To increase appeals for humanity to find more clean and renewable forms of energy. 

00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.945
 The alternative seems to be to significantly reduce our energy consumption, 

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:05.115
 Especially as it would look like a historic step backwards. 

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:09.953
 History is often presented as a story of progress, growth and increasing complexity, 

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.956
 It is hard to imagine a future where we use less energy. 

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:18.253
 But historically, the world we live in is new, unsustainable and unnatural. 

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.755
 Kruseby shows us this reminder: 

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:24.468
 "Most of us in rich societies can only remember times of getting abundant energy. 

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:26.762
 We have enriched those abundance effectively 

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:29.681
 To think that there is energy traveling through wires from far away 

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.685
 Our rooms are illuminated when we move the key is natural and not miraculous. " 

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:38.440
 In the end, our way of reconciling our desire to continue our history of growth and increasing complexity 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.944
 And the fact that such growth is unsustainable with existing technology 

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:44.404
 Is one of the greatest challenges facing humankind today. 

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.992
 Whether or not we meet that challenge and how we do it will determine the kind of world we live in tomorrow. 

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.245
