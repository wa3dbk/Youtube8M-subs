him and he walks out on
you<00:06:49.090> guys<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:50.080> that's<00:06:50.170> one<00:06:50.380> thing<00:06:50.530> I<00:06:50.620> can<00:06:50.800> say

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
you guys so that's one thing I can say

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.080 
you guys so that's one thing I can say
John<00:06:51.790> Cena<00:06:52.120> doesn't<00:06:52.870> walk<00:06:53.140> out<00:06:53.260> on<00:06:53.410> his<00:06:53.530> pants

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
John Cena doesn't walk out on his pants

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.500 
John Cena doesn't walk out on his pants
so<00:06:55.090> that's<00:06:55.360> why<00:06:55.600> I<00:06:55.900> certainly<00:06:56.560> think<00:06:56.770> CM<00:06:57.100> Punk

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
so that's why I certainly think CM Punk

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.920 
so that's why I certainly think CM Punk
is<00:06:58.510> just<00:06:59.200> not<00:06:59.920> the<00:07:00.100> best<00:07:00.220> did<00:07:00.580> not<00:07:00.930> anything

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
is just not the best did not anything

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.870 
is just not the best did not anything
that's<00:07:02.260> why<00:07:02.380> I<00:07:02.410> also<00:07:02.560> think<00:07:02.890> John<00:07:03.070> Cena<00:07:03.100> is

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:03.880 
that's why I also think John Cena is

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.750 
that's why I also think John Cena is
better<00:07:04.150> than<00:07:04.360> CM<00:07:04.630> Punk<00:07:04.920> because<00:07:05.920> CM<00:07:06.400> Punk

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
better than CM Punk because CM Punk

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.280 
better than CM Punk because CM Punk
walked<00:07:07.510> out<00:07:07.720> on<00:07:08.580> his<00:07:09.580> fence<00:07:09.880> on<00:07:10.360> the<00:07:10.930> WWE

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
walked out on his fence on the WWE

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.980 
walked out on his fence on the WWE
Universe<00:07:12.540> so<00:07:14.040> that's<00:07:15.040> my<00:07:15.220> opinion<00:07:15.430> guys<00:07:15.990> I've

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
