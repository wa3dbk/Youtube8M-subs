with this rotation I found out when I
got<00:00:24.029> home<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.210> they<00:00:24.480> were<00:00:24.510> all<00:00:24.630> upside<00:00:24.900> down

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
got home that they were all upside down

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.400 
got home that they were all upside down
when<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> imported<00:00:26.369> them<00:00:26.460> into<00:00:26.519> Windows<00:00:27.390> 7<00:00:27.810> if

it's white bull Valley green beans and I

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.610 
it's white bull Valley green beans and I
just<00:03:05.970> added<00:03:06.120> proper<00:03:06.570> orientation<00:03:07.200> there<00:03:07.350> to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
just added proper orientation there to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.710 
just added proper orientation there to
distinguish<00:03:08.160> from<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> original<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.850> click<00:03:09.570> on

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
distinguish from the original I click on

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.050 
distinguish from the original I click on
that<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.019> play<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.350> will<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> video

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
that and play it will see a video

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.850 
that and play it will see a video
hopefully<00:03:12.390> here<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> proper

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
hopefully here that is in the proper

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.620 
hopefully here that is in the proper
orientation<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.880> there<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.269> is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
orientation and there it is

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.190 
orientation and there it is
proper<00:03:16.230> orientation<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:17.519> that's<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:18.780> can't

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
proper orientation and that's it I can't

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.570 
proper orientation and that's it I can't
recommend<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.830> program<00:03:20.120> highly<00:03:21.120> enough

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
recommend this program highly enough

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.670 
recommend this program highly enough
have<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> good<00:03:23.790> day<00:03:23.970> thanks<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:24.750> listening<00:03:25.080> bye
