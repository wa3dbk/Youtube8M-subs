street fighter for vanilla but what they

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
street fighter for vanilla but what they

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
did is optimize the matchmaking so that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.240 
did is optimize the matchmaking so that
you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.110> paired<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.650> other<00:01:04.860> people

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
with this new matchmaking and it really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
with this new matchmaking and it really
seems<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.189> better<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> think
