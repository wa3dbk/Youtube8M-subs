at being slightly on the pink side but
in<00:00:23.970> fact<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.130> Ducati<00:00:26.130> red<00:00:31.399> now<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
in fact it is Ducati red now there is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.840 
in fact it is Ducati red now there is
rust<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> couple<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> spots<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
rust and a couple of spots this is the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
rust and a couple of spots this is the
worst<00:00:36.090> sites<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.630> packed<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> Sun<00:00:37.440> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
worst sites I packed it in the Sun so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:50.660 
worst sites I packed it in the Sun so
you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:47.239> on<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.450> side<00:00:49.309> runs<00:00:50.309> along

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you can see it on the side runs along

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can see it on the side runs along
from<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
from there to there and it's about that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.340 
from there to there and it's about that
wide<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.379> crack<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:57.350> little

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
wide it's a little crack there a little

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.609 
wide it's a little crack there a little
bit<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.920> here

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:21.459 

otherwise<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:08.750> worst<00:01:09.020> side<00:01:20.469> it

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
otherwise this is the worst side it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.880 
otherwise this is the worst side it
might<00:01:21.679> be<00:01:21.859> a<00:01:21.890> little<00:01:22.429> spot<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.030> rust<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:24.200> or<00:01:24.829> a

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
might be a little spot of rust just or a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.340 
might be a little spot of rust just or a
bubble<00:01:25.369> just<00:01:25.670> down<00:01:25.969> here<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.539> can't<00:01:27.020> really<00:01:27.110> see

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
bubble just down here I can't really see

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.919 
bubble just down here I can't really see
it<00:01:27.409> very<00:01:27.530> well<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.630> side<00:01:35.929> is<00:01:35.990> mostly<00:01:37.479> okay<00:01:38.479> in

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
it very well this side is mostly okay in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:02:15.600 
it very well this side is mostly okay in
fact<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:39.349> pretty<00:01:39.679> much<00:01:39.770> completely<00:01:40.250> okay

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.410 

little<00:02:16.610> spot<00:02:16.879> just<00:02:17.239> there<00:02:18.220> slight<00:02:19.220> rub<00:02:19.640> there

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
little spot just there slight rub there

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.940 
little spot just there slight rub there
and<00:02:21.319> that's<00:02:21.620> caused<00:02:22.069> by<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:24.530> being<00:02:24.769> too

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
and that's caused by there being too

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:46.730 
and that's caused by there being too
much<00:02:24.980> play<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.879> here

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740

the door on that side the locking
mechanism<00:02:49.980> doesn't<00:02:50.730> work<00:02:50.910> anymore<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:53.280> just

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
mechanism doesn't work anymore it's just

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:07.060 
mechanism doesn't work anymore it's just
a<00:02:53.580> case<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> replacing<00:02:54.450> it<00:03:03.920> under<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> hood<00:03:05.959> it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
a case of replacing it under the hood it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.660 
a case of replacing it under the hood it
