00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.429
 the first or 3d in the paddling pool compared to this place 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.220
 who outside but 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.769
 for ten years 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.919
 in it 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.849
 that would not be so 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.319
 not all like that 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.319
 I am looking for a car 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 That is bitter 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 for people so dangerous St 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.260
 it will 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 Trust the world is not enough 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.240
 the court will 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.450
 that have one 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.620
 make a profit 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970
 m both will certainly hardly changed tendencies 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.410
 b should drive 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.650
 the excitement 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.330
 I'm not funny at all 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.510
 Now I want interest in British intelligence I'm just 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.390
 discounts 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.210
 against St 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.450
 this summer 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.160
 Timo Staffeldt is like that 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.310
 dtm races around the world 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 according to the ordinariate Bo 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.910
 makes 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.990
 it again 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 I expect you will not see it at the end of the day 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 I have to wait 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 the speech is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 ERA 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 move in again 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 I think the concept is really okay then 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 Halle Saale / mz 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.280

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.930
 the 2nd 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.320
