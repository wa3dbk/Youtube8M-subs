almost any vehicle on the road well I
see<00:03:27.579> one<00:03:27.730> other<00:03:27.880> thing<00:03:28.150> too<00:03:28.359> because<00:03:28.750> most<00:03:28.930> of

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
see one other thing too because most of

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.190 
see one other thing too because most of
us<00:03:29.230> also<00:03:29.859> fish<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:31.209> course<00:03:31.420> reels<00:03:31.690> cost<00:03:32.049> a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
us also fish and of course reels cost a

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.470 
us also fish and of course reels cost a
lot<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.680> money<00:03:32.829> but<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.670> think<00:03:33.970> even<00:03:34.150> more<00:03:34.420> so

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
lot of money but I think even more so

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.360 
lot of money but I think even more so
about<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.139> rods<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.650> can't<00:03:35.920> tell<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.220> how<00:03:36.280> many

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
about the rods I can't tell you how many

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.460 
about the rods I can't tell you how many
rods<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:37.060> broke<00:03:37.420> by<00:03:37.690> putting<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.139> in<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.290> back

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
rods I broke by putting it in the back

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.319 
rods I broke by putting it in the back
of<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.739> rig<00:03:38.950> closing<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.579> on<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.880> doing<00:03:40.150> whatever

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
of a rig closing it on it doing whatever

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.509 
of a rig closing it on it doing whatever
so<00:03:40.780> reality<00:03:41.319> is<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.620> probably<00:03:41.829> if<00:03:42.190> you're<00:03:42.310> like

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
so reality is is probably if you're like

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.280 
so reality is is probably if you're like
me<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.910> investment<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:43.810> one<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.049> these<00:03:44.139> is

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
going to pay for itself just in broken

the<00:04:29.160> touch<00:04:29.250> let<00:04:29.970> me<00:04:30.090> ask<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.450> this

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the touch let me ask you this

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.200 
the touch let me ask you this
this<00:04:31.980> looks<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.460> fairly<00:04:32.850> intricate

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
this looks like a fairly intricate

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.020 
this looks like a fairly intricate
locking<00:04:33.930> system<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.530> you've<00:04:34.710> got<00:04:34.920> there

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
locking system that you've got there

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.930 
locking system that you've got there
I<00:04:36.110> assume<00:04:37.110> this<00:04:37.350> locks<00:04:37.950> with<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> key<00:04:38.730> or

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I assume this locks with a key or

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.790 
I assume this locks with a key or
something<00:04:39.120> also<00:04:39.600> if<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.560> this

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
something also if you have this is this

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.220 
something also if you have this is this
is<00:04:41.010> our<00:04:41.220> vector<00:04:41.790> lock<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.660> we<00:04:42.810> use<00:04:42.990> these

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
is our vector lock and we use these

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.410 
is our vector lock and we use these
exclusively<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.640> extreme<00:04:45.060> all-weather

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
exclusively on the extreme all-weather

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.140 
exclusively on the extreme all-weather
series<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.380> way<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.680> works<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.310> as<00:04:47.550> you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
series and the way this works is as you

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.150 
series and the way this works is as you
close<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.750> drawer<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:50.480> lock<00:04:51.500> pulls<00:04:52.500> against

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
close the drawer the lock pulls against

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.710 
close the drawer the lock pulls against
the<00:04:53.280> bulb<00:04:53.520> seal<00:04:53.960> here<00:04:54.960> which<00:04:55.740> then<00:04:56.570> creates<00:04:57.570> a

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
the bulb seal here which then creates a

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.950 
the bulb seal here which then creates a
seal<00:04:57.990> against<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.620> inner<00:04:59.220> drawer<00:04:59.670> face<00:05:00.030> to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
seal against the inner drawer face to

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.659 
seal against the inner drawer face to
create<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.470> watertight<00:05:01.860> seal<00:05:02.310> from<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
create that watertight seal from the

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.780 
create that watertight seal from the
front<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.860> basically<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.040> is<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> key

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
front and basically this is a key

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.240 
front and basically this is a key
operated<00:05:06.720> lock<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.440> then<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.980> have<00:05:08.130> an

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
operated lock and then you have an

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.380 
operated lock and then you have an
additional<00:05:09.230> safety<00:05:10.230> feature<00:05:10.620> with<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:12.120> pull

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
additional safety feature with a to pull

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.760 
additional safety feature with a to pull
out<00:05:12.540> rings<00:05:12.810> here<00:05:13.110> where<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.380> can<00:05:13.500> put<00:05:13.680> an
