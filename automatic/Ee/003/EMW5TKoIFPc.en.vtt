 to the center of the city but due to the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.860
 speeding lost control of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 the motorcycle climbing to the lining 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.629
 and overturning crashing his head against 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.440
 a concrete pot that is part 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440
 of urban equipment 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.000
 we went up this is a call 11 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.130
 at night they have half an hour to 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.890
 we received the call but to the country of 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.989
 accident was on October 30 night 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.950
 happens that what happens to license is 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.640
 an accident of a motorcyclist at 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.790
 look like speed access a skid 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.680
 of 25 meters it is clear that falling 16 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.930
 meters ahead motorcycle room 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.260
 lost control was president in the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.530
 control and this one sticks a lot to the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:26.060
 garrison and that causes him to lose 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.760
 control of the unit and it skids where 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.280
 the body remained the motorcycle still 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.940
 it was 16 meters if the bike is still 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 16 meters away from where 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.880
 the motorcyclist this falls in this case it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.520
 presume he was driving something fast he 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.470
 person the speed of this the truth 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.870
 what happened to me to probably take this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 the mileage on the motorcycle but 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.750
 but this was a speeding 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.450
 Body lifting is already done 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 even the medical examiner came the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.320
 determination of the cause of death or 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.120
 what is coming this is what will do 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.670
 that necropsy precisely and we're going 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.200
 for there to be practiced is of 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.540
 according to the first investigations 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.030
 it is an accident and not a 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.830
 run over since the motorcycle does not 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.990
 presented blows from some other unit 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.970
 so there would only be one 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.280
 record of facts said in interview 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.930
 that go ephraim cordoba supervisor table 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.390
 of public prosecutors' agencies in the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.190
 northeastern zone who came to perform 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.140
 the corresponding procedures 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.880
 if it seems to be a record of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.300
 facts there is no crime that 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.510
 pursue apparently not 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.850
 on the motorcycle it did not show signs 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.250
 that he had been beaten not the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.040
 blows you have especially for the one of 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.230
 rap and that of the beats that is coming 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.240
 giving with the guard tion this is this 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.860
 part of the procedure we do 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.870
 the corpse removal together with the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 medical doctor for later 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.690
 move to the amphitheater and practice 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.540
 action of character of law so that is what 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.460
 that it is presumed that some 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.580
 accident a speeding loses 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.060
 control in the driver and this one and what 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.250
 that causes its fall 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.850
 if you hit it in a pot it is 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.340
 dies here at the scene 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.020
 the person died instantly because 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.810
 to severe cranioencephalic trauma 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.330
 because he was not wearing a helmet assuming 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.270
 he lost control since he was carrying 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.610
 a small dog which was found 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.520
 between his clothes still alive and it was 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.190
 delivered to his wife who recognized the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.590
 body if this is how it is recognized by the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.830
 same husband tells us that whoever 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 called sixtus jesus ruiz river herrera he 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.080
 It is apparently 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.480
 speaks of 59 years old 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.370
 this native of the warrior state and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.340
 neighbor here from here since 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.120
 I had been living for years, who did not 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.569
 we ignore this we are barely in the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.459
 start of this investigation the accident 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.540
 it could be because the excess of 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.409
 speed 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.630
 on the bike touches the lining that 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.270
 it makes you lose control 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.330
 and I think that is what causes this 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.160
 death of that person commented the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.160
 paramedics who brought an animal in 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.550
 load that brought a puppy here in the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.580
 chest in his clothes if he already 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.680
 we deliver to his wife if he goes alive 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.030
 animal and the animal was alive on 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.490
 case it could be that also 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.190
 possibly caused him to lose 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.360
 we still know not no, the truth can be 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.360
 presume a situation like that 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.069
 this is how it is stable the fact is not 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.500
 as not like this is we are attending 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.600
 this 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.600
 of sbc news 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.560
 and so it has been
