00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.189
 hey very good kids that such as 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 you are welcome guys again 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.180
 channel welcome to a video of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.710
 Call of Duty advanced information 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.080
 warfare today the truth that I have compiled 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 a lot of information so 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
 we go fast because then with these 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.260
 two break box games so short that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 I bring you in this case with the mmc in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.710
 milk down because it almost does not give me 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.539
 time to tell you everything and I want 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.310
 leave it this time everything pretty clear already 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 that fuck I bring enough things the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.270
 really very interesting first of all 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 let's start with something that does not 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.319
 reference to multiplayer but good is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.449
 very important and is that practically in 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.670
 the last hours confirmed the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.889
 existence in a cooperative way in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.879
 call of duty to the tan suwar farc is no 

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:44.699
 has nothing to do with the multiplayer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.710
 It is obviously a cooperative and has 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.780
 come out this image is worth this image that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.370
 we see here where we can 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.589
 start to speculate one of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.609
 co-founders has published it and we can 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.129
 start saying it's going to be 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.399
 survival with advanced technology 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.049
 how the exoskeletons can be me 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.459
 I know dinosaurs is what we can say 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.710
 anything but to me personally 

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:08.619
 what I can see the image 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 those three silhouettes of the center could 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.000
 be like costumes if you notice the one of the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.190
 right it looks like a penis is 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 research has now and it seems 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.880
 a fucking but I will tell you how he has 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.009
 this image came out because I thought 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.070
 quite curious tells you such a 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.399
 disappointment so appealing to michael condrey 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.710
 you should accidentally post a 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.960
 blurred photo of the cooperative mode of 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.780
 advanced warfare and the bastard michael 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.460
 condrey this one says vale oops and publishes 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.229
 this photo the truth that the uncle has 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.789
 taken very well the one located at the foot 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.170
 of the letter what is blurred because 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.670
 you do not see a shit and the penis of the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410
 right that just gave account then I 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.000
 it's pretty good, guys 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.649
 seriously what information can we extract 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.050
 of this then that evidently goes to 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.179
 have cooperative mode in call of duty to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.320
 trans warfare and good now go then 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.149
 let's move on to multiplayer 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.780
 because practically the image can be 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.039
 extract very little information simply 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.390
 speculations on a personal level the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.670
 multiplayer yes that I bring you enough 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.100
 things that can no longer make us 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.780
 idea well this information from 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.060
 multiplayer I want to make clear that he has 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.530
 come out of a beta test ie a man 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.930
 who has had access 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.910
 will play the game a little bit before and well 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.800
 they have let him publish all 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.170
 this information as well as your opinion 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.180
 staff about what you have tried in 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.090
 first place this kid ensures that the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.190
 Gameplay is faster and the game goes 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.220
 as much more fluid than other cars 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.540
 worth something very interesting news 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.120
 interesting that I liked a lot 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.910
 home he said he rewards a lot 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.670
 the personal skill of each player 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.030
 there being a big difference between 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 good players and bad players 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.600
 he also said that there is so much difference 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.850
 that the players that really leave 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.550
 play this game well they are going to massacre 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.540
 what played bad players 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.340
 personally I like this a lot because 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.989
 I think a coach always has to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.120
 do from the point of view I've already 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.709
 said several times in my videos from 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.510
 the point of view of the players that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.640
 they really know how to play you can not do 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.989
 a kot helping people who do not 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.000
 you know how to play those people you have to 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.190
 accustom and improve you can not put 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.650
 as many facilities as many can 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.370
 a lot of scott we've seen so far 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.769
 for example streaks d 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.349
 and when you die progressively not 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.260
 I know a lot of things and this is pretty 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.959
 interesting helping the class that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.269
 receives the name of the class they are like 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.069
 what is called heavy weapons 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.079
 it's quite confusing because you say it's worth 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.690
 the heaviest thing so we 've had up 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.220
 now they are light machine guns and 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.220
 however they have the name of light 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.140
 if they are really called heavy weapons it is 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.030
 because they refer to his name is worth 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.129
 but you ask yourself in such a way that you go 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.319
 that we're going to have a turret there 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.060
 the hand I do not know that's enough 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.950
 interesting because it's a class with 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.690
 heavy weapons but what the fuck is going to be 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.220
 that's good, we'll see this, yes it's 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.980
 interesting to this is what I want to see 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.920
 and a series of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.400
 skills that the exoskeleton has and 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.019
 are the following a kind of 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.120
 invisibility referring to a form 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.480
 to hide that they can not see the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.640
 enemies super strength super jump and that 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.959
 lateral displacement these last 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.849
 well actually the four the 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.630
 we could already deduct from trailers 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.760
 but let's say that those super things 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.980
 super jump force of sen 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 in other things like for example the super 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.030
 force is talking about maybe you can 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
 because you say it's worth the super strength 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.230
 but how am I going to be able to apply that to 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.060
 multiplayer of this game then of the 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.380
 next way you talk about a super 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.720
 punch that is until now we have 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.640
 always had the option of stabbing 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.689
 of killing enemies like a cracked 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.339
 well maybe 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.199
 this time in this game then 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.389
 we can punch the enemies 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.799
 and we send them to take for ass I do not think 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.959
 that super strength can be used 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:51.489
 to take a car and throw it to the 

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:54.099
 enemies because that would be already very heavy 

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:55.569
 so then it is talked about the super 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.599
 punch that is called way pretty 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.369
 curious then also the super jump will 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.589
 has also spoken that there is a combo 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:04.899
 that makes the super jump very good and 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.360
 let's say a small explosion like wave 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.279
 expansive that you do when you fall if you make 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.860
 the super jump this way to the best 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.860
 we jump and we can fall to an enemy 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.449
 almost over and kill me 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.029
 I like quite a lot of guys because they are 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.399
 trying to remodel practically the 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.779
 multiplayer in its entirety are worth 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.269
 the first ones that really are 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.739
 risking to really change it to 

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.629
 do really different things from 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:30.939
 done in this interview with this kid 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.439
 He also assures him that it is the 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.479
 multiplayer that differs most from the 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.849
 old scott and me as I tell you we're 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.909
 and 10 deliveries and this needs a change 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:43.000
 brutal to really enhance the saga 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:45.280
 colony and finally they have said that 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.840
 he likes second second combat 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.940
 that is to say that in the multiplayer of this 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.280
 game you're always going to have a goal 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.740
 you will always have something to do and that 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.600
 they want to raise something in the multiplayer 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.060
 as well as the experience that is lived in 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.250
 campaign that second second you're killing 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.560
 second second enemies are going having 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.030
 an objective so I do not know what you think 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.920
 from you to the best what most 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.450
 scary is the issue of invisibility and 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.160
 such but good these people have already said 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.140
 that all the multiplayer will be very 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.030
 balanced I do not know that the 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.580
 personal skill new things like the 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.320
 super force is the super punch this 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.790
 that will be quite curious to see and 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.650
 apart, it has also been confirmed by 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.300
 another side that is going to see the existence of 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.250
 a cooperative mode so I 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.930
 personally to date and I've already 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.090
 reflected in a lot of videos I keep 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.070
 trusting this preserve fully and 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.350
 I hope that this year we live with this year 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.690
 and the next what it takes for us to live 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.669
 a fantastic coach and we do not have 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.110
 that talk back costs so nothing 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.820
 guys I hope you liked this 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.230
 call of duty information video 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.330
 advanced warfare I would appreciate a 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:47.340
 heap that you gave him a mega like and nothing 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.340
 see you in the next video bye bye 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.000
 depended on a penis the image is that
