00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.260
 here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.340
 the world of wine is very easy not 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.970
 we have to look like a friend more in 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.190
 our house we do not complicate we are going to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.949
 Give them a few tips to make it more 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.160
 nice and enjoyable this game of 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 pairing in the houses remember please 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.660
 that the white wines the rosÃ© wines 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.590
 they should go to cold temperatures 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.390
 that oscillate between 6 and 8 degrees does not 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.090
 they will complicate if they do not have the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.399
 adequate thermometer simply you 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.040
 You must see that the bottle is sweating 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.829
 on the outside they will also ask 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.960
 then how long should I leave it 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.899
 in the fridge if you have it from the day 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.960
 previous would be regal to have it there 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.820
 in the refrigerator and the next day well 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.379
 be it lunch time or lunch 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.770
 at the moment they are going to uncork it 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.650
 they can take it out if the visit came to them 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.790
 suddenly do not worry what can they 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.120
 put on it 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
 cold in the freezer one or two hours 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.380
 before if the visit arrived 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.090
 there is also the solution 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.670
 we are going to have a vat or a bucket where 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.190
 We will have the following order which 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.370
 it is very important they are going to place the 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.770
 bottle inside a bucket or a bucket 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.590
 ice they're going to put a lot of ice 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.680
 around the bottle then they go to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.560
 catch salt and hopefully enough salt they will 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.810
 put on the ice this in order 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.600
 that the ice is preserved for more 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.540
 time and over we will put the water 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.530
 there they leave it for 20 minutes or 15 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.630
 minutes another curious fact I recommend you 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.270
 put with gum paper that is the paper 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.509
 that sticks or if they do not have this paper 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.060
 a plastic bag because with the salt 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.700
 bottle is going to look very ugly is when the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.100
 withdraw from the tank they simply remove it 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.620
 the plastic paper or the sachet in the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.380
 which they put so that the label does not 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.680
 rise red wines 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.100
 see the back label it's going to say 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.860
 consumed at a temperature of 16 or 18 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.490
 degrees many times we also saw each other 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.590
 say at room temperature but I 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.140
 I wonder at the ambient temperature of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.610
 that if I'm in a cold climate then the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.890
 room temperature is going to be 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 surely between 16 or 18 degrees 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.280
 but if I'm in a climate where we're going to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.680
 have temperatures of 35 or 40 degrees 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.010
 Well, the wine is going to have such an acidity 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.180
 strong in the mouth that will not be nice 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.270
 so this is why we recommend 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.580
 give a touch of cold a touch of cold 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.040
 It is not as cold as whites or 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.860
 pink but to take him down a little 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.870
 temperature so that alcohol is more 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.750
 soft to our palate and we can 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.610
 enjoy an excellent wine tim the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.000
 excess of alcohol is detrimental to the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.440
 Health 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.060
 prohibit the sale of beverages 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.060
 intoxicants minors 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.219
