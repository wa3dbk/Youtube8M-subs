00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi friends from youtube I bring you the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.390
 solution to the installation problem 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 microsoft office professional package 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.460
 plus in our version of windows 7 the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 people when we give you install now 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.520
 it throws us the error that says microsoft 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.030
 office professional plus 2010 has 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.610
 detected 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.260
 an error during installation this is 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.180
 because windows 7 has removed several 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.520
 registry keys to be able to get 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.800
 the windows 7 live version of what 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 makes it incompatible with several software 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.149
 and devices normally 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.430
 arrogarnos this error because it is because 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.200
 We decided to install now what we should 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 to do is to do an installation 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.270
 personalized of which when we 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 quit the almost installation we will give you in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.079
 customize once being in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 personalize 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.739
 we open 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.610
 the box that says characteristics 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.290
 shared office and we give in the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.400
 plus sign to display all 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.340
 the options 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.540
 being in all options 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.220
 we are simply going to deactivate the three 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.560
 following are the ones I have here 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.670
 marked off these three 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.340
 options we are going to do the following 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 we are going to return and we are going to 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 says office tools there we are going to 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 deactivate the first 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 and once this is done, normally the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
 installation will be done 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 correctly as we will see here the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.220
 installation is carried out with a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.340
 satisfactory success now it opens us 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.869
 for a negative result at the end ni 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.110
 so negative because it's something in the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.880
 spicy that we will simply omit is a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.950
 small mistake because I have not 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 found mesh log that is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 necessary to take the installation to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
 done correctly however if the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.520
 we went with the installation will be successful 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 in the same way once done this can 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.350
 be installed correctly and I hope that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210
 like the video friends this video is 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.130
 an improved video because the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.739
 previous that you make on this same 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.260
 case in the audio quality was not 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.440
 100% liquid and they asked me to do 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.940
 again the video I'm doing 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.500
