00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Welcome to my alternate universe. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.890
 world and today I will talk about beers erc 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.890
 here we go 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:24.859
 the cat plus ten creches voice sieve 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859
 test 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.619
 somehow I think I was was a 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.300
 of the few people who bought a 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.670
 cradle war is that without realizing that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.100
 Have you seen an anime I've come from? 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.989
 I thought it was the sinister manga 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 It turns out that I 'm glad he 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.370
 I had a familiarity that I liked 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.829
 when conan common beings faced 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.750
 things beyond them a motivation that moves 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.699
 the warrior a dense and clear history to 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.510
 barbarity of the human being placed as 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.729
 she is 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.949
 this realizes that it is not an exercise 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.110
 in bad taste is not just violence 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.729
 physics and morality in history 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.930
 we accompanied a big swordsman 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.879
 lonely 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.339
 the man who never knew anything good 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.629
 Throughout his life he travels through 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.229
 a medieval world that was until then 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.850
 common for the time though in the beginning 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.790
 few precious details are 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.409
 revealed about his childhood and face in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.380
 It was horrible for you to have an idea. 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.000
 he was born of a corpse and this was not 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.610
 the worst thing that happened to him 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.049
 if it was only very good always great 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.570
 carry the sword of proportions 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.369
 ridiculous and this has explanation he 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.450
 grew up training with the sword always 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.340
 bigger than him 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.289
 every year he grew older then 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.659
 swapped his sword for a larger sword 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.460
 current large is very closed to 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.920
 any kind of socialization does not 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.390
 supports being touched by other people and 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.100
 it carries more than attitude the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.590
 enough to face a troop of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.810
 Soldiers alone 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.969
 and the more we say legal character 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 is the GAMT there is no agreement with 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.780
 any definition of right and wrong in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 instead it operates within an area 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 gray in your mind your actions still 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.719
 plus their motivations 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.399
 leads you to commit any act there is 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.649
 new respirators on heroism 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.869
 protect the innocent here 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.280
 instead it is driven by your 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.920
 own desire for revenge and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.890
 survival and survival is not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 easy task on your walk and battles 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.730
 As a great mercenary, he encounters a 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.849
 flock of the hawk led by 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.980
 charismatic graphite boarding school and so 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.450
 beautiful that looks like a capable girl 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.579
 do anything to get the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.620
 who wants anything at all? 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.420
 the gent reaches the bank of the hawk yet 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.540
 very young and inexperienced 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 situation facing griffith see 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.209
 a trump card to make the bank of the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.530
 hawk to be recognized by the nobles 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.540
 greenpeace wants to be a king practically 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.790
 and for this he needed soldiers who 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.560
 would provide such a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.500
 so he defies big without a bet 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.060
 big case lose duel would become 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.109
 Your doll forever to do. 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.209
 anything 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.720
 the battle was nearly balanced almost 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.560
 before the pure force chairlift this until of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.090
 lightness 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.519
 the battle ends with great being 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.889
 defeated say the force you go 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.500
 understand when you were big accept 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.560
 and honored the bet and from there he was 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.099
 a new graphite bug 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.440
 years pass large met several 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.090
 members of the hawk flock as the bark 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.110
 a girl who wants to taste like 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.599
 strong warrior 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.550
 even though the woman is the yoga woman who only 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.110
 because it is the favorite flu thing 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.940
 She wanted to be a car that is 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.340
 responsible for making big choices 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.130
 emotionally thing that is very difficult 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.830
 happen sooner did the falcon bank 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.599
 give a gigantic level up the tactics of 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.000
 flu and the strength and determination that 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.050
 before a pack they made them 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.180
 recognized 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.180
 to the point of becoming crown guard 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.150
 and as you know the whole kingdom has 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.920
 someone envious that has a plan for 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.989
 to screw someone I'll tell you that almost 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.480
 nobody mosquini see to be only have 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.010
 people and wishes and of course he does 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.099
 horrible things during the course of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.170
 plot not things of evil but things 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.910
 questionable for today's society 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.769
 the more you go deeper into the past 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.590
 character is shown because they 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.849
 they are what they are and gates is only one piece in the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.580
 game 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.920
 He loved the grid he makes everything has part 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.489
 What do you say, man, how he did it? 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.560
 it's a dog do not misunderstand me the graphite 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.130
 not a bad person but he plays for 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.570
 win 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.180
 there are things he does for the band that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.340
 Shock I will not speculate this anymore. 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.570
 who has read or who will read will understand the 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.150
 what do you see? 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.030
 the goose is a character who is the first 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.229
 point is empty but it's my favorite 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.180
 for he is very respected 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.620
 psychologically the world broke him 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.139
 It takes too long to present your world 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.450
 first bow the golden age shows a lot 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.040
 bit of the supernatural and I think that 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.310
 legal human conflict is fine 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.690
 exploited is like a circle of hatred and 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.910
 when they witness the supernatural 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.070
 You feel shaken because it takes time for 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.160
 happen and who reads if you have any idea 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.930
 It's realizes how surprised I am. 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.560
 a new universe created for those 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.480
 characters and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.560
 The more you read the more you 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.720
 tape of that 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.650
 the work evolves it transforms realize that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.479
 is a presenter and no one gets out of it 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.310
 I think cradle is when the most things 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.229
 cool that I was able to break a 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.850
 novelty for me who is in the eye created 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.740
 a different world even though some 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.139
 clichÃ©s of fantasy stories 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.250
 You notice that you cling to the smallest details if 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.919
 Do you like intriguing stories? 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.169
 Heavy topics that you like to see 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.910
 Okay, I'll see you there, thanks. 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.770
 very worthwhile also have three movies 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.720
 adapting the golden era but are 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.970
 if they want to enjoy this 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.460
 story in a manga or anime watch 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.710
 that stopped at the end of the golden era also 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.229
 but it is very good he passes the sensation that 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.060
 pass near here he takes you to the 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.310
 hell 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.650
 will be published by panini here in the 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.720
 Brazil but find a manga from the number 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.449
 1 is very complicated and expensive 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.250
 I recommend that you read this online well 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.350
 was a bit of the alternative universe of 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.229
 my world if you like crush the button 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.330
 I liked it below as if remembering that 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.800
 this picture is not just about manga 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.260
 It could be about anything I 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.180
 I think it's cool until documentaries 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.349
 good, this is what I hope people have 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.349
 liked and until the next
