00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
can tell we actually fixed that by

can tell we actually fixed that by
having<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:19.609> run<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> cycle<00:00:21.449> through<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.689> couple

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
having it run and cycle through a couple

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.340 
having it run and cycle through a couple
heat<00:00:22.199> cycles<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.779> anyways<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.199> I've

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
heat cycles so anyways right now I've

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.660 
heat cycles so anyways right now I've
got<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> bike<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.849> starts<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.670> it's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
got the bike so it starts up and it's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.890 
got the bike so it starts up and it's
still<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.119> I'm<00:00:30.420> linked

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
still not I'm linked

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.209 
still not I'm linked
correctly<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:33.620> we'll<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.950> still

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
correctly it's but we'll see I'm still

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.950 
correctly it's but we'll see I'm still
tweaking<00:00:35.399> away<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.329> still<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> long

tweaking away at it I still got a long
ways<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.770> whole<00:00:37.890> tweaks<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
ways to go on the whole tweaks so I

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
ways to go on the whole tweaks so I
don't<00:00:40.559> know<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.860> could<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.629> but

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
we've got a mirror-like finish except

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
we've got a mirror-like finish except
for<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.090> scrape<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.750> there

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
for that little scrape right there

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
for that little scrape right there
we<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> mirror-like<00:00:47.460> finish<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
we got a mirror-like finish on this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.110 
we got a mirror-like finish on this
bearing<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> other<00:00:49.200> bearing<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bearing the other bearing is in a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.350 
bearing the other bearing is in a
similar<00:00:51.510> state<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
similar state but it's actually in the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
similar state but it's actually in the
storage<00:00:54.780> unit<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.710> called<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> Porsche

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
anyway so first off the head gasket we

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.609 
anyway so first off the head gasket we
were<00:01:06.840> getting<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> little<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:10.290> were<00:01:10.380> getting<00:01:10.560> a

one drop every couple of seconds then
we're<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> rolling<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.780> no

clean<00:01:36.299> carbs<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.950> disconnected<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
clean carbs I actually disconnected the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.260 
clean carbs I actually disconnected the
X<00:01:39.030> system<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.200> plugged<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> cap<00:01:41.270> right

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
X system and plugged it with a cap right

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
X system and plugged it with a cap right
there<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> other<00:01:44.729> side<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
there and on the other side because it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
there and on the other side because it
was<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.369> causing<00:01:47.880> some<00:01:48.000> idle

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
was I think it was causing some idle

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
was I think it was causing some idle
problems<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> I'll<00:01:49.200> fix<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.680> later<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
problems and I'll fix that later and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
problems and I'll fix that later and
actually<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> still<00:01:51.299> need<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> sync<00:01:51.840> these

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually I still need to sync these

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
actually I still need to sync these

yeah but I haven't installed them yet

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.770 
yeah but I haven't installed them yet
along<00:02:16.709> with<00:02:16.860> some<00:02:17.040> other<00:02:17.130> stuff<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.480> let's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
along with some other stuff so let's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.479 
along with some other stuff so let's
start<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.140> bad<00:02:19.380> thing<00:02:19.620> up<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.280> been

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
start this bad thing up it's been

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.300 
start this bad thing up it's been
running<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:21.020> looking<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.170> 10<00:02:22.830> minutes<00:02:23.160> now

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
running for looking about 10 minutes now

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.500 
running for looking about 10 minutes now
so<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.390> actually<00:02:24.930> warm<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.060> zero<00:02:27.060> choke<00:02:28.370> and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so it's actually warm so zero choke and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:40.460 
so it's actually warm so zero choke and
power<00:02:30.510> on

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.080 

there<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:40.860> go<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.400> about<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> lowest

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
there we go this is about the lowest

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.510 
there we go this is about the lowest
I've<00:02:42.450> got<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.960> idle<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.280> says

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
I've got at the idle and as it says

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.940 
I've got at the idle and as it says
right<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:46.050> 1500<00:02:46.890> rpm<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:49.380> not<00:02:49.650> bad

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
right here is 1500 rpm that's not bad

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.520 
right here is 1500 rpm that's not bad
but<00:02:50.880> look<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.360> favoring<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.020> doesn't<00:02:52.350> like

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
but look it's favoring it doesn't like

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.160 
but look it's favoring it doesn't like
it<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.940> after<00:02:54.330> fixing<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.840> lot<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it and this is after fixing a lot of the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.690 
it and this is after fixing a lot of the
vacuum<00:02:55.620> leaks<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.980> we're<00:02:56.130> having<00:02:56.310> from<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
vacuum leaks that we're having from the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:06.430 
vacuum leaks that we're having from the
old<00:02:56.850> tubing<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.410> you're<00:02:58.710> building<00:02:58.860> cars

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.170 

we've<00:03:06.740> got<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.190> a<00:03:07.310> little<00:03:07.490> slow<00:03:07.790> return

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
we've got kind of a little slow return

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.150 
we've got kind of a little slow return
to<00:03:08.300> idle<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.080> then<00:03:09.680> she'll<00:03:09.890> die<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:15.170> think<00:03:16.070> I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
to idle and then she'll die so I think I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860 
to idle and then she'll die so I think I
need<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.490> mess<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.060> airfield<00:03:17.630> Vince

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
need to mess with the airfield Vince

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.410 
need to mess with the airfield Vince
you're<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.140> little<00:03:18.380> bit

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you're a little bit

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.480 
you're a little bit
and<00:03:19.750> take<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.530> carbs<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.280> might

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
and take the carbs and that might

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.340 
and take the carbs and that might
actually<00:03:21.760> solve<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.480> lot<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.660> our<00:03:22.870> problems

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
actually solve a lot of our problems

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.290 
actually solve a lot of our problems
here

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.730
