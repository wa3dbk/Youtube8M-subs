system your skin is silky smooth the
best<00:01:03.610> thing<00:01:03.880> about<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.360> salt<00:01:04.629> system<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.310> that

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
best thing about the salt system is that

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.690 
best thing about the salt system is that
it's<00:01:06.460> easy<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.060> use<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:08.520> time-saving<00:01:09.520> and

saves<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.570> lot<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.840> money<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:15.270> chlorine<00:01:16.270> and

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
saves you a lot of money on chlorine and

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.230 
saves you a lot of money on chlorine and
maintenance<00:01:16.900> chemicals<00:01:17.710> such<00:01:18.580> as<00:01:18.820> pH

maintenance chemicals such as pH
alkalinity<00:01:20.080> etc<00:01:20.860> these<00:01:21.700> are<00:01:21.760> what<00:01:22.090> we<00:01:22.270> call

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
alkalinity etc these are what we call

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.320 
alkalinity etc these are what we call
the<00:01:22.720> inexpensive<00:01:23.229> maintenance<00:01:23.650> chemicals<00:01:24.430> to

the inexpensive maintenance chemicals to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.719 
the inexpensive maintenance chemicals to
start<00:01:25.690> up<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:26.830> have<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.340> ph

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
start up you have to have your ph

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.060 
start up you have to have your ph
alkalinity<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.510> chlorine<00:01:29.020> at<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.740> correct

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
alkalinity and chlorine at the correct

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.149 
alkalinity and chlorine at the correct
levels<00:01:30.460> once<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.570> have<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.770> pour<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
levels once you have that you pour the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.539 
levels once you have that you pour the
salt<00:01:33.370> directly<00:01:33.940> into<00:01:34.750> your<00:01:34.900> pool<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.220> amount

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
salt directly into your pool the amount

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.000 
salt directly into your pool the amount
of<00:01:36.670> salt<00:01:36.970> depends<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.380> amount<00:01:38.620> of<00:01:38.710> gallons

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
of salt depends on the amount of gallons

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.680 
of salt depends on the amount of gallons
that<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.670> have<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.030> your<00:01:40.150> pool<00:01:40.420> for<00:01:40.659> example

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
that you have in your pool for example

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.190 
that you have in your pool for example
if<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.409> have<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.620> 20,000<00:01:42.520> gallon<00:01:42.880> pool<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
if you have a 20,000 gallon pool you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.710 
if you have a 20,000 gallon pool you
would<00:01:44.380> add<00:01:44.530> approximately<00:01:45.250> 16<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:45.790> 18<00:01:46.240> bags<00:01:46.479> of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
would add approximately 16 to 18 bags of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.820 
would add approximately 16 to 18 bags of
salt<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.880> usually<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.180> about<00:01:49.510> 8<00:01:49.900> bags<00:01:50.320> per

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
salt it usually is about 8 bags per

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.060 
salt it usually is about 8 bags per
10,000<00:01:51.670> gallons<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.210> water<00:01:52.650> this<00:01:53.650> is<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.920> only

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
10,000 gallons of water this is the only

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.700 
10,000 gallons of water this is the only
time<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.119> add<00:01:55.299> that<00:01:56.140> much<00:01:56.440> salt

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
time that you have to add that much salt

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.130 
time that you have to add that much salt
unless<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.369> drain<00:01:57.670> your<00:01:57.820> pool<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.840> start

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
unless you drain your pool and you start

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.219 
unless you drain your pool and you start
over<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.549> check<00:02:00.820> your<00:02:01.000> water<00:02:01.240> every<00:02:01.750> week<00:02:01.990> I'm

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
over you check your water every week I'm

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.590 
over you check your water every week I'm
like<00:02:02.710> using<00:02:03.010> granular<00:02:03.700> chlorine<00:02:04.150> which<00:02:04.420> you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
like using granular chlorine which you

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.590 
like using granular chlorine which you
have<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.900> check<00:02:05.110> everyday<00:02:05.500> or<00:02:06.030> tablets<00:02:07.030> which

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
have to check everyday or tablets which

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.350 
have to check everyday or tablets which
you<00:02:07.780> have<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.080> check<00:02:08.289> every<00:02:08.590> 2<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.769> 3<00:02:08.920> days<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
you have to check every 2 to 3 days you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.020 
you have to check every 2 to 3 days you
may<00:02:10.569> have<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.899> add<00:02:11.049> a<00:02:11.080> bag<00:02:11.470> or<00:02:11.680> two<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.790> and

may have to add a bag or two now and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
may have to add a bag or two now and
then<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.510> that's<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> depend<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
then and that's going to depend on the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.330 
then and that's going to depend on the
heat

system can be used on in ground pools
which<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.980> have<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.550> sample<00:02:31.970> here<00:02:32.420> or<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.769> can

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
which we have a sample here or you can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.130 
which we have a sample here or you can
use<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.459> above-ground<00:02:35.180> pools<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.900> now

use it on above-ground pools and now

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.430 
use it on above-ground pools and now
they<00:02:36.470> make<00:02:36.769> them<00:02:37.209> small<00:02:38.209> enough<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:38.599> spas<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
they make them small enough for spas and

they make them small enough for spas and
swim<00:02:39.830> spas<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.480> use<00:02:41.690> these<00:02:41.900> systems<00:02:42.440> on

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
swim spas you can use these systems on

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.430 
swim spas you can use these systems on
new<00:02:43.040> pool<00:02:43.310> installations<00:02:44.180> or<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:45.019> can<00:02:45.200> add

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
new pool installations or you can add

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.250 
new pool installations or you can add
them<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.830> existing<00:02:46.400> pools<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.000> there's<00:02:47.959> no

the<00:02:51.350> only<00:02:51.530> con<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> can<00:02:52.400> think<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the only con I can think of is that it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.380 
the only con I can think of is that it
costs<00:02:54.080> more<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.440> start<00:02:54.739> up<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.880> purchase

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
costs more to start up with a purchase

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
costs more to start up with a purchase
of<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.920> unit<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:59.420> course<00:02:59.660> purchasing<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
of the unit and of course purchasing the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.729 
of the unit and of course purchasing the
salt<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.690> savings<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.319> you're

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
and a lot of the maintenance chemicals

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.650 
and a lot of the maintenance chemicals
it<00:03:11.540> usually<00:03:11.959> pays<00:03:12.170> for<00:03:12.590> itself<00:03:13.120> by<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.150> second
