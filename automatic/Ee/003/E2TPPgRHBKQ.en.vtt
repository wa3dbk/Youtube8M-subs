00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the rattlesnake zoo one of the attractions 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.400
 most visited by families on weekends 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.380
 The Sunday morning closed the day. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 the decision was made after a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 three-year-old child was attacked by a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.840
 monkey nail on Saturday the animal that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 bit the boy's hand does not belong to the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.090
 zoo they live in natural habitat 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
 free in the municipal lake area 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.429
 there in their lake they give a lot of food 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 and banana is bread and these animals are 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 Wishing they are starting to arrive 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.149
 close to people 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 have been there for a long time and will cause 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 Problems problems will happen 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.170
 bites attacks and is going to be dangerous 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 the veterinarian believes that they are more 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.110
 twenty nails living freely 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.719
 in the region on Friday they 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.910
 facilitated the flight of four colleagues from the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 same species that live in captivity 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 they come to the zoo they're throwing 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.039
 the tiles they open to the screens 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 they help others because they 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.200
 also want to feed themselves is the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
 food of these monkeys so they 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 want to enter the premises to steal the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 food then we are suspicious 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 that these monkeys also helped 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.470
 escape from those here who are in here 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.720
 the zoo and plays artist and play longer 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 were recaptured on the morning of this 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.939
 Sunday there was only the guri who 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 insists on not going back into the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.240
 room, he paraded quietly in the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.570
 side of the trap set to capture 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 while we do the reporting the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 monkey attacked the boy appeared but 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.210
 direction does not know what to do to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.360
 to stop unwanted visits that are 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.780
 have become common and dangerous 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 for the time being the rattlesnake zoo 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.820
 will remain closed until a solution 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.920
 be found to ensure more 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.469
 security for visitors 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.350
 We have not yet had a year 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.560
 but we are already trying to streamline the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.770
 traps and we're going to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.180
 monkeys and let's ask the 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.329
 where we can 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.859
 In the future, the child became 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.680
 with a bruised hand 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.810
 were more than ten points the little boy was 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.549
 at santa catarina hospital and at 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.549
 Hi, I know.
