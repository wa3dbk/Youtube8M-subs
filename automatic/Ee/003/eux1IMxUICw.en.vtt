what<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.980> good<00:00:05.370> Jakob<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.299> today<00:00:06.540> it's

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
what is good Jakob here and today it's

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.450 
what is good Jakob here and today it's
all<00:00:06.960> about<00:00:07.020> speed<00:00:07.740> because<00:00:07.950> I'm<00:00:08.189> reviewing

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
all about speed because I'm reviewing

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.299 
all about speed because I'm reviewing
the<00:00:09.090> unroll<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.230> Lassiter<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.099> made

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the unroll the Lassiter which is made

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.310 
the unroll the Lassiter which is made
with<00:00:11.340> super<00:00:12.059> light<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.480> thin<00:00:12.660> materials<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
with super light and thin materials to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
with super light and thin materials to
get<00:00:13.440> unroll<00:00:13.860> right<00:00:14.460> back<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.690> speedgame

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
get unroll right back in the speedgame

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
get unroll right back in the speedgame
and<00:00:16.560> actually<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.250> reminds<00:00:17.550> me<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> bit<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and actually it reminds me a bit of the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.679 
and actually it reminds me a bit of the
og<00:00:19.020> adizero<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:20.039> 2010<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
og adizero from 2010 and if it's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
og adizero from 2010 and if it's
anything<00:00:22.080> close<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.920> good<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.550> feels<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
anything close to as good and feels the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.960 
anything close to as good and feels the
same<00:00:24.180> way<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.810> big<00:00:25.050> expectations<00:00:25.699> but<00:00:26.699> can

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
same way I have big expectations but can

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.419 
same way I have big expectations but can
unroll<00:00:27.359> compete<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> big<00:00:28.410> three<00:00:28.590> let's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
unroll compete with the big three let's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.120 
unroll compete with the big three let's
take<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.970> today<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.620> Opera<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
take a look today the Opera on the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.330 
take a look today the Opera on the
velociter<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> made<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.420> super<00:00:36.960> thin

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
velociter is made with this super thin

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
velociter is made with this super thin
one-piece<00:00:38.360> synthetic<00:00:39.360> upper<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.170> actually

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
one-piece synthetic upper that actually

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
one-piece synthetic upper that actually
is<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.980> thin<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.730> feels<00:00:42.059> thinner<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is so thin that it feels thinner and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
is so thin that it feels thinner and
softer<00:00:43.320> than<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> ones<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
softer than the ones we see on the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
softer than the ones we see on the
material<00:00:44.820> vapor<00:00:45.090> 10<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.020> current

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
material vapor 10 and the current

adizero

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
adizero

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.069 
adizero
and<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> feel<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> when<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and you feel that when you put the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.750 
and you feel that when you put the
velociter<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.219> gonna<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
velociter on because you're gonna get a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.540 
velociter on because you're gonna get a
really<00:00:51.300> close<00:00:51.690> second<00:00:52.320> skin<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.829> fit<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
really close second skin like fit that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
really close second skin like fit that
really<00:00:53.879> wraps<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.360> foot<00:00:54.390> without<00:00:54.809> being

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
really wraps your foot without being

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.590 
really wraps your foot without being
restrictive<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.550> simply<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
restrictive at all simply because we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.229 
restrictive at all simply because we
have<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.199> slightest<00:00:58.710> bit<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.070> stretch<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.789> the

have the slightest bit of stretch to the

have the slightest bit of stretch to the
upper<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.260> thin<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> close<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
upper it is so thin and close that you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.450 
upper it is so thin and close that you

can actually see the knuckles on your
toes

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.280 

also<00:01:17.970> Umbra<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.450> reworked<00:01:18.660> their<00:01:19.080> so-called

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
also Umbra have reworked their so-called

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
also Umbra have reworked their so-called
a<00:01:19.770> frame<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> supposed<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.480> keep<00:01:21.690> your

a frame which is supposed to keep your

a frame which is supposed to keep your
foot<00:01:22.050> on<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.440> plate<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> give<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> an

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
foot on the plate and give you an

foot on the plate and give you an
optimized<00:01:24.600> energy<00:01:25.230> output<00:01:25.620> for<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> more

optimized energy output for and more

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.060 
optimized energy output for and more
speed<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.420> while<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.350> necessarily<00:01:29.040> a

fly wire like super aggressive lockdown
it<00:01:31.620> does<00:01:31.800> this<00:01:31.920> job<00:01:32.160> because<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.580> food<00:01:32.850> moves

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it does this job because the food moves

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.540 
it does this job because the food moves
pretty<00:01:33.870> well<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.440> foot<00:01:34.680> without<00:01:35.220> giving

velocity might prove a bit of a

velocity might prove a bit of a

difficulty to squeeze into now size-wise

difficulty to squeeze into now size-wise
I'd<00:02:09.070> say<00:02:09.369> go<00:02:09.580> true<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.940> size<00:02:10.119> except<00:02:11.020> for<00:02:11.230> a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
usual size 40 is dead-on

of<00:02:17.820> course<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.120> minimal<00:02:19.630> design

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
of course this minimal design

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.530 
of course this minimal design
compromises<00:02:20.610> protection<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.790> little<00:02:22.390> bit

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
compromises protection a little bit

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.900 
compromises protection a little bit
actually<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.350> don't<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.739> much<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.459> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
actually you don't get much of it in the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.090 
actually you don't get much of it in the
velociter<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.989> be<00:02:26.140> honest<00:02:26.470> but<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.890> guess

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
velociter to be honest but I guess

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.460 
velociter to be honest but I guess
that's<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.850> deal<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.780> actually<00:02:29.110> while<00:02:29.290> it's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
that's the deal but actually while it's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.410 
that's the deal but actually while it's
not<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.650> comfortable<00:02:30.370> boot<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> classical

not a comfortable boot in the classical

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.330 
not a comfortable boot in the classical
sense<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.230> velocity<00:02:32.739> gives<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.100> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
sense the velocity gives you this

actually makes it a pretty nice move to

wear anyways and 165 gram means that you
get<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.470> mental<00:02:45.370> edge<00:02:45.580> because<00:02:46.090> they<00:02:46.269> are<00:02:46.480> so

no<00:02:50.410> boom<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> velociter<00:02:51.580> out<00:02:51.760> there

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
looking at the soleplate AMRO must have

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.590 
looking at the soleplate AMRO must have
taken<00:03:02.350> some<00:03:02.519> inspiration<00:03:03.519> from<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> previous

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
taken some inspiration from the previous

taken some inspiration from the previous
a<00:03:04.840> teasers<00:03:05.470> because<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.280> really<00:03:06.910> thin<00:03:07.180> but

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
a teasers because it is really thin but

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.289 
a teasers because it is really thin but
also<00:03:07.510> actually<00:03:07.840> relatively<00:03:08.769> stiff<00:03:09.070> and

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
also actually relatively stiff and

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.520 
also actually relatively stiff and
responsive<00:03:10.299> but<00:03:10.780> because<00:03:11.079> Umbro<00:03:11.380> have

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
responsive but because Umbro have

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.319 
responsive but because Umbro have

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
included these here flex screws you

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.880

actually<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:14.019> slight<00:03:14.500> amount<00:03:14.739> of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
actually get a slight amount of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.190 
actually get a slight amount of
flexibility<00:03:15.459> as<00:03:15.640> well<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.390> allow<00:03:16.780> your<00:03:16.959> foot

to move relatively freely and also for

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.259 
to move relatively freely and also for

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
kiss the sole is so thin you get really

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.210 
kiss the sole is so thin you get really
close<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.810> ground<00:03:23.019> but<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.680> also<00:03:23.860> means

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
close to the ground but it also means

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.009 
close to the ground but it also means
that<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.459> on<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.700> hand<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.540> feel<00:03:25.870> a

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
that the on the hand that you feel a

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.110 
that the on the hand that you feel a
little<00:03:26.320> bit<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.560> start<00:03:26.799> pressure<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.910> there

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
little bit of start pressure in there

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.210 
little bit of start pressure in there
looking<00:03:28.900> at<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.140> studs<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.590> get<00:03:29.769> these<00:03:29.920> three

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
looking at the studs you get these three

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.280 
looking at the studs you get these three
conical<00:03:30.850> studs<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.420> inside<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.079> plate

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
conical studs on the inside of the plate

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.640 
conical studs on the inside of the plate
to<00:03:32.320> give<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> pretty<00:03:33.070> good<00:03:33.510> rotational

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
to give you a pretty good rotational

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.650 
to give you a pretty good rotational
maneuverability<00:03:35.760> absolutely<00:03:36.760> no<00:03:36.970> complaints

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
maneuverability absolutely no complaints

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.340 
maneuverability absolutely no complaints
there<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:39.130> looking<00:03:39.880> at<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.420> diamond<00:03:41.049> shaped

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
there but looking at the diamond shaped

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.740 
there but looking at the diamond shaped
studs<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:42.220> me<00:03:42.430> they're<00:03:42.910> simply<00:03:43.299> not<00:03:43.329> big

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
studs to me they're simply not big

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.360 
studs to me they're simply not big
enough<00:03:43.780> because<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.440> surface<00:03:44.829> area<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.100> get

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
enough because the surface area you get

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.130 
enough because the surface area you get
when<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.700> push<00:03:45.970> off<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.510> not<00:03:46.690> big<00:03:46.870> enough<00:03:46.900> to

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
when you push off is not big enough to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.770 
when you push off is not big enough to
really<00:03:47.470> give<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:47.890> aggressive<00:03:48.790> traction

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
really give you that aggressive traction

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.840 
really give you that aggressive traction
and<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.109> me<00:03:50.230> that's<00:03:50.530> pretty<00:03:50.769> essential<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.489> a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
and to me that's pretty essential in a

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.460 
and to me that's pretty essential in a
speed<00:03:52.120> boot<00:03:52.359> now<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.930> not<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.200> end<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
speed boot now it's not the end of the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.170 
speed boot now it's not the end of the

world and they do their job for you all
but<00:03:55.630> it's<00:03:55.690> not<00:03:55.930> whether<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.350> la<00:03:56.500> città<00:03:56.880> excels

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
but it's not whether the la città excels

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.970 
but it's not whether the la città excels
when<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.569> comes<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.019> touch<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.470> velocity'
