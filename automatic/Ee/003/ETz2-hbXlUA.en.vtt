00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
because in cycling people see me for

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.610 
because in cycling people see me for
three<00:05:41.210> minutes<00:05:41.420> after<00:05:41.720> a<00:05:41.870> bike<00:05:42.110> race<00:05:42.350> you<00:05:42.560> know

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
three minutes after a bike race you know

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.130 
three minutes after a bike race you know
and<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:44.690> problem<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.200> that<00:05:46.840> there's<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.960> lot<00:05:48.110> of

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
and the problem is that there's a lot of

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.290 
and the problem is that there's a lot of
other<00:05:48.350> guys<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:48.860> like<00:05:49.070> me<00:05:49.250> but<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
other guys that I like me but the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.550 
other guys that I like me but the
cameras<00:05:50.690> don't<00:05:50.810> really<00:05:51.080> give<00:05:51.200> a<00:05:51.350> about

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
cameras don't really give a about

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.220 
cameras don't really give a about
them<00:05:51.980> you<00:05:52.160> know<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:52.550> they<00:05:52.760> don't<00:05:52.970> see<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.390> I'm

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
them you know so they don't see that I'm

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.990 
them you know so they don't see that I'm
the<00:05:54.470> same<00:05:54.710> as<00:05:54.740> most<00:05:55.010> other<00:05:55.250> people<00:05:55.670> after<00:05:55.970> a

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
the same as most other people after a

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.200 
the same as most other people after a
bike<00:05:56.210> race<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.630> know<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.960> think<00:05:57.800> it<00:05:58.790> takes<00:05:58.850> a

bike race you know I think it takes a

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.720 
bike race you know I think it takes a
narrow<00:05:59.450> mind<00:05:59.780> it<00:06:00.050> takes<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.500> closed<00:06:01.130> person<00:06:01.400> it

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730
