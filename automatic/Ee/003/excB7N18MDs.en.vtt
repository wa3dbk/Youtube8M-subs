the<00:00:25.109> router<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.320> blue

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the router you can see that blue

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.720 
the router you can see that blue
ethernet<00:00:29.099> right<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.849> goes<00:00:30.300> along<00:00:30.630> here

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
ethernet right there goes along here

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.819 
ethernet right there goes along here
over<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.030> power<00:00:33.360> line<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
over to this power line this is a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.020 
over to this power line this is a
netgear<00:00:35.399> powerline<00:00:35.610> AV<00:00:36.440> 500<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
netgear powerline AV 500 and this is a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.830 
netgear powerline AV 500 and this is a
really<00:00:39.480> cool<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:41.239> basically<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.540> brings

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
really cool thing it basically it brings

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.160 
really cool thing it basically it brings
Ethernet<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:44.700> lets<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.329> ethernet<00:00:45.809> over

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
Ethernet it lets you use ethernet over

Ethernet it lets you use ethernet over
the<00:00:46.950> electrical<00:00:47.670> wires<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.149> house<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
the electrical wires of the house it's a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
the electrical wires of the house it's a
really<00:00:50.520> confusing<00:00:50.820> concept<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:52.110> understand

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
really confusing concept to understand

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.450 
really confusing concept to understand
like<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> works<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.510> um

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460

Ethernet<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.390> usually

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
Ethernet the only thing we usually

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.420 
Ethernet the only thing we usually
really<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.590> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.640> house<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.240> on

our phones and laptops so there's no

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.420 
our phones and laptops so there's no
more<00:01:53.009> desktops<00:01:53.520> using<00:01:54.149> Wi-Fi<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.979> used<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
more desktops using Wi-Fi and I used to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.760 
more desktops using Wi-Fi and I used to
have<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> server<00:01:56.880> computer<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> closet<00:01:58.140> but

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
have a server computer in the closet but

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
have a server computer in the closet but
um<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.490> don't<00:02:00.240> anymore<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
um I don't anymore because it's the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520 
um I don't anymore because it's the
summer<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:03.090> computer<00:02:03.570> generates<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> ton

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
summer and that computer generates a ton

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069 
summer and that computer generates a ton
of<00:02:04.560> heat<00:02:05.450> probably<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> bring<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> back

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
of heat probably going to bring it back

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.669 
of heat probably going to bring it back
in<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> winter<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:09.599> central<00:02:10.410> air<00:02:10.560> in

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
in the winter but the central air in

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
in the winter but the central air in
this<00:02:10.770> house<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.280> pretty<00:02:11.520> bad<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
this house is pretty bad it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.290 
this house is pretty bad it's
it's<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.409> old<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.890> airs<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.909> cold<00:02:15.120> as

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
it's really old and airs not as cold as

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
it's really old and airs not as cold as
it<00:02:15.330> used<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.659> be<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:18.349> pretty<00:02:19.349> much<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:20.280> its

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
it used to be so it's pretty much on its

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.259 
it used to be so it's pretty much on its
way<00:02:20.760> out<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.470> yeah<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.580> network<00:02:24.030> setup

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
way out so yeah that's the network setup

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.759 
way out so yeah that's the network setup
I'm<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> finish<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.140> off<00:02:25.290> by<00:02:25.319> doing<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
I'm going to finish it off by doing a

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.020 
I'm going to finish it off by doing a
speed<00:02:26.069> test<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.769> extremely<00:02:29.400> fast
