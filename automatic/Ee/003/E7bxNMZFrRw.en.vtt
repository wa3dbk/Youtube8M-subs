00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
speed picking pentatonic pattern but

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
speed picking pentatonic pattern but
what<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> let's<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.720> shall<00:01:09.750> we

what of it let's get on with it shall we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.120 
what of it let's get on with it shall we
it's<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:11.160> hard<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:13.010> harder<00:01:14.010> than

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it's pretty hard this one harder than

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's pretty hard this one harder than
Ron<00:01:14.340> Jeremy<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.060> film<00:01:15.420> set<00:01:16.880> okay<00:01:17.880> let<00:01:18.119> me

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
Ron Jeremy on a film set okay let me

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
Ron Jeremy on a film set okay let me
explain<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.680> E<00:01:19.890> minor<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
explain it to you it is in E minor and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
explain it to you it is in E minor and
there's<00:01:21.240> lots<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> pentatonic<00:01:22.140> stuff<00:01:22.380> going

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there's lots of pentatonic stuff going

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's lots of pentatonic stuff going
on<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.160> lots<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> economy<00:01:23.880> picking<00:01:24.060> well

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
on there's lots of economy picking well

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.980 
on there's lots of economy picking well
speed<00:01:24.810> picking<00:01:25.910> picking<00:01:26.910> at<00:01:27.090> speed<00:01:27.840> basically

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
speed picking picking at speed basically

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.859 
speed picking picking at speed basically
so<00:01:30.990> let's<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> look<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> shall<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so let's take a look at it shall we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
so let's take a look at it shall we
first<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.470> first<00:01:34.530> though<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.250> important

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
first things first though it's important

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
first things first though it's important
to<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.060> timing<00:01:36.330> right<00:01:36.660> with<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.960> you've

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
to get the timing right with this you've

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
to get the timing right with this you've
got<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.410> be<00:01:37.500> spanked<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.910> timing

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
got to be spanked on with the timing

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 
got to be spanked on with the timing
otherwise<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.649> ain't<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> work

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
otherwise it ain't going to work

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.260 
otherwise it ain't going to work
so<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.430> we're<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.910> start

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so what do we have we're going to start

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450 
so what do we have we're going to start
here<00:01:45.720> fret<00:01:46.110> seven<00:01:46.410> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> string<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.160> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
here fret seven of the a string and we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.990 
here fret seven of the a string and we
have<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.880> pan

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.750 

so<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.690> all<00:01:51.810> might<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.440> might<00:01:52.890> vape<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
so it's all might be a might vape on a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.800 
so it's all might be a might vape on a
minor<00:01:54.120> pentatonic

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.100 

I'm<00:01:58.810> going<00:01:59.140> down

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'm going down

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
I'm going down
but<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.190> can<00:02:02.340> pick<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.670> whichever<00:02:02.970> way<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
but you can pick it whichever way you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.210 
but you can pick it whichever way you
like<00:02:03.570> whichever<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.140> comfortable<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.140 

okay<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.460> we're<00:02:08.580> gonna<00:02:08.700> go

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.540 

that's<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.240> first<00:02:12.450> party

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that's the first party

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.580 
that's the first party
so<00:02:15.630> I'll<00:02:16.630> do<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.780> slowly<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.410> see

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
so I'll do it slowly so you can see

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
so I'll do it slowly so you can see
what's<00:02:17.740> going<00:02:18.190> on

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
what's going on

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.050 
what's going on
No

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.760 

okay<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:26.959> we're<00:02:27.050> going<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.230> shift<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
okay then we're going to shift into this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.699 
okay then we're going to shift into this
position<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.220> descend

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.340 

okay

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
okay

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.250 
okay
Oh

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.270 

something<00:02:41.260> lives<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.620> along<00:02:42.040> those<00:02:42.310> lines

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
something lives on along those lines

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.350 
something lives on along those lines
make<00:02:45.280> sure<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.519> don't<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.819> what<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> just<00:02:46.209> did

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
make sure you don't be what I just did

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.830 
make sure you don't be what I just did
there<00:02:50.310> has<00:02:51.310> something<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.939> then<00:02:52.599> we're

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
there has something like that then we're

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.630 
there has something like that then we're
going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> go<00:02:53.260> off<00:02:53.769> until<00:02:54.159> next<00:02:54.310> we're<00:02:54.549> going

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
going to go off until next we're going

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.960 
going to go off until next we're going
to<00:02:54.700> go<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:57.040> 14<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.790> 12<00:02:58.090> 14<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.840> 16<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:03:00.790> going

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
to go here 14 to 12 14 and 16 I'm going

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.369 
to go here 14 to 12 14 and 16 I'm going
to<00:03:01.030> ascend<00:03:02.609> like<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:04.140> pretty<00:03:05.140> challenging

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
to ascend like that pretty challenging

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.589 
to ascend like that pretty challenging
this<00:03:05.769> part<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.000> because<00:03:07.359> it's<00:03:07.510> on

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
this part and with this because it's on

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.240 
this part and with this because it's on
an<00:03:07.720> offbeat<00:03:07.870> you've<00:03:08.590> got<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.859> make<00:03:09.010> sure<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
an offbeat you've got to make sure the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.770 
an offbeat you've got to make sure the
timings<00:03:09.640> bang<00:03:09.879> on<00:03:10.060> here<00:03:10.239> cuz<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.599> really

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
timings bang on here cuz it can really

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.110 
timings bang on here cuz it can really
throw<00:03:10.900> you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.980 

okay<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.470> we've<00:03:18.680> done<00:03:19.330> then<00:03:20.330> we<00:03:20.420> get

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.330 

okay<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:24.070> get<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.430> picture

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.800 

now<00:03:28.910> when<00:03:29.180> we're<00:03:29.330> here<00:03:29.510> we're<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
now when we're here we're going to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.970 
now when we're here we're going to
ascend<00:03:30.200> through<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.830> shape<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.500> still<00:03:33.800> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
ascend through the shape so still a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.710 
ascend through the shape so still a
minor<00:03:34.310> pentatonic

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.890 

so<00:03:39.720> slowly<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.350> is

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.259 

I'm<00:03:46.379> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> shift<00:03:46.739> up<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.099> fret<00:03:47.310> 24<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.060> what

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
I'm going to shift up to fret 24 so what

00:03:48.269 --> 00:04:00.570 
I'm going to shift up to fret 24 so what
we<00:03:48.360> got<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.690> far<00:03:48.720> is

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.260 

okay<00:04:01.300> then<00:04:01.510> we're<00:04:01.630> going<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.810> simply<00:04:03.270> just

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
okay then we're going to simply just

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.690 
okay then we're going to simply just
descend<00:04:04.690> through<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.080> shape<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:09.220> really

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
descend through that shape it really

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.810 
descend through that shape it really
works<00:04:09.910> well<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:12.190> picking<00:04:12.460> pattern<00:04:12.550> that<00:04:12.730> I'm

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
works well the picking pattern that I'm

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.250 
works well the picking pattern that I'm
using<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.240> really<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.660> blast<00:04:13.900> through<00:04:14.020> that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
using to really just blast through that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.250 
using to really just blast through that
scale<00:04:14.820> relatively<00:04:15.820> comfortably<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:16.959> once<00:04:17.200> we

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
scale relatively comfortably so once we

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.890 
scale relatively comfortably so once we
come<00:04:17.440> out<00:04:18.269> we're<00:04:19.269> going<00:04:19.360> to<00:04:19.420> ascend<00:04:19.750> through

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
come out we're going to ascend through

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.310 
come out we're going to ascend through
it<00:04:20.290> I<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.950> what<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.100> do<00:04:21.190> here<00:04:21.640> is<00:04:22.570> hammer<00:04:22.930> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
it I think what I do here is hammer and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.990 
it I think what I do here is hammer and
then<00:04:24.130> what<00:04:24.280> we're<00:04:24.400> going<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.550> do<00:04:24.730> is<00:04:24.850> we're

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
then what we're going to do is we're

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.110 
then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.180> get<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:26.100> tap<00:04:27.100> here<00:04:27.130> there's<00:04:27.670> no<00:04:27.790> fret

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
going to get a tap here there's no fret

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.580 
going to get a tap here there's no fret
there<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:28.540> just<00:04:28.720> where<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.020> fret<00:04:29.260> would<00:04:29.410> be

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
there but just where the fret would be

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.000 
there but just where the fret would be
just<00:04:30.010> tap<00:04:30.280> above<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.700> pickup<00:04:32.370> oops<00:04:34.890> what<00:04:35.890> was

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
just tap above the pickup oops what was

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.730 
just tap above the pickup oops what was
it<00:04:36.160> again

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
it again

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.630 
it again
that<00:04:38.740> was<00:04:38.890> it<00:04:40.770> don't<00:04:41.770> do<00:04:41.950> what<00:04:42.100> I'm<00:04:42.220> doing<00:04:42.250> that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
that was it don't do what I'm doing that

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.700 
that was it don't do what I'm doing that
sounds<00:04:42.880> bloody<00:04:43.090> awful<00:04:46.290> make<00:04:47.290> sure<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.590> get

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
sounds bloody awful make sure you get

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:58.290 
sounds bloody awful make sure you get
the<00:04:47.830> pitch<00:04:48.010> right<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:48.960> there<00:04:49.960> we<00:04:50.050> go<00:04:57.060> here<00:04:58.060> at

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
the pitch right here there we go here at

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.330 
the pitch right here there we go here at
the<00:04:58.390> top<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:58.990> we<00:04:59.110> have<00:05:03.810> once<00:05:04.810> we've<00:05:04.960> done<00:05:05.110> that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the top so we have once we've done that

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.590 
the top so we have once we've done that
this<00:05:06.340> is<00:05:06.460> slightly<00:05:06.610> different<00:05:07.150> position<00:05:07.240> to

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
this is slightly different position to

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.950 
this is slightly different position to
this<00:05:07.690> one<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.020> is<00:05:08.910> just<00:05:09.910> behind<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.330> pole<00:05:10.510> PC

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
this one this is just behind the pole PC

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.170 
this one this is just behind the pole PC
and<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.200> is<00:05:11.350> just<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:12.250> front<00:05:12.610> of<00:05:12.820> it<00:05:12.910> on<00:05:13.060> the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
and this is just in front of it on the

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.950 
and this is just in front of it on the
top<00:05:13.360> E<00:05:13.510> string<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:15.570> then<00:05:16.570> we're<00:05:16.780> going<00:05:16.900> to

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
top E string and then we're going to

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.020 
top E string and then we're going to
move<00:05:17.080> down<00:05:17.110> to<00:05:17.440> this<00:05:17.530> E<00:05:17.680> minor<00:05:17.890> shape<00:05:18.160> tap

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
move down to this E minor shape tap

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.390 
move down to this E minor shape tap
again

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:32.159 

you

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.379 

that's<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.500> think<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:34.790> let<00:05:34.940> me<00:05:35.030> do<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.180> really

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
that's it I think so let me do it really

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:53.520 
that's it I think so let me do it really
slowly

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:02.410 

here<00:05:54.530> we<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:59.410> makes
