00:00:00.889 --> 00:00:07.350
 good to everyone I'm respected I'm here 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.389
 with people to introduce you whitman and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 that having risen the blackmail then 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.589
 we hope there's a lot more to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.990
 activity that we have done and 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.060
 Well, you're just going to recruit 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.449
 players and editors since fx we are 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.089
 quite followed and so clear and that has 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.470
 given my partner to happen to have shots 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.480
 what will have to do the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.900
 players 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.290
 because nothing for the players should 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 wear badge 3 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.040

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 a lot of time 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 the capturer is almost essential 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.670
 you avoid warfare 3 and repress them 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.780
 arrive multi cause they will be more 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 valued that yes do not send me to seclude me 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 in that it does not have any clip because we 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.600
 we are going to take and nothing I hope you have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
 time and it's power and played back left 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.400
 to comply with what the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.760
 editors 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.250
 in the issue of editing we will not touch 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 how many clicks on the description of 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.390
 same so long 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 we were quick to take it easy because 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.520
 they're distant we're not going to catch it like that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.320
 have to take it easy do it well and if 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.450
