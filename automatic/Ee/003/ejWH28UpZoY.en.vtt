00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.310
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.020
 today to finally talk to you about 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.370
 mineral varnish fusion so you in 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.919
 talk I told myself it's when 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.799
 same time to a small street on these 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.719
 varnish that I discover now there is 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.889
 almost a year you are not a year 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.879
 because I think it was 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.490
 at the time of the return that I am in 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.840
 spoke then look for polishes in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.090
 felt on grass at the time 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.859
 hypo toxic and then I came across 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.179
 these famous varnish scared this name had 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.679
 spoke I found it a little bit our 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.390
 charges him thierry look nice to me 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.050
 strangely we do not talk about it 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.119
 still weird 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.439
 and so here is jallet tent is imminent 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.910
 have ordered an exchange had 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.260
 besides spoken directly in the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.160
 stride because since I'm 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.270
 completely fan 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.579
 so as I told you I 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.350
 looking for hypo toxic varnishes so 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.120
 empty stage that is to say devoid of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.910
 some certain matters really 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.980
 heavy and toxic like toluene and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.640
 it was to us that I fell on it and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.469
 here it is a 4 free since they do not 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.800
 do not contain toluene formaldehyde 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.629
 of dbt phthalate and camphor so 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.579
 here I was oriented to that as 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.890
 under an opinion I had already spoken about it in 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.479
 the review of varnish april etc 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 I told you that I was interested 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.630
 a lot so good by cons 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.720
 indeed it had stopped me 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.460
 because the formula has been lightened 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.900
 since we have more these heavy materials 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.759
 on the other hand, it does not mean 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.020
 that these are so-called natural wines not 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.369
 at any rate, we can see the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.689
 composition on grass 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 when we realize it's not 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.770
 Too much natural, however, we have these 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.939
 heavy materials that have been subtracted 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.530
 to the formula it's true that for example 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.030
 toluene we talked a lot about 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.229
 because apparently it would really be 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.299
 very irritating to the skin 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.860
 not to mention that we breathe a lot 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.509
 from these materials to the application 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 hence the interest of always after 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.710
 outside or open the window 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.450
 so now we know today that he 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.430
 it is better to avoid these materials even if 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.590
 we are always on a compound when 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.909
 even completely synthetic one of 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.399
 memories I had seen the composition 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.049
 maguÃ¨ye completely synthetic one is 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.829
 anyway on something good 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.880
 less toxic 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.049
 after that there is still varnish one 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.890
 little bit more soft with 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.750
 compositions 80 90% natural today 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 we have good results are more expensive 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.439
 1 we do not feel better going anyway 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.820
 but before their date good results and 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.410
 then after there are varnishes with water but 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 I think it's a little bit more 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.390
 always mixed is it me that blow 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.819
 they got me 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.520
 interested is all see the composition 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.440
 and belongs to everyone to see if that 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.780
 you satisfied or not me that's me 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.209
 satisfied so I wanted to try 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.000
 especially since a format of 10 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 milliliters is sold around 5 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.610
 hours or 15 on the site 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.100
 I think it's still a very 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.930
 very good value for intel 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.209
 conditioning so I find that when 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 even pretty interesting is that it's 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.580
 a big conditionings and more so 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.870
 I was going to be able to use it very 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.000
 long time if you want to keep in 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.470
 optimal conditions so what 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.570
 I like in these varnishes that's all 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 simply their pigmentation their 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.010
 opacity and their outfits that are 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.900
 really amazing in one layer we have 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 a flawless result completely 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.610
 opaque we have no transparency we did not 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.920
 no streaks we do not see any shots of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.709
 brush the result is perfectly 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.120
 smooth I'm really a fan of all 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.620
 varnish you can in my long 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.200
 young woman life 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.180
 it's the best is really too many 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 confused including varnishes 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.269
 conventional and luxury polishes end 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.730
 luxury brands 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.500
 honestly it's the best so I 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.239
 think it's because the texture and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 species so suddenly it comes well 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.709
 to be deposited and wrapped long 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.120
 really we do not see anything anymore and at 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.250
 level of the outfit is enough 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
 incredible too since me varnish 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.730
 I'm not doing very well at home 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.650
 too many things in a day I do 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.090
 from the household or with my son I life 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.950
 you know the small pressures etc 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.959
 I quickly make a burst is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.670
 true it's going fast and with this one 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.320
 honestly my nail polish holds a lot 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.870
 a lot much longer 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.510
 pretty amazing has a lot a lot 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 no longer we will say that 48 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.590
 hours I keep it what and I admit that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.000
 it seduces me enormously all the more 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.320
 it dries quickly and that's 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.060
 really comfortable because less 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.170
 wait an hour as my vernissage 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.579
 it's just not possible 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.230
 So I appreciated its true value 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.610
 that it dries very very fast and really 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.110
 it is impeccable no longer has this effect 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.549
 flowing suddenly you do not go to see 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.010
 all these little tricou passion all 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.110
 his hair or we have a little shock he 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.410
 dries very quickly and even without a toque 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.750
 top 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.269
 in addition to that it offers a very very 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.769
 good brush the brush actually is wide 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.600
 so I really like what I 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.669
 hate brushes too too hungry here 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.470
 it allows a precise net application 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.030
 but especially fast it's true that in 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.370
 some brushstrokes on 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.330
 his manicure is going extremely fast and 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.250
 it's truly pleasent 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.360
 so I had some concerns that the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.220
 first two because they were bad 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.620
 implanted compared to the caps but 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.910
 on the other I have no worries that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.610
 are very very good polish 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.990
 so I tried four colors so 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.790
 the first puts an end and I do not 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.250
 had spoken immediately it's about 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.050
 moka stone which is a novel color 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330
 beautiful of all the colors that I 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.919
 presentais are devoid of glitter 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.810
 mother-of-pearl or whatever it is these are 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.600
 matte colors so in the color 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.490
 confined and here it was a move 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.530
 marked out which is really very very beautiful 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.060
 and classes he is elegant but he 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.560
 is also discreet and very easy to 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.810
 to wear is for me besides a 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.370
 essential 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.660
 and then afterwards I could try the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.520
 rose quartz which is an old rose franc 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.020
 dark who is really very pretty with 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.980
 a little vintage side that I like 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.110
 very much 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.820
 in addition to that as he is at a 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.990
 really accurate application with a 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.669
 very good opacity 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.410
 we see it right away it turns out 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.389
 very very well on the nails and this 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.120
 little quirky side I like a lot I 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.900
 finds in more very classy and then one 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.250
 my favorites 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.169
 however even my darling 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.910
 I had already told you about it 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.950
 red clay that is a real haven is 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.630
 real beautiful red but really beautiful 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.460
 and very supported and really very 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.100
 brilliant I find it really very 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.479
 pretty in addition to that on these polishes we 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.890
 Hall notes that attracts a neck 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.600
 little bit stays on my nails this is 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.700
 good to have a really perfect finish and 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.620
 well there that is elected in this case it 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.180
 give it to me it is really superb 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.820
 it is true that it is a real beautiful red 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.169
 very very feminine which in addition applies 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.450
 very well so it's really 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.890
 nice on it's sure it's one always 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.840
 a little bit afraid to miss you must not 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.979
 hide it is true that I overflow 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.660
 never there suddenly it's really 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.720
 flawless the application is very easy 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.950
 and this one plays and to finish it's 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.440
 the one I like the least 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.870
 these are coral reefs which is 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.520
 so a slightly neon coral that my 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.930
 faith and still perfect for the summer 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 I think he was really trendy 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.020
 for the summer he was really really 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.610
 perfect by cons he has a little 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.080
 too neon for me is what I 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.550
 look on this one is that I am 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.600
 obliged to put two layers because 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.280
 we tend to see the shots 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.900
 brush on this one maybe because 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.990
 that he was born in and suddenly broke me 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.850
 are not the same 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.440
 or texture I do not know too much good 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.970
 it's still a very good mayor nor I 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.350
 I'm a fan but this one 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.690
 it's the one I like the least I have 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.070
 also tested the base and the top coat 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.870
 inevitably I was so it's him 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.430
 that I ended up opting for that 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.350
 thus ending the previous 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.080
 so it's always the same thing a 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.460
 they are 4 free also yes so we have 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.830
 always this same piece because 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.990
 as much as I like a quick application on 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.340
 the werning as much on the basis it's 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.110
 even worse must I go even more 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.820
 quickly so it's true that I appreciate everything 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.470
 as much to have a wide brush 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.670
 so that's the base the mass is 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.360
 really very very well she does well 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.890
 his job 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.810
 it protects well there moment I think 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.240
 same as it improves the holding of 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.580
 varnish but especially they dry quickly 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.780
 which allows me to ask in stride 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.760
 its varnish what I find rather 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.600
 nice of the blow she does exactly this 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.220
 I was waiting and I really like 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.260
 when everything is a product 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.140
 also that I like a lot but a 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.910
 little less because in fact it puts more 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.690
 time to dry more time than all 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.340
 the others so it's true that I 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.080
 tendency to put the varnish out at 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.490
 collage part like that seen who holds well 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.110
 I do not take my head too much I won 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.930
 a little bit of time be I when 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.100
 even to do it to you but here's this one 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.110
 it takes a little while to dry 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.000
 that said I like it a lot because 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.430
 does it will offer a glossy finish and 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.200
 lakes is really beautiful which in addition 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.760
 do not go spinning what I find 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.840
 rather nice it's true that it is 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.280
 with the top coat then just 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.930
 we manipulate a few things 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.620
 and directly it starts to skate 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.450
 to disappear 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.010
 there the brilliant finish but really very 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.510
 brilliant is very long time shot 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.660
 is just as nice as all 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.310
 other products that's it's over for 

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.810
 this review is true it's a 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.880
 great discovery this year I think 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.000
 not that they are part of my favorites 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.430
 2014 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.660
 if you tried colors do not hesitate 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.770
 no I'm maybe there are others 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.150
 die that you like well do not hesitate 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.290
 not to me also talk is 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.490
 always with pleasure that I read you 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.790
 you know well and I tell you to very 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.690
 soon 

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.970
 well I will manage a little bit I was 

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.720
 present in one of my favorites and I 

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.720
 no longer have to beat
