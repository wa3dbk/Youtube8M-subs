off eBay was a special deal I got it for
around<00:00:16.920> $30<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:18.000> 33<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:19.199> shipping<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
around $30 I think 33 with shipping and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.130 
around $30 I think 33 with shipping and
all<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.789> good<00:00:21.029> stuff<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.960> already

all of that good stuff and I've already

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
all of that good stuff and I've already
unboxed<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.820> so

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
unboxed it as you can see so

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.589 
unboxed it as you can see so
unfortunately<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.410> an<00:00:25.890> official

unfortunately this is not an official

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.910 
unfortunately this is not an official
unboxing<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> everything<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
unboxing but here is everything that I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.479 
unboxing but here is everything that I
got<00:00:29.210> there<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> scanner<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.920> dock

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
got there was the scanner and the dock

got there was the scanner and the dock
the<00:00:32.850> scanner<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> inside<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> dock<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.980> power

two double-a batteries which came with
it<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:43.260> Duracell<00:00:43.739> batteries<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.430> you

it two Duracell batteries actually you
thought<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.180> thought<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.570> pretty<00:00:45.750> good

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
connect the scanner to the computer so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.789 
connect the scanner to the computer so
overall<00:01:07.619> I'm<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.299> really<00:01:09.299> pleased<00:01:09.810> with

overall I'm really really pleased with
this<00:01:11.100> device<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> show<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.900> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this device and I want to show it to you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
this device and I want to show it to you
let<00:01:13.170> me<00:01:13.290> scoot<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.130> other<00:01:14.610> stuff<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
let me scoot this other stuff out of the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.399 
let me scoot this other stuff out of the
way<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.920> scanner<00:01:17.280> itself<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.330> pop<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
way so the scanner itself can pop out of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.300 
way so the scanner itself can pop out of
the<00:01:19.530> dock<00:01:20.780> that's<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.020> actual<00:01:22.350> scanner<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the dock that's the actual scanner and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.899 
the dock that's the actual scanner and
if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
if you want to you can just use it that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.510 
if you want to you can just use it that
way<00:01:26.939> I've<00:01:27.500> done<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
way I've done a little bit with it that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
way I've done a little bit with it that
way<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.799> it's<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.280> me<00:01:35.659> even<00:01:36.659> though<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
way and it's to me even though this is

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.380 
way and it's to me even though this is
how<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> advertised<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> handheld

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
how it's advertised as a handheld

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.899 
how it's advertised as a handheld
scanner<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> little

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
scanner to me it's it's a little

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.090 
scanner to me it's it's a little
difficult<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.740> difficult<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.860> get<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
difficult but difficult to get it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
difficult but difficult to get it
perfectly<00:01:44.490> straight<00:01:44.610> anyway<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> push

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
perfectly straight anyway but you push

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:57.010 
perfectly straight anyway but you push
the<00:01:45.990> button<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.110> give<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> scan

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.740 

push<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.500> button<00:01:57.740> again<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.570> see<00:01:59.719> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
push the button again and you can see a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.630 
push the button again and you can see a
preview<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.320> what<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.890> scanned<00:02:01.159> right<00:02:01.429> there

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
preview of what you scanned right there

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.679 
preview of what you scanned right there
and<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.820> little<00:02:01.969> window<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.359> preview

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
and that little window the preview

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.469 
and that little window the preview
disappears<00:02:03.429> real<00:02:04.429> quick<00:02:04.789> but<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.060> do<00:02:05.179> get<00:02:05.329> it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
disappears real quick but you do get it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.810 
disappears real quick but you do get it
preview<00:02:05.899> so<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.350> does<00:02:06.590> work<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.159> way<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.640> it

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
preview so it does work that way and it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.630 
preview so it does work that way and it
works<00:02:08.030> quite<00:02:08.360> well<00:02:08.479> but<00:02:09.050> you're<00:02:09.649> you're<00:02:10.039> often

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
works quite well but you're you're often

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.960 
works quite well but you're you're often
going<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.150> get<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.540> picture<00:02:12.440> that's<00:02:12.910> slanted<00:02:13.910> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
going to get a picture that's slanted a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.600 
going to get a picture that's slanted a
little<00:02:14.150> bit<00:02:14.269> or<00:02:14.390> skewed<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.049> that<00:02:15.260> really

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
little bit or skewed and that really

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.300 
little bit or skewed and that really
bothers<00:02:16.610> me<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:17.239> lot<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.830> can't<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.190> it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
bothers me a lot but you can't do it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.280 
bothers me a lot but you can't do it

about you know it being perfectly at
right-angles<00:02:25.910> then<00:02:26.420> maybe<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.930> won't

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
right-angles then maybe that won't

you how the dock works the dock can be a

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.180 
you how the dock works the dock can be a
little<00:03:46.010> tricky<00:03:47.380> sometimes<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.889> doesn't

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
little tricky sometimes it doesn't

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.990 
little tricky sometimes it doesn't
always<00:03:49.310> want<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.639> take<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.030> paper<00:03:51.849> now<00:03:52.849> on

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
always want to take the paper now on

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.800 
always want to take the paper now on
this<00:03:53.120> occasion<00:03:53.180> did<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.079> there<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.319> go

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.570 

and<00:03:57.810> there's<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.620> Crete<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.340> was<00:03:59.520> a

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
and there's the Crete you so that was a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.150 
and there's the Crete you so that was a
pretty<00:03:59.970> good<00:04:00.090> scan<00:04:00.390> I've<00:04:01.350> learned<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.890> do<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.100> a

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
pretty good scan I've learned to do it a

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.590 
pretty good scan I've learned to do it a
little<00:04:02.340> better<00:04:02.520> when<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.790> first<00:04:03.180> started<00:04:03.480> it

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
little better when I first started it

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.070 
little better when I first started it
was<00:04:03.660> jamming<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.380> lot<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.600> I'd<00:04:06.600> have<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.900> pull

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
was jamming a lot and I'd have to pull

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.330 
was jamming a lot and I'd have to pull
the<00:04:07.170> paper<00:04:07.350> out<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.740> doesn't<00:04:07.980> really<00:04:08.069> hurt

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
the paper out now it doesn't really hurt

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.420 
the paper out now it doesn't really hurt
it<00:04:08.490> when<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.760> jams<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:10.050> get<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.980> bad

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
it when it jams you just get a bad

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.160 
it when it jams you just get a bad
picture<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:12.300> really<00:04:12.510> no<00:04:12.780> big<00:04:12.990> deal

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
picture and that's really no big deal

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.440 
picture and that's really no big deal
because<00:04:13.380> when<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.950> put<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:14.700> SD<00:04:14.880> card<00:04:15.090> into

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
because when you put the SD card into

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.970 
because when you put the SD card into
your<00:04:15.630> computer<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.049> just<00:04:16.230> delete<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.590> one

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
your computer you just delete that one

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.970 
your computer you just delete that one
and<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:18.109> rescanned<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.260> again<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.650> go<00:04:19.799> on

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
and if you rescanned it again you go on

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.220 
and if you rescanned it again you go on
with<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.280> next<00:04:20.519> one<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.760> good<00:04:20.910> one<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.660> it's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
with the next one the good one so it's

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.950 
with the next one the good one so it's
not<00:04:22.410> perfect<00:04:23.040> perhaps<00:04:23.790> but<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.660> picture

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
not perfect perhaps but the picture

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.720 
not perfect perhaps but the picture
quality<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.740> pretty<00:04:26.190> good<00:04:26.340> good<00:04:26.580> enough

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
quality is is pretty good good enough
