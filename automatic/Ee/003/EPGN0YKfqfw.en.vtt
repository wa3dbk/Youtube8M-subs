00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.850
 from my brief life experience i have 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.799
 learned that knowing how to draw depends 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.420
 roughly by two factors the hand and the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.070
 brain have a good hand means 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 know how to modulate the line well 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.309
 pressure and make the pencil 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.410
 travels exactly set path 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 having the brain in the design means 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.199
 recognize the proportions to do 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150
 a good summary of the forms and gods 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 colors and know how to establish well 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.359
 the path that the pencil must make there 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 they are very many people with a good one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.660
 hand than those with a brain 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.920
 trained because to train the hand 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.840
 just draw in any way 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.040
 anything in order to train at 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.750
 be more precise to modulate the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.280
 pressure is very common especially 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 in children draw in a manner 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 stereotyped if a child's insignia 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 that the flower becomes so he will assign 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 this symbol to the meaning of the flower 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 and whenever you need to mark one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.629
 it will be applied as a model in practice 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.280
 by drawing in this way we create gods 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.110
 models in our head that are not 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.370
 necessarily faithful to the real world or 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 what we actually want 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.579
 represent the most direct way to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.469
 moving away from this type of design is 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.210
 learn to draw from life by drawing 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.920
 from life always to represent what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.480
 is seen respecting the proportions ai 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.800
 colors and the more you train the more we learn 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.090
 to distinguish the various forms for 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.010
 get off the objects they represent 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.450
 to mark from the photos and less useful 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 because the proportions are much more 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.930
 easy to take from a model that already 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 in two dimensions and then make volumes 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 will be more difficult from the photos it acts 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 like a photocopier if you draw from 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 much more information is processed 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.930
 as you know during the making of 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 a drawing there is a preparation phase 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530
 and a finishing stage 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 Preparation is the one where the brain and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 main role for you to decide 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 proportions the colors the lights and the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 perspective of a guide that will be used for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 the actual realization that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.479
 will mainly engage a hand because 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.740
 the drawing has actually already been done e 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.329
 we just have to finish it with one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 certain technique that can be 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.329
 clear dark in pencil and color with i 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 oil paints the curello crayons 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.970
 tempera and everything else 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.409
 so if I do a good hand but still 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 I have not learned to do the proportions is 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.619
 very likely that once finished the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 drawing this appears technically well 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 done but with obvious problems 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 structural in the opposite case much less 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.490
 frequently we will have a drawing 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.439
 proportionate but not finished second 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.939
 me anyone who has available 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.170
 hands with a good dose of method and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.880
 commitment can become a good one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 designer the natural predisposition 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.450
 it's just an initial advantage that often 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 works as a push to commit to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.549
 do more 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.409
 so sometimes those who are prepared then 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.330
 commitment really becomes very good 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.009
 it is essential to design with 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.360
 constancy trying to correct one's own 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.110
 errors but the method is even more 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.569
 important 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
 I can also draw 24 hours a day, but 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.420
 if I do nothing but copy 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.340
 dragon ball designs I will never become 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 really good in practice to score 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 so it becomes useless if we come 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 just the hand many guys that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 they want to learn how to make comics yes 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.019
 they concentrate too much on scoring 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.709
 only comics copying theirs 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.629
 favorite 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.310
 the thing is not wrong but not enough for 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.690
 learning the comic book well is nothing more than 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.010
 a synthesis of reality therefore for 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.780
 needing to be good anyway 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.519
 a good deal of life drawing 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 in practice drawing only character 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.090
 of dragon ball I scollinando only the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.709
 hand I do not learn anything except to do alone 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150
 those characters do just that is not 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.220
 wrong but certainly not enough 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 have a good brain trained in the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.459
 drawing is not necessary just for 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.959
 become a cartoonist and illustrator 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.700
 fundamental for all the mysteries in 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.870
 futurama visual artistic field 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.430
 from the interior of architecture design 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.349
 animation stylism in animation 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.880
 also very important to be fast on 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.620
 life drawing is very useful for the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.940
 speed then from my experience I have 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.769
 learned that anyone can become 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.120
 good at drawing training those who 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.739
 I call the fact the factor remains 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.269
 brain to train the hand is enough 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.980
 draw so much like this there 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.600
 we will get used to modulating the trait and being 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
 be precise to do so 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.569
 that the pencil is worth exactly where 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.280
 we want to train the brain more 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.720
 difficult but fundamental to learn to 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.489
 represent what you want without 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.049
 based on our mental models in 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.790
 a technique you use to get started is 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.230
 try to copy a printed vote 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
 turning the photo by drawing to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.440
 otherwise we will try to 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.819
 realize the single lines because there 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.260
 it will be more difficult to enclose it in a 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.120
 model the fastest method to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.889
 train the brain and score from 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.780
 true learning to draw what is 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.370
 therefore it is essential to practice 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.989
 and do not neglect the hand factor in the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.489
 brain factor to this is what 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.200
 I extracted from my experience 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.940
 if you have things to add if you are not 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.540
 agree with some points write it 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.950
 in the comments 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.930
 don't forget to share the 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.849
 video and resign me like and sign up 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.209
 to the channel all those things that are 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.660
 they say 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.660
 Hello
