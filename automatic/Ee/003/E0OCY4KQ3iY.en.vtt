 privilege of the miners have more 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 qualified online at the right time is in 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 mine is the state that reflects mines is a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 reference in Brazil in its history in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.300
 their culture and all this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.420
 the last information and what you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 production is the essence of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.140
 economic growth of the state 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 social development that information 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 that with information people make their 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 so more options to correct so 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.330
 I want to compliment you on the boldness 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 investments that made me know 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.439
 which are not few and for the privilege that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.689
 the miners will now also have the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.590
 open channel is with skilled work 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.060
 that of you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 in an interview with the journalist 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.439
 osvaldo reis the known little one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 during the sport news program 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.390
 transmitted live criticized the selection 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.340
 and the organization of the new 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 I think mine time is too much. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 short of confederations 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.509
 or the game with the personal side of cbf 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 but still telling me that it does not stay until 14 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.759
 even to not have a very strong pressure 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 does not have to result in the team now 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.409
 playing on too much pressure as he 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 think it is reasonable that you already have a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.329
 stability so that it stays up to 14 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.799
 Prepare it's for the cup we're going to pass. 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.540
 suffocate the tops of the confederations have not 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.730
 standard of play I was the first guess 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.670
 that our part of access had problems 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.100
 the smallest turning point in this exclusion area 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.860
 they call in the km km does not exist 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.660
 this is nonsense since fifa 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.060
 anyway but I think this test served 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.800
 to make these adjustments in relation to the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.630
 mine miner even though I think 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.000
 things work reasonably well 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.420
 with clear patches with good weather will 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.420
 to happen
