also<00:01:44.850> has<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> lot<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> nice<00:01:45.479> amenities<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
also has a lot of nice amenities like a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.530 
also has a lot of nice amenities like a
rod<00:01:47.310> holder<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.850> example<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
rod holder for example and there's a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.850 
rod holder for example and there's a
couple<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> places<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.590> put<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
couple of places that you can put the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.300 
couple of places that you can put the
rod<00:01:50.040> holder<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.909> has<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> tackle<00:01:51.990> box<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.710> cable

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
rod holder it has a tackle box a cable

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.300 
rod holder it has a tackle box a cable
wrap<00:01:53.490> system<00:01:54.200> even<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> transducer<00:01:55.740> holder

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
wrap system even as a transducer holder

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
wrap system even as a transducer holder
in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.540> nice<00:01:57.750> float<00:01:58.140> holding

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
in the back a really nice float holding

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
in the back a really nice float holding
handle<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
handle and I think that's one of the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.660 
handle and I think that's one of the
things<00:02:00.390> most<00:02:00.659> anglers<00:02:01.049> note<00:02:01.380> about<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
things most anglers note about the the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.459 
things most anglers note about the the
ultra<00:02:03.390> pack<00:02:03.570> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> pull<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> out<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
ultra pack when you pull it out of the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.830 
ultra pack when you pull it out of the
box<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.070> very<00:02:05.430> substantial<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.600> well

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
box it's very substantial it's very well

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199 
box it's very substantial it's very well
built<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> great<00:02:08.940> piece

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
built it's a it's a really a great piece

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.580 
built it's a it's a really a great piece
of<00:02:09.420> merchandise<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.319> why<00:02:10.440> they

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of merchandise so I can see why they

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
of merchandise so I can see why they
call<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> ultra<00:02:11.340> pack<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
call it the ultra pack because it is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.860 
call it the ultra pack because it is
truly<00:02:12.480> truly<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.349> alt

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
truly truly the alt

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.949 
truly truly the alt
in<00:02:14.159> pack<00:02:15.159> systems<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:15.879> holding<00:02:16.180> your<00:02:16.299> Vexilar

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
in pack systems for holding your Vexilar

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.890 
in pack systems for holding your Vexilar
now<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.830> FL<00:02:18.370> 12<00:02:18.760> unit<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.239> comes<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.599> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
now the FL 12 unit that comes with the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.800 
now the FL 12 unit that comes with the
system<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.769> very<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:22.120> nice<00:02:22.420> piece<00:02:22.659> of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
system is a very very nice piece of

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.960 
system is a very very nice piece of
technology<00:02:23.409> I<00:02:23.590> think<00:02:24.159> one<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> things

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
technology I think one of the things

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
technology I think one of the things
you'll<00:02:25.150> notice<00:02:25.569> most<00:02:25.780> about<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.409> guess<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
you'll notice most about it I guess the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.369 
you'll notice most about it I guess the
way<00:02:27.099> it's<00:02:27.280> related<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.790> most<00:02:28.180> anglers<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.930> that

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
way it's related to most anglers is that

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.300 
way it's related to most anglers is that
this<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.549> FL<00:02:30.819> 12<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.599> flatscreen<00:02:32.530> version

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this the FL 12 is the flatscreen version

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.199 
this the FL 12 is the flatscreen version
of<00:02:33.670> an<00:02:34.030> FL<00:02:34.299> 8<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.680> FL<00:02:35.980> 8<00:02:36.159> has<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.760> classic

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
of an FL 8 the FL 8 has a the classic

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.850 
of an FL 8 the FL 8 has a the classic
Sun<00:02:37.510> hood<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.900> comes<00:02:38.140> over<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.470> front<00:02:38.680> it's

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
Sun hood that comes over the front it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.710 
Sun hood that comes over the front it's
kind<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.129> hard<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.489> see<00:02:39.819> because<00:02:40.090> he<00:02:40.540> has<00:02:40.659> to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
kind of hard to see because he has to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.539 
kind of hard to see because he has to
look<00:02:40.840> straight<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:41.769> it<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.310> works

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
look straight on with it and it works

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.880 
look straight on with it and it works
well<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.909> sunlight<00:02:43.360> but<00:02:43.930> other<00:02:44.140> fishermen

well in sunlight but other fishermen

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.319 
well in sunlight but other fishermen
around<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.280> can't<00:02:45.549> see<00:02:45.760> what's<00:02:45.940> going<00:02:46.000> on

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
around you can't see what's going on

well the great peripheral view increases

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.030 
well the great peripheral view increases
almost<00:02:48.910> by<00:02:49.209> 50%<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.200> viewing<00:02:50.530> angle<00:02:50.859> and

almost by 50% the viewing angle and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920 
almost by 50% the viewing angle and
you're<00:02:51.400> able<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:52.120> what's<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.870> down

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you're able to see what's going on down

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
there from this from the side so it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.400 
there from this from the side so it
makes<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.299> lot<00:02:55.629> more<00:02:55.810> fun<00:02:56.079> for<00:02:56.109> other
