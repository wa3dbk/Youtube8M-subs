called<00:01:06.430> unmanned<00:01:07.060> vehicle<00:01:07.660> University<00:01:08.320> and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
called unmanned vehicle University and

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.529

for<00:02:09.579> how<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.729> UAV<00:02:10.119> works<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.630> especially

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
for how the UAV works and especially

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.660 
for how the UAV works and especially
when<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.590> doesn't<00:02:11.799> work<00:02:12.100> they<00:02:12.400> know<00:02:12.519> how<00:02:12.640> to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
when it doesn't work they know how to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.220 
when it doesn't work they know how to
troubleshoot<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.299> really<00:02:13.690> gave<00:02:13.870> us<00:02:14.079> an

troubleshoot it really gave us an

these<00:02:18.440> drones<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.100> do<00:02:19.280> hands<00:02:19.790> off<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:20.150> going

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
these drones can do hands off it's going

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.580 
these drones can do hands off it's going
to<00:02:20.330> try<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.540> hold<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> same<00:02:20.990> position<00:02:21.470> in

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
to try to hold the same position in

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
to try to hold the same position in
altitude<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.460> be<00:02:22.490> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
altitude there's going to be the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.760 
altitude there's going to be the
sophisticated<00:02:23.210> UAVs<00:02:23.600> with<00:02:23.840> flight<00:02:24.080> plans<00:02:24.380> and

sophisticated UAVs with flight plans and
ground<00:02:25.100> stations<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:25.910> there's<00:02:26.030> going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
ground stations and then there's going

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.910
