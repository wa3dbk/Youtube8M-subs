00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.440
 diot legacy home i hope you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 listen well it's going quiet 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 new video on call of duty ghost 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 for a new cream strike 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 this time the gloves is found on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.550
 the map 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 whiteout with the ringed hours so 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 it's true that badgers are 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.300
 really a weapon that we see a lot 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 on youtube and even a lot on the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.810
 Multiplayer also is there bah 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.130
 a thing that I find quite a shame 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 since it is true that the community does not 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 do not diversify too much at the level 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.559
 hips chose me personally 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.239
 this is the first time of air on my 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.590
 channel that I propose a gameplay 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.940
 with leonie badge hours so certainly 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.649
 it's a gameplay one badges 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.180
 hours so a small team that m strike 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.260
 you're going to say well here's there really 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 nothing exceptional the little 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 particularity of this gameplay 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.059
 it is simply that we find ourselves 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 in a particular way a little bit 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.270
 which is the team death match 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.190
 so it's true that the match to death by 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
 team is not necessarily a way of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.789
 game that we see very often on youtube 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.530
 since we are going to say that it is a mode of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.910
 game with a fairly limited time to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 women the time it is 10 minutes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 but often we will say that the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 precisely the game mode stops 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.299
 well yeah finally vis-à-vis the number of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 kills and not vis-à-vis time all 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.060
 simply empty you have to know good everything 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.500
 that I think you all know I do not 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 you learn nothing but hey we know 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 never therefore the mm stops at 75 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.650
 that of team is to say that by 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.270
 example you really have to swarm 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.979
 or so really have aisles of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 noob and can just take your 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 time to make your series 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.470
 whether it's calm m nuclear on the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 other call of duty and moab and his 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 grounds anyway you see from 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.329
 what am I talking about the mates and then that's it 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.220
 so listen in this video means 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.930
 as I said we are left with the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 badgers so it's obviously 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.840
 solo as usual no less 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 really very rare that I propose you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 group games most of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.860
 time bah listen I play solo and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 it's really not something that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.159
 just do not like what I'm getting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.320
 like a more focus me in mag and 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.180
 so provide you get out of the real ones 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 excuse me can you get out of 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.939
 things still more correct what 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 so allowed me today all 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.600
 simply to be able to offer you this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.799
 gameplay no we end up on the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.060
 Sunday chain by the way I did 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.430
 not specified but this gameplay 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 finally at least this video will arrive 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.829
 only on the channel and not steam 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.660
 not on my youtube channel 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.830
 besides the mates if you see that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.670
 I do not speak too hard it's just that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.590
 I do not want to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 woke up all mukarak and so I'm doing 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.190
 this little video simply 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.360
 Ben for bread just for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.920
 to pass without the team chain elsewhere 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 I hope this video will make you 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.340
 pleasure 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.510
 and then here are the guys so listen to it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 in this video I'm just going 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.470
 choose a small enough interactive topic 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.520
 it's going to be a little question I 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.170
 I'm going to ask you so do not hesitate 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.970
 not to respond to comments and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.140
 give your opinion me personally I 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.000
 will give mine in this video 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.200
 so for this one will say they would 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.550
 disagree ballet space 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.230
 comments is here for that we will say 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.610
 that's going to be a style of debate you 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.650
 will each be able to give your opinion 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.670
 and I think the reviews will not be 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.110
 all the same facts at least that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.190
 would really surprise me so do not hesitate 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.750
 especially not to post a small 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.580
 comment by giving your opinion on the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.870
 little topic already on the one hand that I 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.760
 chosen in this video that will you 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 allow to interact again 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 with me and then simply 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 give your opinion on the assets 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.049
 call of duty ghost specialist in 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.250
 comparison with those of mw3 since 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 today it's just going to be 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.280
 the little subject of the day is what you 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.080
 prefer the advantages of call of duty 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.299
 finally the advantages call of the specialist call of 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.489
 duty ghost at the specialist level of 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.110
 modern warfare 3 so I'm going a little 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.540
 give my opinion and clarify all 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.920
 so listened to the first thing me 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.310
 personally that I find a big 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.510
 big dots taken somehow finally 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.420
 it's not necessarily a big point 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.890
 by ghost if we will say a point that is 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.420
 quite mixed on both sides 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.739
 to say that I personally there I 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.100
 will give an example from so many 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.109
 other 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.760
 there is an asset that I hate 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.799
 to use with the sniper that's all 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.670
 just cough tracker I do not know 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.260
 if you even have a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.549
 destabilization at the level of your shoot 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.070
 but for example when scop we have 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.190
 really a displacement anyway 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.600
 a lot more we will say 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.769
 fast here is precisely so you have a 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.970
 much faster travel and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.910
 that's what will allow you a little 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.859
 little to be destabilized according to me so that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.900
 it was really mostly on a w3 the 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.220
 type of msr ​​with tracker once one 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.510
 is a specialist it was really a 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.980
 big brothel like here is for example 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.989
 for all the other sniper I'm not going 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.880
 quote that the msr anyway you see 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.560
 of casseneuil scared I want to talk so 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.390
 a big point in my opinion taken by ghost 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.280
 next by following excuse me the weapons 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.600
 so we use the asset choices 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.630
 we want and can put in 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
 specialist then a big point 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.440
 just negative for me on this call 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.920
 of duty ghost that's precisely I know 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.560
 I think so not what I mean 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.210
 the number of kills needed to by 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.100
 elsewhere for example to unlock a 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.630
 asset see for example pass passes on 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.400
 unlocks to two that they then by 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.710
 featherweight example to two they too 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.480
 end ready no it seems to me that it's okay 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.190
 it allows to aim faster after a 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.540
 sprint it's a kid so that for me 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.560
 it's really assets that are 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.020
 totally useless 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.430
 finally at least the number of unlock and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.230
 according to me really useless everything 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.300
 simply because we will say that ben 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.160
 that's what it values ​​that devalues ​​a 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.320
 little less the trumps for me there are 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.060
 really important assets that are 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.830
 for example sometimes a little too much 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.910
 high ie that like for example 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.860
 had two lynxes when you're on a 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.230
 map on strike zone in light so there 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.750
 where you finally go this moment you go 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.390
 just need some balls 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.710
 precisely to kill an amazed enemy of 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.930
 Lynx will you really do it and 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.710
 in my opinion, to unblock it 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.570
 they know 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.870
 here we are going to say that it's really not 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.220
 inevitably the hair an asset excuse 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.570
 I therefore put me in passing the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.250
 guys if I do not know if I already said 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.390
 but if I do not speak very hard it is 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.770
 simply because he's really 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.660
 late at home there was really needed 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.130
 a video on the channel so steam 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.140
 I kindly offered with this 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.340
 so short gameplay at the level of the subject of 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.940
 comments and we're just going there 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.950
 come back and so buddies at the level of 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.570
 strengths and so of mw3 let's say that 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.540
 for me I really also had a 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.010
 big point taken by mw3 put on by 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.420
 example that we use the snipe with 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.410
 tracker goodnight my opinion is just 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.180
 matter of habit 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.830
 and for me it was really something 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.850
 sick we were overpowering limit who 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.500
 have unlocked all our assets 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.850
 specialists there was really something 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.380
 well compared to ghost is that we 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.480
 unlock and all our specialist assets 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.730
 to seven or eight who according to if you 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.600
 use determination or not so he 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.220
 is true for me it was 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.050
 really very big point a very big 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.270
 point excuse me taken by ghost since 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.430
 in a w3 we really do not devalue 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.380
 all the advantages that is to say that by 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.790
 eg tracker air snipers a 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.020
 asset that I would have loved to see again 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.850
 on ice but unfortunately there is 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.830
 hacker is not our snipers 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.900
 good trigger assassin passes pass 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.700
 was we going to tell everyone of equal value 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.190
 we did not unlock force necessarily 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.750
 snipers at 3 kills a bang 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.860
 buy as well as it is it's in front at 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.720
 town me it's really a big mess 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.040
 in call of duty ghost and so that one 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.540
 there is really no value at the level 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.070
 assets which blocks all in 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.870
 same time ie 7 or 8 kg 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.610
 maximum and for me there really was 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.840
 something that was great is that 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.520
 we could only select 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.099
 three primary strengths so 1 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.479
 we unblock to 1 that the host to 3 kg 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.160
 trace a course we had our assets 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.979
 specialists at 7 and that was really 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.330
 in my opinion some of the best things 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.009
 precisely this call of duty modern 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.389
 warfare 3 is a pity besides that this 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.860
 do not be the same on call of 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.240
 duty ghost no we will say that it changes 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.680
 a little bit and it allows everything 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.509
 simply to select the assets 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.310
 specialists we only want to have 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.900
 from our class and then here are the guys 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.190
 so listen to the video coming to an end 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.810
 I hope in any case that she will 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.159
 will have pleased if that's the case you can 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.300
 put a small lake a small comment 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:01.099
 it's always a pleasure 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.690
 this analysis is coming soon 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.870
 for a new video go ciao all 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.870
 the world 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.600
 no
