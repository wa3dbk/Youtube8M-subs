really<00:02:47.910> think<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.180> card<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
really think on this card it's so

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.809 
really think on this card it's so
annoying<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.069> basically<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.549> graph

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
annoying because it's basically a graph

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.220 
annoying because it's basically a graph
but<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.180> blows<00:02:51.299> up<00:02:51.480> you're<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.200> know

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
but it blows up you're like you know

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890 
but it blows up you're like you know
your<00:02:52.440> opponent's<00:02:52.769> feel<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.450> kind<00:02:54.810> of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
your opponent's feel it is kind of

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.390 
your opponent's feel it is kind of
something<00:02:55.200> threatening<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> don't

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
something threatening but if you don't

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490 
something threatening but if you don't

too short my battle you can special them

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.030 
too short my battle you can special them

another fire few months from your deck
so<00:03:05.190> that's<00:03:05.370> where<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.549> feel<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so that's where I feel that it's just a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.809 
so that's where I feel that it's just a
little<00:03:07.049> bit<00:03:07.230> 20<00:03:07.470> p<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.760> just

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
little bit 20 p I think that it's just

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.759 
little bit 20 p I think that it's just
too<00:03:09.000> good<00:03:09.150> especially<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> circle

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
too good especially because of circle

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.589 
too good especially because of circle
the<00:03:10.860> fire<00:03:11.010> kings<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.430> hate<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.910> card<00:03:12.180> whenever

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the fire kings I hate this card whenever

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.089 
the fire kings I hate this card whenever
someone<00:03:12.959> uses<00:03:13.230> us<00:03:13.380> i'm<00:03:13.560> kind<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.010> disappointed

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
someone uses us i'm kind of disappointed

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.759 
someone uses us i'm kind of disappointed
because<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:15.209> kind<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.450> too<00:03:15.599> good<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.440> it

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
because it's kind of too good but it

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.620 
because it's kind of too good but it
allows<00:03:17.010> them<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.310> essentially<00:03:17.940> otk<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.390> too

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
allows them to essentially otk you too

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.000 
allows them to essentially otk you too
so<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.109> talk<00:03:19.290> about<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.500> fire<00:03:19.650> monster<00:03:19.799> you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
so you talk about a fire monster you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.110 
so you talk about a fire monster you
control<00:03:20.070> one<00:03:20.430> fire<00:03:20.609> monster<00:03:20.910> you're<00:03:21.060> gay

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
control one fire monster you're gay

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.340 
control one fire monster you're gay
right<00:03:21.269> destroy<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.690> monster<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.230> control

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
right destroy that monster you control

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.259 
right destroy that monster you control
it<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.980> do<00:03:23.100> suppose<00:03:23.400> someone<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:24.060> other

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
it if you do suppose someone that other

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.759 
it if you do suppose someone that other
monster<00:03:24.660> from<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.109> graveyard<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.620> can't

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
monster from your graveyard you can't

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.830 
monster from your graveyard you can't
activate<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.519> them<00:03:26.820> per<00:03:26.970> turn<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.660> kind

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
activate one of them per turn so it kind

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.780 
activate one of them per turn so it kind
of<00:03:27.900> prevents<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:28.859> from<00:03:28.890> doing<00:03:29.190> act<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.489> super

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
of prevents you from doing act a super

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.460 
of prevents you from doing act a super
otk<00:03:30.180> which<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.569> spammed<00:03:30.870> these<00:03:31.049> over<00:03:31.350> and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
otk which is just spammed these over and

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.800 
otk which is just spammed these over and
over<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.670> know<00:03:32.790> definitely<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.569> just

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
over but you know definitely it's just

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.460 
over but you know definitely it's just
you<00:03:34.049> can<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.470> another<00:03:34.739> 2700<00:03:35.489> damage<00:03:36.470> you

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
you can get out another 2700 damage you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.979 
you can get out another 2700 damage you
know<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.650> attack<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.400> use<00:03:38.549> your<00:03:38.850> tack<00:03:39.299> with

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
know you attack then use your tack with

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.599 
know you attack then use your tack with
you<00:03:40.109> like<00:03:40.230> your<00:03:40.440> guru<00:03:40.950> necks<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.280> just

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
you like your guru necks and just

activate it and get out another grown

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.660 
activate it and get out another grown
because<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.739> doesn't<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.010> any<00:03:44.190> restrictions

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
because it doesn't have any restrictions

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.250 
because it doesn't have any restrictions
on<00:03:46.280> what<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.459> go<00:03:47.880> for<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.900> doesn't

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
on what you can go for like it doesn't

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.319 
on what you can go for like it doesn't
say<00:03:49.350> except<00:03:49.799> for<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.040> same<00:03:50.220> monster<00:03:50.670> but<00:03:50.850> so

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
say except for the same monster but so

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.460 
say except for the same monster but so
you<00:03:51.389> can<00:03:51.690> technically<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.049> for<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.319> same

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
you can technically go for the same

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.400 
you can technically go for the same
monster<00:03:53.060> like<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.450> same<00:03:54.600> another<00:03:55.139> copy

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
of it in the graveyard so it's pretty

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.809 
of it in the graveyard so it's pretty
nasty<00:03:56.900> 2700<00:03:57.900> attack<00:03:57.930> twice<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.620> then<00:03:59.310> other

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
mean I feel like I thing is most of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.440 
mean I feel like I thing is most of
stuff<00:04:43.950> has<00:04:44.130> already<00:04:44.310> gotten<00:04:44.520> rent<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.060> even

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
is just not expensive anyways other than

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.210 
is just not expensive anyways other than
like<00:05:00.540> duality<00:05:01.140> maybe<00:05:01.350> I<00:05:01.620> think<00:05:01.920> that's<00:05:02.070> like

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
like duality maybe I think that's like

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.730 
like duality maybe I think that's like
the<00:05:02.340> only<00:05:02.370> like<00:05:02.820> good<00:05:03.210> reprint<00:05:03.840> other<00:05:04.620> than

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
the only like good reprint other than

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.050 
the only like good reprint other than

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
structure deck and you could actually

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.680 
structure deck and you could actually
just<00:05:48.900> use<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.410> but<00:05:49.970> more<00:05:50.970> than<00:05:51.120> likely<00:05:51.180> you're

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
just use it but more than likely you're

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.820 
just use it but more than likely you're
going<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.870> need<00:05:52.080> three<00:05:52.380> to<00:05:52.560> like<00:05:52.680> actually

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830
