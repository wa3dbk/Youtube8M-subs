them<00:01:09.930> through<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.439> autoclave<00:01:11.100> let's<00:01:12.000> slide

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
them through the autoclave let's slide

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
them through the autoclave let's slide
that<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> look<00:01:13.950> at

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that out of the way and take a look at

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
that out of the way and take a look at
the<00:01:15.150> individual<00:01:15.630> matrices<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:17.540> come<00:01:18.540> close

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the individual matrices now come close

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
the individual matrices now come close
here<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.159> see<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.610> they're<00:01:21.119> pretty

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
here so you can see these they're pretty

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
here so you can see these they're pretty
small<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> smallest<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.400> for

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
small this is the smallest one for

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.590 
small this is the smallest one for
interiors<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:26.070> again<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.450> want

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
interiors and again what you would want

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.640 
interiors and again what you would want
to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.500> match<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.310> size<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.720> matrix

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to do is to match the size of the matrix

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.960 
to do is to match the size of the matrix
for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> size<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> restoration<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:34.970> then

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
for the size of the restoration and then

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140 
for the size of the restoration and then
once<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:37.470> used<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> particular<00:01:38.700> size

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
once you have used up a particular size

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
once you have used up a particular size
you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.659> order<00:01:40.020> refills<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you can order refills of just a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.260 
you can order refills of just a
particular<00:01:42.390> size<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.670> let's<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> look

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
particular size and let's take a look

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
particular size and let's take a look
here<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:47.180> premolar<00:01:48.290> also<00:01:49.290> useful

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
here here is the premolar also useful

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.270 
here here is the premolar also useful
for<00:01:50.159> some<00:01:50.610> interiors<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.520> molar<00:01:53.869> band

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
for some interiors and the molar band

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.560 
for some interiors and the molar band
well<00:01:56.280> we're<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> closer<00:01:57.390> look

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
well we're going to take a closer look

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.539 
well we're going to take a closer look
at<00:01:57.930> these<00:01:59.630> handle<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:02.119> let's<00:02:03.119> take<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> look<00:02:03.869> at

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
at these handle and let's take a look at

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.940 
at these handle and let's take a look at
the<00:02:05.570> posterior<00:02:06.570> band<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the posterior band here it's probably a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.639 
the posterior band here it's probably a
little<00:02:08.099> easy

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
little easy

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.750 
little easy
to<00:02:08.860> see<00:02:09.129> being<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.939> bit<00:02:10.060> larger<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to see being a little bit larger you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.479 
to see being a little bit larger you
can't<00:02:12.760> see<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.480> film<00:02:14.260> here<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:15.010> edges

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
can't see in the film here but the edges

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.850 
can't see in the film here but the edges
of<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.180> matrix<00:02:16.510> are<00:02:16.930> thinner<00:02:17.470> than<00:02:17.709> this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
of this matrix are thinner than this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.460 
of this matrix are thinner than this
Center<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.549> what<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.299> allows<00:02:19.629> is<00:02:19.659> when<00:02:20.349> you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
Center and what that allows is when you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.069 
Center and what that allows is when you
when<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:20.890> press<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.700> matrix<00:02:22.390> up<00:02:22.659> against

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
when you press this matrix up against

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the restoration and force the access out

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.189 
the restoration and force the access out
the<00:04:44.010> top<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.550> aclu's<00:04:44.880> ledge<00:04:45.150> where<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:45.870> much

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
the top the aclu's ledge where it's much

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.870 
the top the aclu's ledge where it's much
easier<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.860> clean<00:04:47.070> up<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.490> wouldn't<00:04:47.729> want

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
easier to clean up you wouldn't want

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.770 
easier to clean up you wouldn't want
that

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
that

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.620 
that
that<00:04:49.110> flash<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.680> be<00:04:49.830> extruded<00:04:50.610> sub<00:04:51.180> gently

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
that flash to be extruded sub gently

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.150 
that flash to be extruded sub gently
it'd<00:04:51.720> be<00:04:51.810> very<00:04:51.840> difficult<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.889> get<00:04:53.010> that

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
it'd be very difficult to to get that

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.550 
it'd be very difficult to to get that
out<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.340> there<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:53.729> by<00:04:54.270> rolling<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.110> up<00:04:55.229> on<00:04:55.440> the

out of there so by rolling it up on the
tooth<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.520> squeezes<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.510> excess<00:04:57.840> out<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.139> top

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
tooth it squeezes the excess out the top

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.870 
tooth it squeezes the excess out the top
where<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.680> easy<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.950> clean<00:04:59.160> up<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.520> then<00:04:59.610> you

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
where it's easy to clean up and then you

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.450 
where it's easy to clean up and then you
cure<00:05:00.240> directly<00:05:01.050> through<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.650> think<00:05:01.919> if<00:05:02.280> I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
cure directly through that I think if I

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.969 
cure directly through that I think if I
move<00:05:02.700> my<00:05:02.910> hands<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.389> a<00:05:03.570> little<00:05:03.780> bit<00:05:03.900> here<00:05:04.169> get

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
move my hands just a little bit here get

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.350 
move my hands just a little bit here get
