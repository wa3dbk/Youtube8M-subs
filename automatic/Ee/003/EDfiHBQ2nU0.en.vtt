00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 so why 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.620
 yet everyone knows I bother her as much 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.620
 worse with that of China the facts for a few years 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.419
 if we shouted these atoms we are together all those who feel good 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.539
 honored ap the family of hydrogels named the family of oxygen 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.430
 family carbon family choice they grew by 7 4% 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 from all as well as retype denouncing the next September 30 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.130
 and an oxygen atom and I have the smallest bit of possible we start again 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.990
 when we put all together and it makes the year 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.630
 but it would not be serious 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.720
 to make salt I'm going to look for sodium anatole mokri anatole 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.460
 October 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 and it makes a lot of laughs of those who have shown envy I am happy 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.469
 files with young people but you have to think 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.329
 if all the atoms of the same family are alike why is there so 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.329
 of uranium retouching and energy and it is not believed 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.320
 a derision knife 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.700
 in trio we went a little too fast 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 the family atoms come back all look like twins 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.910
 sector 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.930
 if we had a small place that the procedure koumac we would have seen 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 customers so he has a bigger mass these bicycles books 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.880
 but also 3g the authority of the water it should be long rome in the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 ruling family it's the same there are two kinds of main uranium 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.340
 if I leave alone 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 our trumps my little piece to see what's inside it gives me 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.400
 even smaller pieces 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.490
 particles 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.219
 courage flee from particles 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.949
 then to be surprised, there are only three kinds of particles 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.490
 here's the point 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.189
 it is positive it has a luxury electric charge it has a mass 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.479
 ap 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.629
 here is the content it is neutral usa united a massacre like the couple 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.630
 here are the readers 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.600
 christian which is a negative charge in fact it is much lighter 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.870
 see with his three kinds of critters 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.729
 we can redo all the assets that exist in nature and even 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.129
 some record profits provided they do not put as much 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.230
 of negative electrons that positive proton to balance the load 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.329
 electric art 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.599
 do not take a pole and an electron 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.140
 we have the simplest and the lightest asset of the universe the hydrogen ap 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.759
 in the group but three years later we find this is a little pub or 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.620
 hydrogen 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.049
 the local hydrogen of earthlings 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.819
 if I add that this is a record of troops would not have any 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.679
 hydrogen 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.799
 a book I do not smoke or two other 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.149
 the price if the man 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149
 but it does not fit very well 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.309
 these young women become too early 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.079
 I am obliged to add a second electoral 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.389
 it pulls very well 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.969
 and it's not at all young 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.049
 it's a gentleman from the family next door his name is elliott n now 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.359
 that you understood you can continue yourself add proton-k 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.849
 electro neutron 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.500
 and you still get pretty big with 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.189
 92 'electro 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.949
 at 92 30 euros 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.149
 with 143 points on the clock 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.579
 that is to say a jersey of 235 particles 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.310
 then you recognized it is the reign of 135 3 me and for no longer 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.309
 to go out in Germany of 138 his twin brother 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 we could certainly add that one does not turn anymore 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.930
 something would happen
