bit of hail action on the outside just a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.260 
bit of hail action on the outside just a
much<00:04:08.190> brighter<00:04:08.400> here<00:04:08.610> I'll<00:04:08.730> throw<00:04:08.970> up<00:04:09.000> that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
much brighter here I'll throw up that

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.479 
much brighter here I'll throw up that
I'll<00:04:10.019> throw<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.410> number<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.800> triple-a<00:04:11.310> one

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
I'll throw up the number to triple-a one

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:12.920 
I'll throw up the number to triple-a one
again<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.209> kind<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> see<00:04:12.630> for

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
again so you can kind of see for

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.009 
again so you can kind of see for
comparison<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:13.950> it'll<00:04:14.220> come<00:04:14.370> back<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.959> okay<00:04:15.959> so

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
comparison if it'll come back on okay so

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.060 
comparison if it'll come back on okay so
that's<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.500> number<00:04:16.769> 21<00:04:18.590> look<00:04:19.590> at<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.799> Wow

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
that's the number 21 look at that Wow

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.099 
that's the number 21 look at that Wow
just<00:04:20.489> flickering<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.030> off<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.419> then<00:04:22.020> this

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
just flickering on and off and then this

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.550 
just flickering on and off and then this
is<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.380> number<00:04:22.590> 31<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.250> black<00:04:24.240> hat<00:04:24.479> one<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.229> we

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
is the number 31 the black hat one so we

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.810 
is the number 31 the black hat one so we
definitely<00:04:25.860> have<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> better<00:04:26.310> light<00:04:26.550> quality

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
definitely have a better light quality

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.680 
definitely have a better light quality
here<00:04:27.180> I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
here I

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.930 
here I
did<00:04:27.810> notice<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.230> little<00:04:28.560> bit<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.980> shaking<00:04:29.760> back

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
did notice a little bit of shaking back

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.050 
did notice a little bit of shaking back
and<00:04:30.150> forth<00:04:30.390> still<00:04:31.170> with<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:32.040> guy<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.490> I

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
and forth still with this guy so I

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.670 
and forth still with this guy so I
actually<00:04:33.330> wasn't<00:04:33.750> carrying<00:04:34.170> this<00:04:34.290> one<00:04:34.440> on<00:04:34.530> my

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
actually wasn't carrying this one on my

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.320 
actually wasn't carrying this one on my
keys<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.220> maybe<00:04:35.400> that's<00:04:35.610> why<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.850> other<00:04:36.120> ones

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
keys and maybe that's why the other ones

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.000 
keys and maybe that's why the other ones
shaking<00:04:36.750> more<00:04:36.960> now<00:04:37.170> because<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.500> had<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.800> on<00:04:37.890> my

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
shaking more now because I had it on my

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.220 
shaking more now because I had it on my
keys<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.400> it's<00:04:38.520> been<00:04:38.720> banged<00:04:39.720> around<00:04:39.870> for<00:04:40.200> a

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
keys and it's been banged around for a

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.480 
keys and it's been banged around for a
few<00:04:40.350> weeks<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.620> there<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.890> maybe<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.340> one

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
few weeks in there and maybe this one

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.590 
few weeks in there and maybe this one
would<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.790> exact<00:04:42.090> same<00:04:42.120> thing<00:04:42.450> who<00:04:42.570> knows

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
would do the exact same thing who knows

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.290 
would do the exact same thing who knows
but<00:04:43.410> finally<00:04:43.980> so<00:04:44.550> this<00:04:44.700> is<00:04:44.730> definitely<00:04:45.030> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
but finally so this is definitely the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.870 
but finally so this is definitely the
brightest<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.930> three<00:04:46.730> finally<00:04:47.730> what<00:04:47.850> I

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
brightest of the three finally what I

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.540 
brightest of the three finally what I
wanted<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.210> show<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.170> last<00:04:49.860> one<00:04:50.220> is

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
wanted to show you is the last one is

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550 
wanted to show you is the last one is
the<00:04:50.670> streamline<00:04:51.090> nano<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.110> twist<00:04:52.410> on

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
the streamline nano this is a twist on

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.950 
the streamline nano this is a twist on
again<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.160> you'll<00:04:54.000> see<00:04:56.750> look<00:04:57.750> how<00:04:57.810> much

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
again and you'll see look how much

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.140 
again and you'll see look how much
brighter<00:04:58.230> that<00:04:58.650> nano<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.100> just<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.430> super<00:04:59.910> cool

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
brighter that nano is just a super cool

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.530 
brighter that nano is just a super cool
super<00:05:00.510> blue<00:05:00.870> light<00:05:01.790> really<00:05:02.790> it's<00:05:03.090> not<00:05:03.480> it's

super blue light really it's not it's

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.110 
super blue light really it's not it's
not<00:05:03.810> as<00:05:03.960> much<00:05:04.140> of<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.410> big<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.400> know<00:05:05.490> hot<00:05:05.730> center

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
not as much of a big you know hot center

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.210 
not as much of a big you know hot center
is<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.360> one<00:05:06.540> that's<00:05:07.050> your<00:05:07.200> play<00:05:07.380> one<00:05:07.560> but

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
is this one that's your play one but

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.030 
is this one that's your play one but
it's<00:05:08.340> just<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.610> tiny<00:05:08.940> tiny<00:05:09.090> tiny<00:05:09.510> little<00:05:09.750> light

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
it's just a tiny tiny tiny little light

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.990 
it's just a tiny tiny tiny little light
it<00:05:11.040> puts<00:05:11.250> out<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.400> lot<00:05:11.700> more<00:05:12.000> like<00:05:12.300> LED<00:05:12.750> quality

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
it puts out a lot more like LED quality

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.390 
it puts out a lot more like LED quality
just<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.210> like<00:05:15.420> really<00:05:15.780> just<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.590> big<00:05:16.950> wide

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
just just like really just a big wide

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.840 
just just like really just a big wide
beam<00:05:18.140> compared<00:05:19.140> to<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:19.560> Triple<00:05:19.920> A<00:05:20.010> one<00:05:20.220> so

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
beam compared to this Triple A one so

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.430 
beam compared to this Triple A one so
I'm<00:05:21.150> really<00:05:21.390> impressed<00:05:21.660> with<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.050> streamline

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
I'm really impressed with the streamline

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.170 
I'm really impressed with the streamline
a<00:05:22.470> no<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.740> have<00:05:22.980> to<00:05:23.010> say<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.460> them<00:05:23.580> all<00:05:23.790> I<00:05:23.820> think

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
a no I have to say of them all I think

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.560 
a no I have to say of them all I think
this<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.510> best<00:05:24.840> quality<00:05:25.850> it<00:05:26.850> shows<00:05:27.390> up

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
this is the best quality it shows up

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.890 
this is the best quality it shows up
very<00:05:27.870> blue<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.650> can<00:05:28.800> see<00:05:28.980> in<00:05:29.100> this<00:05:29.160> video<00:05:29.900> but

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
very blue you can see in this video but

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.980 
very blue you can see in this video but
again<00:05:31.740> for<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.010> size<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.730> all<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.570> think

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
again for the size and all that I think

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.900 
again for the size and all that I think
this<00:05:34.140> one<00:05:34.290> is<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.650> best<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.700> just<00:05:35.850> thought

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
this one is the best and I just thought

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.400 
this one is the best and I just thought
I'd<00:05:36.090> let<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.270> know<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.510> can<00:05:36.900> get<00:05:37.050> some<00:05:37.230> pretty

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
I'd let you know you can get some pretty

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.830 
I'd let you know you can get some pretty
cheap<00:05:37.620> flashlights<00:05:38.300> but<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.360> don't<00:05:39.570> know<00:05:39.690> that

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
they're going to be the answer because

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.960 
they're going to be the answer because
you<00:05:41.430> could<00:05:41.580> end<00:05:41.790> up<00:05:41.910> with<00:05:42.740> cr123a<00:05:43.740> light<00:05:44.730> you

you could end up with cr123a light you
could<00:05:45.060> end<00:05:45.240> up<00:05:45.360> with<00:05:45.600> I<00:05:46.560> don't<00:05:47.280> know<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.640> some

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760
