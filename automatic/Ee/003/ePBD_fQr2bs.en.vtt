00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Welcome to the let's play of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.259
 300 rise of an empire your glory is waiting 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.769
 I'm of that is once again 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.960
 mobile game now for the upcoming movie 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 300 and we jump the same right in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.540
 the battle and catch the first one 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540
 level up 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.090
 the whole game is unfortunately only very short 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.470
 So you will only follow four for the time being 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.470
 can see from the play 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 The game simply serves as a teaser for 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.590
 the upcoming movie 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.900
 but of course I do not want it for you 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.309
 withheld even if it is short 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.280
 is good, it definitely makes a lot 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.960
 fun and I can not do it here 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.300
 somehow just do not do that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.820
 we now here together put them together 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.320
 attacked and the ships are just 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.830
 not so easy when the area of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 just arrive 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.479
 Pages 1 from all sides we can 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.440
 we can do normal attacks as well 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.220
 To block 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 with our shield will block or enter 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 Shield strike is also quite good and 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 such a really nice finishing move 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 we'll get there, too 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.790
 really nice 300 the part 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.470
 how it works in kinofilm so 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:39.190
 it also works on mine here 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.399
 canal so easy times head-on the ship 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.399
 R.A.M 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.890
 but that is the consequence already 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.890
 over again does not write 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 thought that's who super short 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.830
 been no sorry people 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.420
 we have two more minutes yes that is 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.000
 So not the problem of the game so 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.470
 There were many many negative reports 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.619
 So about the game itself is good yes 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.070
 but is just over there too fast 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.770
 now the moment would have come 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.280
 that's the and build now, so to speak 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.950
 come let's see how this still a 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.300
 can delay a bit here 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.270
 every case that such a finishing move 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.700
 Do such a thing for example and so 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.690
 Shield strike we have to make it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.690
 all nice extra points 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.980
 53,000 points is just not like that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.680
 there is a lot 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.710
 he has somehow so many more points 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.610
 Rarely ever saw anyone so much 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.390
 points it to players 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.760
 he probably already has one 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.780
 played a bit longer and just there 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.710
 founded the high scores up and down 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.550
 but is actually a nice sign 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.960
 for the developer if such a game 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.280
 fun made the people easy 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.230
 to price it up a bit 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.310
 I just hope it really 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.630
 been like that and that he did not 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.690
 somehow through in the pot did 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.690
 to let 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.560
 we can go on here again 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.360
 hardly more persian wish on the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.520
 movie very much looking forward to the last movie 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.770
 Well 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.500
 this is all considered with suspicion 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.350
 just a continuation of a film of 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.860
 that's pretty good for the most part 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.640
 never followers as good as that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.090
 actually original game or the eye 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.090
 the original movie we think so many 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.950
 So many have many 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.610
 fans of the film already a bit 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.350
 fear 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.730
 Gerard Butler is not there either 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.480
 I think he will be in one at most 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.890
 to see a film clip shortly 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:07.090
 but that 's it then 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.910
 beautiful Spartan enters here and now 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.880
 but thank you for watching 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 tomorrow we will see the next episode and 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.280
 then we see like the battle 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.280
 continues against artemis until then 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.280
 Hello
