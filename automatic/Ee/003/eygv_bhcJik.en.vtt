00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.950
 my dear friends, welcome to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.230
 a video of yours from my tibia and 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.420
 we're back with a video of I had 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.130
 after a good time 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.110
 I'm not recording from France but this 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 it does not matter much to the video you can 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.650
 prove that you are here in a group hut 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.630
 in oura monde where is a city 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.600
 relatively new is already working 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.040
 already in the game for a while but a lot 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 people believe that I still did not know 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.879
 right 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.320
 This is a high level anti -gang group. 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:58.730
 a gift people do in closed group of 461 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.129
 level 200 plus quina type and 2% of 250 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.860
 But I would say the father can go to the 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.950
 software can be between 250 quiet 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.180
 to radio am to start as you 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.040
 arrive there, right? 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.070
 to access this location you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.100
 the time must come when it is time 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.740
 normal way walks really boring and you 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.590
 need to have a ranking with this works 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.780
 this ranking is that neither other places 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.690
 such as the gnomes there 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.190
 amazon but everything is for you to have access 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.470
 to some things in the city you need 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.490
 of reputation points and that works 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.290
 same way 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.940
 so there are several techniques you can 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.820
 do where to earn points 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.340
 reputation is that point they count as 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 votes and these votes you can vote 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.850
 in the next respawn of that location is 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.160
 Who is this night, everybody votes on this one. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.660
 responds that he is seeing the support 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.040
 but hardcore that's where the guys like it 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:03.470
 to pass and you need to accumulate 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:06.200
 that to 50 points of trust loyo 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.119
 of the population of gold to the hill and you have 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 access is this report that leads to 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.510
 this place is good both there and it is 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.710
 Does this work, I have decided to separate 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 It's this video in two 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.080
 because there are at the meeting in 2000 there are 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.810
 two parts of this hut 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.620
 You can or hunt on that match is there. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.890
 now that is the ash and west west left 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.260
 of the rival that for this sport is very 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.450
 big then give a lot gives quietly 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.790
 for 22 teams tired in each of a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 side without interrupting this is too big 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.780
 I'ts very interesting 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.990
 there you will find kind of diverse 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.270
 rage monsters will find of torture 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.170
 and defendants paulo is destroy rip is real round 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.150
 demo is a bunch of bug izmir 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.990
 will also take into account all 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.870
 hibiscus so well traditional in the bugs 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.960
 support 15 this is the question already is well 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.000
 known to us and what is so 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.000
 interesting in this hut 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.970
 if you watch you watch everything 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 This maybe I can not see in the video but 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.890
 I'll tell you guys, you'll know the person in charge. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.980
 here it is random so always type 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.350
 that you enter a room is can have a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.140
 is a different endorsement or it may have 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.680
 once two demos and three of ipi can 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.870
 once having a torture round 5 what 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.180
 makes hut much more interesting a lot 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.840
 more dynamic in my view at least 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.550
 So I think this is a very strong point of 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.120
 where and how is it a good night 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.940
 fun is good action with you can see 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.460
 we do it 's people it's home she who 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.670
 had time to take a deep breath which in 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.260
 take it all in 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.850
 eight bugs 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.680
 We 're falling in the good mood because the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.620
 most monsters they do not pass 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.500
 just good here's only the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.960
 destroyers and we gave them to them if 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:15.390
 deception between the good and the corner the droid 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:17.850
 software gets one is attacking in rolling and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.739
 the priest who is my function as the sound 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.350
 father is relatively weak because of this 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.040
 reason has no moral to stop the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.990
 rest of the respawn then the physical type is the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.820
 my job is to stay inside the bomb and 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.160
 possibly when you have a 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.230
 a destroyer one of one on top of one of 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:39.270
 I'll go there for a month and try to get out of it. 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.830
 take the focus off the gaucho is good you 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.780
 You want to know the numbers, it's talking about the frog. 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.040
 cool giant you think you know 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.640
 that art is very cool 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.500
 Let's talk about numbers, is this hut there ? 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.770
 I can make between 2.5 and 2.7 kaka time 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.300
 it is a higher level makes three kaka time 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.400
 and type easily 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.650
 It's like it's one of the first times 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.470
 that I was and I was such a son around 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.420
 of 2.5 2.7 which is more or less the same 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.910
 experience you will make in rock or 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.950
 So that's noel there may be an option to 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.530
 purple or purple may be an option there 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.710
 understood is another place very similar 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.190
 with the same style of rock house 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.140
 just called it somewhere else, right? 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.330
 the other another place that may be 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.730
 empty may be empty i prefer 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.180
 I'd rather rather stay 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.970
 go out hunting rochamar bathroom there more 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.470
 depends on your 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.690
 The hellish and expensive profit has no way 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.480
 stay these are the bugs that send 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.690
 money that rains chubut man I do not 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.460
 I can tell the average profit because that 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.260
 depends a lot on ram prasad with whom 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.080
 Are you hunting depends on whether your environment 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.830
 management if your bank spends it this 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.430
 It varies a lot from team to team but 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.600
 to draw in a hut there of 50 100 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.520
 quiet profit you know so it's a rage 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.920
 I like very much I enjoyed the 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.810
 to do that now when I play I'm 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.110
 starting to play again now that I 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.430
 I managed to get people and 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.180
 my friends are also returning to 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.640
 little 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.400
 I want to go back to the old maggi a lot 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.550
 Fuck a lot of the way, that 's it. 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.530
 as on the hut with focuses hunt is 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.030
 very simple at the same time we do not have 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.160
 still none is as I already said 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:35.250
 we make a turn clockwise 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.610
 and counterclockwise and will enter the rooms 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.040
 How did I say that on the in and the sound system 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.969
 with you can see in the course of the video 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.509
 as 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:47.399
 and on the way back, we go back inside the 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.429
 room and we will go to the 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:53.399
 No way too much trouble for the eye. 

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:53.849
 of the other team because it is well divided 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.339
 in June 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.429
 and I do not even know if it 's 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:01.949
 that I show the other side that way I 

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:03.539
 I'll stop asking you if 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.909
 would you like me to make a 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.669
 second video showing the other side of the 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.959
 range because it is basically the same thing 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.699
 only on the other side 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:13.439
 you want what i can i can do 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.169
 another video as is some info 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.789
 I missed here that I did not even know 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:23.069
 I would like to know about startup can I 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:25.379
 give too right and that's it guys 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:27.569
 the first video still from France that 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:29.639
 coming back a little bit I know I'm 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:34.559
 Maybe I may have lost my hand, I do not know. 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:37.019
 if there's still a way for this I 'm 

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:39.569
 readapt the channel here in my 

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:41.519
 new recording condition that is a bit 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:43.079
 different from what I was used to 

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.800
 that's it you have enjoyed 

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:50.699
 your favorite artist you want to be 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.769
 You want a defendant, that 's it. 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.769
 until the next guys said
