00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:10.860
 are making appear and they are 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 the owner of luca with wesel 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.369
 Charlie the two girls are learning today 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.189
 at yvonne how to donkey before it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.580
 A walking tour around Osnabrück is on 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.680
 It also notes that this is very 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 are nice and that they are not so full 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 are how you think the donkeys are the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 joyfully down like run like yvonne 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 Businessman knows it has a training 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 and there I have two completely 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.320
 charming island gets to know me 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 have immediately pulled in their spell and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.930
 I 'm from the classic 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 riding and have never been like this before 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 really had something to do with donkeys 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.149
 there it just happened to happen to me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 I would like to have two own donkeys now 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.110
 have and then I searched 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 for a suitable alternative like me 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.309
 the donkey can deal well and there 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.629
 I am a nature lover myself and also 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.070
 my dogs a lot in the forest on the way 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.930
 why not just with the example 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.469
 meanwhile, donkeys are going hiking 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.129
 charlie and max for children's birthday parties 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.010
 therapy purposes and for the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 School lessons booked because 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 there are hiking trails around osnabrück 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 enough and also the lead of the long ears 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.260
 is not difficult 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.330
 In any case, if you are in noble 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.280
 let wash once on grass because would like 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 the island again and again to axel nawrath 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.700
 the shrub shrubs are just one 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.219
 true delicacy 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.219
 because even if the animals are not in the forest 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.490
 charlie is also an art piece 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.380
 always to have 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.659
 see through a very fast so the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.819
 Remember exactly when you try them 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.060
 to pull away if they are longer then 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.939
 breath and defend more against it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 and do not want to come along that many 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.490
 then people give in and not 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.750
 your own point of view makes that clear 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.039
 is very important when you are with 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.170
 walking together is that exactly 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.729
 think beforehand what do you want something 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.470
 You do not want to because the white donkey 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.119
 me right from the start 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.220
 is convinced that the absolute 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.020
 so they are free to go 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.759
 fear situation quite different than 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.920
 horses they analyze first stay 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.390
 stand and consider worthwhile before 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.799
 are afraid or not afraid angst 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.420
 and then they decide for 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.709
 autonomously what is the right one 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.560
 decision is that has me from the beginning 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.280
 also fascinated by nina and luca are 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.900
 Loved the donkey trekking tour 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.549
 that is something else with wise 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 a dog goes for a walk and also 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.530
 really nice was fun or 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.329
 through because maybe it's 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.940
 not the last time that the girls 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.940
 go hiking with the donkeys
