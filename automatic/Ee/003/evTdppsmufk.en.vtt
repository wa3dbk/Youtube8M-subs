Gil was also talking to people via he

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480 
Gil was also talking to people via he
was<00:01:19.259> answering<00:01:19.619> questions<00:01:20.040> believe<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> or

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
was answering questions believe it or

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.039 
was answering questions believe it or
not<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.790> Twitter<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.420> being<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:21.780> honest

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
not on Twitter and being pretty honest

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
not on Twitter and being pretty honest
with<00:01:22.200> people<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.640> stay<00:01:23.820> very

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
with people they want to stay very

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
with people they want to stay very
practical<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> reason

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
practical with this so and the reason

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
practical with this so and the reason
for<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.470> animatronics<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.680> real

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
for that is that animatronics are real

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
for that is that animatronics are real
and<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.060> makes<00:01:30.210> them<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and that's kind of what makes them so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
and that's kind of what makes them so
scary<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> take<00:01:31.680> away<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.100> element

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
scary so if you take away that element

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
scary so if you take away that element
you<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.060> losing<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> level<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you are losing that level of could this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
you are losing that level of could this
thing<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.340> alive<00:01:35.880> could<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.420> sentient<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
thing be alive could it be sentient is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.480 
thing be alive could it be sentient is
it<00:01:37.079> looking<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.530> me<00:01:37.560> doesn't<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> hurt<00:01:38.280> me

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it looking at me doesn't want to hurt me

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
it looking at me doesn't want to hurt me
doesn't<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> kill<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.590> adds<00:01:41.100> more

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
doesn't want to kill me it adds more

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670 
doesn't want to kill me it adds more
mystery<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.229> puppets

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
mystery I think I like when it's puppets

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
mystery I think I like when it's puppets

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.190 
monsters I
it<00:02:45.340> looks<00:02:45.760> more<00:02:46.030> convincing<00:02:46.780> than<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.050> old

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
stuff is scarier well because I mean

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.070 
stuff is scarier well because I mean
we've<00:02:51.640> had<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.240> argument<00:02:52.420> before<00:02:52.720> about

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
we've had this argument before about

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.750 
we've had this argument before about

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
does technology take away from horror

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640 
does technology take away from horror
doesn't<00:02:55.360> make<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.600> things<00:02:55.870> less<00:02:56.080> scary<00:02:56.410> and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
doesn't make it things less scary and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.440 
doesn't make it things less scary and
more<00:02:56.800> convenient<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.790> less<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
more convenient and have less of that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.030 
more convenient and have less of that
mysterious<00:02:58.840> factor<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.590> what's<00:02:59.770> going<00:02:59.950> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
mysterious factor of what's going to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.070 
mysterious factor of what's going to
happen<00:03:00.340> next<00:03:00.520> gun<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.630> when<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:01.840> have

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
happen next gun and I think when we have

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.050 
happen next gun and I think when we have
you<00:03:02.380> know<00:03:02.530> an<00:03:02.590> animatronic<00:03:02.920> with<00:03:03.490> its
