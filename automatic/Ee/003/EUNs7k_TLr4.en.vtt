00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.110
 do you know what they're under there are there 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.040
 alternatives 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.900
 animal experiments can we 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 the two conclusive results thanks to the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.530
 experiments 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.290
 we can find products 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.250
 not tested on animals 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.480
 what are the numbers of 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 animal experimentation 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.310
 the treatment 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.330
 animals exceeds all we could 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:10.370
 imagine torture and the ears of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.670
 cuts and burned alive electric shock 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.720
 drowning forced oxygen deprivation 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 sleep creating aggression anxiety 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 of madness hypertension by compression or 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.119
 open wound artery injuries 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.310
 transplantation head transplant or 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.369
 of tumor organs caused by 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.610
 cancer shots produced by substances 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.680
 chemical forced drug absorption or 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.740
 of alcohol taking blood samples in the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.520
 heart all this while the animal is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.520
 still conscious 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.500
 and if I told you that we can 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.300
 all these tortures and if I you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.430
 cited alternatives such as 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.030
 cell biology toxicogenomics 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.300
 bioengineering medical imaging the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 in vitro research so liot us 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.790
 can choose between an animal or 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.790
 new methods 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.700
 the fronts 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.319
 alternatives are not just the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 saving animal lives 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.190
 these methods are also less expensive 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.270
 and with quick results and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.270
 much more reliable 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.000
 the anatomy the girl 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.820
 home and the metabolism of animals and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.860
 humans are very different even 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.020
 different animal species can 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.700
 react completely contrary to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.490
 a chemical or at a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.860
 drug from the results 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.400
 of experiments carried out on 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.710
 animals 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.510
 therefore it is not possible to predict whether 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.050
 a human being will react so 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.000
 identical or differently 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.400
 do not forget that many 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.770
 drugs considered safe on 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 the basis of experimentation practiced on 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.540
 the animals have had harmful effects and 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.830
 even mortal in humans 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.810
 they are proof that he is not 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.210
 possible to transpose with reliability 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.760
 the results of experiments on 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.930
 animals to humans 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.260
 did you know that certain medicines 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 like aspirin and ibuprofen 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.800
 insulin the penicillin or the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.520
 phenobarbital would not exist if one 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.050
 relied on animal experimentation 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.150
 these drugs cause serious 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.710
 damage to certain species because their 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.710
 metabolism is different from ours 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.950
 thankfully there are pharmacies 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.780
 who sell untested products 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.060
 you can also find these products 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.140
 in special stores like nature 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.000
 health biocoop naturalia very often 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.990
 in small shops or non bio 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 she specified 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.730
 we can find untested products 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.530
 to recognize them you have to look 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.810
 in the product description to 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.670
 the back and look for the no indication 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.670
 tested on animals or this symbol 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.609
 end of 2013 there 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.140
 and his seventh report on 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.939
 statistics concerning the number 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.739
 of animals used for purposes 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.599
 experimental and other purposes 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.750
 scientists in the member states of 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.790
 the European Union 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.949
 11.5 million animals used them 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.859
 most used species are the 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:24.060
 mouse for 60 96 % 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:27.090
 rats for 13.96 % blood animals 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.220
 cold example amphibian reptiles and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.910
 fish for 12 47% and the birds for 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.849
 5.99% but also the horses the halls 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.580
 pigs goats sheep and goats 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.560
 cattle accounts for 1.2 percent 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.160
 to carnivores among others dogs 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.310
 and cats 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.030
 it represents 0.25 percent of the number 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.220
 total animals used 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.509
 60% of the animals were used for 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.550
 research and development purposes 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.039
 in the fields of human medicine 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.720
 veterinary medicine of the 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.500
 dentistry and in studies of 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.500
 basic biology 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.750
 the question is so can we be 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.850
 for animal experimentation 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.790
 must we continue must we 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.740
 accept if the man wants to evolve he 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.930
 will also have to look at the methods they 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.030
 use to get those results that 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.550
 are supposed to provide answers to these 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.770
 questions because you have to evolve 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.600
 ethically and realize that we 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.320
 do not have the right to trade lives 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.320
 for answers
