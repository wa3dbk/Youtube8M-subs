00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 many patients get one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.160
 mrt-examination contrast agent that triggers 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 sometimes uncertainty out of there a few 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 cent often little under contrast agent 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.889
 can imagine and what this medium 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.889
 actually should effect 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.730
 In this movie I want to talk about 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.439
 Contrast agents speak like it in the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.210
 magnetic resonance imaging is used in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.690
 round or in computed tomography 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.790
 or even with the cardiac catheterization of it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 very different contrast agent 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 used contrast agent is a clear 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.320
 Odorless liquid in vials 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.289
 or spray it is a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 prescription drug that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.680
 submitted in pharmacy to radiologists 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210
 will each be prescription 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.320
 drug requires an official 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 permission for what you use now 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 actually contrast means an important one 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.619
 Application is the presentation of the vessels 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.850
 the one very fast and very accurate 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.729
 can represent 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
 because the contrast agent at the beginning in the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.060
 remains and not in the rest 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.210
 Body tissue can come through it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.000
 remaining body organs the vessels yes 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.020
 superimpose images very well 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 suppress 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 After that, the contrast agent is distributed 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 everywhere in the body especially where 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.020
 that's a lot of blood 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.790
 often pathological processes like 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 inflammations or tumors 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 this is what the radiologist can do with it 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.790
 better contrast and contrast means 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.829
 arrange better 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.479
 especially the contrast agent is included 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.700
 diseases in the brain or in the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.370
 nervous system such as spinal cord 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.650
 because the healthy 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.040
 brain and the spinal cord 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.670
 contrast agent absorbs this differently 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.920
 as for example in the liver or the kidneys the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.200
 yes contrast media record very well 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.840
 I have you here again a picture 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.230
 example brought here you see one 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.190
 layer on the brain in the amount of havel 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.190
 the left picture you see the brain and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.170
 there certainly can not be a vision 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.460
 demarcate on the right picture you see 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.640
 but clearly a wise that is good 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.220
 Contrast agents absorb the region 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 In this case, this is due to small tumor 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.990
 This makes it excellently healthy 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.220
 brain tissue delimits those who are not 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.340
 can administer contrast medium though 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.970
 The radiologist recommends it benefits 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.650
 so not from the improved 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.350
 diagnostic options the contrast agents 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.890
 in the marking or assessment of 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.810
 can offer pathological processes 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 There is a manufacturer of contrast agents 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.709
 meanwhile many such as bayer vital 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.560
 formerly known as sharing hp or 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.080
 also general electric or bracco around 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.050
 some of the more important manufacturers once 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.520
 to name the name 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.810
 you'll probably become one now 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.830
 ask why did I have the last 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.760
 mrt examination a contrast medium 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.690
 receive 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.910
 and now it is all at once necessary everyone 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.910
 Radiologist did in the conduct of 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.790
 nuclear spin investigations legal 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.290
 to observe guidelines 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.200
 However, these guidelines are not 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.100
 completely state but every radiologist 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 has a certain 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.880
 of course the decision of 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.810
 Radiologist to radiologist may vary 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.580
 contrast agent is not just one 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.650
 chemical substance but a 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.959
 and can be like any other medicine 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.290
 Medicines, too, for example 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.120
 paracetamol or a cough syrup 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.100
 of course also side effects 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.810
 This will help you in the Enlightenment 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.860
 radiological practice for yours 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.150
 Examination then takes place even more precisely 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.840
 It would also give the frame 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.570
 blow up this movie now 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.690
 But what is important in medicines 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.350
 is usually between very common 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.270
 frequent occasional rare and 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.850
 very rare side effects 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.500
 distinguished 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.500
 This is the manufacturer of the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.330
 Contrast agent in the so-called 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.640
 This information for physicians though 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.820
 also for patients in a slightly different form 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.670
 are shown in more detail 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.790
 You can be such a technical information 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.440
 Also download on the internet and it 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.960
 may be handy if you are 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.230
 interested in being closer to this 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.270
 before looking at it 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.980
 some patients are surprised too 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.290
 before with you for example at 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.870
 family doctor blood is removed 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.419
 under blood will be determined 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.840
 all such blood will be the 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.150
 determine kidney function 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.120
 in some contrast agents it is 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.820
 such blood values ​​prescribed at 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.900
 other contrast agents are those of 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.830
 only recommended to the manufacturers 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.419
 it is also important for patients that me 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.780
 round contrast as you go 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.919
 an example of kidney x- raying for the kidney 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.800
 Computer tomography or for cardiac catheter 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.020
 be applied by 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.810
 Kernspin contrast agent as we here 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.820
 have discussed essential 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.310
 distinguish 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.560
 So round contrast products always contain 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.340
 In contrast, jot is a contrast agent in mrt 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.200
 iodine present 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.570
 I hope I have you a lot 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.940
 to say interesting about contrast agent 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.470
 can and of course you the fear 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.450
 before the contrast agent at the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.060
 magnetic resonance imaging 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.760
 you will be in practice where 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.740
 examination then takes place once again 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.530
 informed in detail and of course 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.020
 also enlightened as always with youtube 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.169
 if you liked the movie again 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.240
 Give me a like thumbs up and up 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.240
 the next movie at
