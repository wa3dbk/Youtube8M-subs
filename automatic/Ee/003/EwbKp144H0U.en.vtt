00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
so I don't

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660 
so I don't
when<00:01:41.040> exactly<00:01:41.760> but<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.650> guess<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> few

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
when exactly but it was I guess a few

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.390 
when exactly but it was I guess a few
years<00:01:44.970> ago<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.040> really

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
years ago and it was really really

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.539 
years ago and it was really really
inexpensive<00:01:48.619> probably<00:01:49.619> around<00:01:49.799> 20<00:01:50.369> dollars

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
inexpensive probably around 20 dollars

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.570 
inexpensive probably around 20 dollars
or<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.710> sure<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.190> able<00:01:53.280> to
