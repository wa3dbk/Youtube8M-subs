00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 very good guys here we are in another 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.259
 more video for the channel in this case os 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.089
 I bring a million which I will say 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.189
 five tips to drive better in 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.050
 gta 5 and good guys before starting 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.610
 tell you that these 5 tips are 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.019
 pretty simpletons and facts for 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.460
 beginners who do not know yet 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.199
 drive very well so I hope not 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.430
 I get soiled by comments like that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.109
 you win guys then having said that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.430
 let's start the first advice that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.859
 I'll give is that when braking 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 never brakes with the r1 button and always 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.039
 brakes with the button l 2 why then 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.810
 because when we brake with the button the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 fingers what they do the wheel of the car is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 slow down bit by bit and when you learn 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 with the button r1 the wheels of the car is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.329
 so to speak they are totally blocked 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.790
 true then the car what it does is 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829
 slip and it's very difficult to control the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 car so remember without presenting with 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 the button the fingers and never with the r1 the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 second advice that I am going to give you is that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.180
 when you are going to turn on a curve, 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.829
 you offer what you have to do is that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.360
 a considerable distance 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 before reaching the curve what 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 we have to do is drop the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
 accelerator and when you get to the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.210
 bend then catch this curve pretty 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 easily because the speed will be 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 reduced by releasing the accelerator on 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 time before reaching the curve because 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 I recommend this as well because you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 you will lose less time in taking the curve 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 yes yes 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.259
 what the car does is that the car 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.579
 have to restart the march and 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.500
 then you are going to take more time 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.149
 in taking the curve the third council that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.189
 by the way it's pretty short is that 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.630
 never turn to the maximum because then because 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.220
 if it's not going to happen like in the council 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.899
 number 1 that the car will start to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.939
 slide and you will not be able to have the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.470
 control over the car the fourth council 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.909
 is that you use the third camera to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.649
 drive because from my point of view 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.479
 is the best because then because the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.189
 first camera we can not see the part 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 rear of the car thing that comes very badly 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.759
 the second camera in the camera is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 too close to the goods of the car 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.759
 and we can not have a good overview 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 of what comes to be the landscape so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.789
 we will not be able to solve the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 problems that are put in our 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.289
 way and the fourth camera the car is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 too far from what will be the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.740
 camera and then well I sincerely 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.569
 I do not keep very well the control of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 car in that camera therefore I deduce 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.689
 which is the best camera and the one I 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.159
 I use today is the third and the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.599
 fifth and last advice that by the way 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.159
 it's something more personal is to say that 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.049
 some will find it more comfortable and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.090
 one will find it more uncomfortable is that 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.920
 I for example when I'm going to overtake 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.380
 a car or when I'm going to take a curve 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.759
 or when for example I have before five 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.899
 five people cars as we are 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.130
 playing the load I have to overtake 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.180
 to all or also when we go by 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.920
 example for some 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.390
 highway a super speed and we have 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.079
 in front of a lot of car and we have 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.750
 to avoid them, since I sincerely 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.790
 it is much more comfortable with the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.859
 right joystick move the camera so 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
 to do the screen and put it up 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.639
 of the car and then why would you be 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.139
 like he handled the car better and I do 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.540
 better the maneuver if I know how to 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.799
 I calculated a little better and it hit me less 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.389
 Sometimes the truth is much more 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.829
 comfortable when making maneuvers that 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.120
 camera does not put the camera a bit 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.650
 more for you for giving the right click 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.090
 down and you'll see that as I say 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.379
 it is much more comfortable so nothing 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.269
 guys, basically, this has been 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.159
 everything if you want another five tips from 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.180
 some or other thing about you to 5 so what 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.650
 The only thing you have to do is to put it 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.909
 the comments so nothing then I hope 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.319
 how liked you liked to like
