then you can remove the moving blade

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.599 
then you can remove the moving blade
from<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.890> well

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
from there as well

from there as well
in<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.720> plate<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> be

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
in this plate is what we're going to be

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
in this plate is what we're going to be
adjusting<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.030> we're<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> loosen

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
adjusting so we're just going to loosen

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
adjusting so we're just going to loosen
these<00:00:34.350> screws<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.190> move<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> plate<00:00:35.940> float

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
these screws and move this plate float

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.639 
these screws and move this plate float
forward<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.640> moving<00:00:39.059> blade<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> lies

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
forward so that the moving blade it lies

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.450 
forward so that the moving blade it lies
more<00:00:41.370> closely<00:00:42.170> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> edge<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.190> guide

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
more closely with the edge of our guide

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.540 
more closely with the edge of our guide
blade<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.600> get<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> closer<00:00:46.079> cut<00:00:46.550> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
blade so that we get a closer cut so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.290 
blade so that we get a closer cut so
you're<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.120> your

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
you're just going to take your

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.290 
you're just going to take your
screwdriver<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:50.340> barely<00:00:50.579> loosen<00:00:51.180> these

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
screwdriver and just barely loosen these

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.160 
screwdriver and just barely loosen these
two<00:00:51.360> screws<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> hold<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> plate<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:55.050> order

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
two screws that hold that plate in order

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.610 
two screws that hold that plate in order
to<00:00:55.410> turn<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:58.140> barely<00:00:58.469> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to turn it that much just barely just

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.180 
to turn it that much just barely just
enough<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> we<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.730> uh<00:01:00.350> we<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.379> maneuver

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
enough so that we can uh we can maneuver

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.359 
enough so that we can uh we can maneuver
written<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.850> set<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> we're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
written and set it how we want so we're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.920 
written and set it how we want so we're
going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.670> ahead<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> take<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> moving

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going to go ahead and take the moving

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.270 
going to go ahead and take the moving
blade<00:01:07.140> throw<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
blade throw it back on there and as you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
blade throw it back on there and as you
can<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:12.210> able<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:14.280> move<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
can see I'm able to to move it now so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
can see I'm able to to move it now so
you'll<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> flat<00:01:17.070> surface<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you'll you want a flat surface and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
you'll you want a flat surface and
you'll<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> take<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.290> lie<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you'll just want to take this and lie it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
you'll just want to take this and lie it
flat<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:29.930> then<00:01:30.930> once<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
flat like so and then once you do that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
flat like so and then once you do that
you'll<00:01:31.740> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.689> angle<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> little

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you'll kind of want to angle it a little

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
you'll kind of want to angle it a little
bit<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:34.920> want<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> moving

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
bit because you don't want the moving

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
bit because you don't want the moving
blade<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> exact<00:01:36.540> same<00:01:36.659> height<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
blade to be the exact same height as the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.760 
blade to be the exact same height as the
guide<00:01:38.310> plate<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.990> potential

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
guide plate because as the potential

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
guide plate because as the potential
that<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.310> cut<00:01:41.549> yourself<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that you can cut yourself you know the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
that you can cut yourself you know the
moving<00:01:42.630> blades<00:01:42.840> pretty<00:01:43.079> sharp<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.009> if

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
moving blades pretty sharp so if it's if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
moving blades pretty sharp so if it's if
it's<00:01:44.850> too<00:01:45.030> close<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.689> you'll<00:01:46.020> irritate

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's too close you know you'll irritate

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
it's too close you know you'll irritate
your<00:01:46.890> skin<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.399> cut<00:01:47.790> yourself<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
your skin you can cut yourself so you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
your skin you can cut yourself so you
just<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> angle<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.649> so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just want to angle it a little bit so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
just want to angle it a little bit so
that<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.000> little<00:01:51.720> bit<00:01:51.899> underneath<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that it's a little bit underneath the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.280 
that it's a little bit underneath the
guide<00:01:52.890> blade<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.820> exactly<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.049> same

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
guide blade and not exactly the same

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.920 
guide blade and not exactly the same
height<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.899> worse<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
height or it will be worse if it's

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.410 
height or it will be worse if it's
taller<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> guiding<00:02:01.710> guide<00:02:02.100> blade<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
taller than the guiding guide blade so I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.469 
taller than the guiding guide blade so I
just<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> lay<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.549> flat<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
just so you just want to lay it flat and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.290 
just so you just want to lay it flat and
just<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.840> angle<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:09.119> from

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
just kind of angle it and then from

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.510 
just kind of angle it and then from
there<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.080> take<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> screwdriver

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.390 

and<00:02:15.520> tighten<00:02:16.510> these<00:02:16.630> screws<00:02:16.690> again<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:21.160> then

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and tighten these screws again and then

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.300 
and tighten these screws again and then
just<00:02:21.640> kind<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.880> take<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.120> look<00:02:22.360> at<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:25.120> see

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.010 

see<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.550> looks<00:02:30.700> right<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.570> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.840> run

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
see if it looks right it's kind of run

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.050 
see if it looks right it's kind of run
your<00:02:32.170> finger<00:02:32.500> across<00:02:32.590> here<00:02:33.160> if<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.030> feels

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
your finger across here if it feels

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.080 
your finger across here if it feels
smooth<00:02:35.040> that's<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.190> good<00:02:36.370> thing<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> feels

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
smooth that's a good thing if it feels

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.350 
smooth that's a good thing if it feels
kind<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.450> rough<00:02:37.660> like<00:02:37.960> these<00:02:38.200> teeth<00:02:38.560> are<00:02:39.360> above

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
kind of rough like these teeth are above

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.350 
kind of rough like these teeth are above
the<00:02:40.570> guide<00:02:40.780> blade<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.580> that's<00:02:42.760> not<00:02:42.940> good<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the guide blade then that's not good you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.050 
the guide blade then that's not good you
don't<00:02:43.510> want<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.460> may<00:02:45.610> take<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.880> few

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
don't want that so it may take a few

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.080 
don't want that so it may take a few
times<00:02:46.510> before<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.020> set<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:47.470> right<00:02:48.090> but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
times before you set it just right but

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 
times before you set it just right but
that's<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.360> whole<00:02:49.510> principle<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.650> want<00:02:50.830> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
that's the whole principle you want to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's the whole principle you want to
get<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.940> moving<00:02:52.540> blade<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.590> sit<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:53.980> bit

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
get the moving blade to sit a little bit

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.680 
get the moving blade to sit a little bit
closer<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.910> guide<00:02:55.090> blade<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.570> that's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
closer to the guide blade and that's

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.090 
closer to the guide blade and that's
going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> allow<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.320> cut<00:02:56.530> closer<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
going to allow you to cut closer and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.570 
going to allow you to cut closer and
it's<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.570> cut<00:02:58.570> more<00:02:58.780> precisely<00:02:59.580> so

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
it's going to cut more precisely so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
it's going to cut more precisely so
after<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.260> basically<00:03:02.260> just

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
after you do that basically just

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.190 
after you do that basically just
reattach<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.850> trimmers<00:03:07.020> throw<00:03:08.020> your

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
reattach it to the trimmers throw your

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.620 
reattach it to the trimmers throw your
screws<00:03:08.470> back<00:03:08.800> into<00:03:09.070> those<00:03:09.730> two<00:03:10.000> holes<00:03:10.240> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
screws back into those two holes and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.170 
screws back into those two holes and
then<00:03:11.350> test<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.770> out<00:03:11.890> I'm<00:03:12.190> no<00:03:12.610> tested<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.150> your

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
then test it out I'm no tested on your

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.020 
then test it out I'm no tested on your
skin<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.100> can<00:03:15.310> try<00:03:15.490> it<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:15.700> your<00:03:15.820> arm

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
skin you know you can try it on your arm

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.270 
skin you know you can try it on your arm
or<00:03:16.240> something<00:03:16.570> like<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.930> before<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:18.010> try<00:03:18.220> it

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
or something like that before you try it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.630 
or something like that before you try it
on<00:03:18.400> your<00:03:18.520> hair<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:21.070> like<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.310> said<00:03:21.370> you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
on your hair because like I said you

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.610 
on your hair because like I said you
don't<00:03:21.760> want<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:23.080> don't<00:03:23.200> want<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.470> cut

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
don't want to you don't want to cut

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.800 
don't want to you don't want to cut
yourself<00:03:23.770> if<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.670> adjust<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.150> too<00:03:25.360> much<00:03:25.570> you

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
yourself if you adjust you too much you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.260 
yourself if you adjust you too much you
know<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.990> can<00:03:26.200> end<00:03:26.350> up<00:03:26.520> cutting<00:03:27.520> yourself<00:03:27.730> or

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
know you can end up cutting yourself or

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.080 
know you can end up cutting yourself or
whoever's<00:03:28.720> here<00:03:29.260> you're<00:03:29.500> cutting<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.130> that's

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
whoever's here you're cutting so that's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.480 
whoever's here you're cutting so that's
pretty<00:03:31.420> much<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.080> like<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.100> said<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.370> might

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
pretty much it so like I said it might

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.770 
pretty much it so like I said it might
take<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> few<00:03:33.850> times<00:03:34.209> before<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.600> get<00:03:34.720> it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
take you a few times before you get it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.410 
take you a few times before you get it
just<00:03:34.990> right<00:03:35.110> but<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.010> will<00:03:36.220> notice<00:03:37.209> a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
just right but you will notice a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.060 
just right but you will notice a
difference<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.350> performance<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.040> your

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
difference in the performance of your

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.560 
difference in the performance of your
trimmers<00:03:39.600> when<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.720> do<00:03:40.870> adjust<00:03:41.260> them<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.570> let

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
trimmers when you do adjust them so let

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.210 
trimmers when you do adjust them so let
me<00:03:43.660> know<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> got<00:03:44.020> any<00:03:44.200> questions<00:03:44.650> I'm<00:03:45.130> an

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
me know if you got any questions I'm an

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.520 
me know if you got any questions I'm an
