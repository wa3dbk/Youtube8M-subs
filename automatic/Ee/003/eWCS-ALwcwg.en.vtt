with a degreaser probably can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.719 
with a degreaser probably can
deteriorate<00:01:11.840> faster<00:01:12.439> than<00:01:12.590> normal<00:01:12.950> or<00:01:13.490> not

grease<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.549> I<00:01:16.579> was<00:01:16.700> guided<00:01:17.000> to<00:01:17.030> give<00:01:17.149> much

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
grease so so I was guided to give much

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.639 
grease so so I was guided to give much
you<00:01:17.509> can<00:01:17.689> out<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.840> there<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.289> can<00:01:18.469> start

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
you can out of there you can start

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
hardly any wear marks at all so it means

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.840 
hardly any wear marks at all so it means
it's<00:01:24.469> been<00:01:24.530> sitting<00:01:24.859> there<00:01:24.889> just<00:01:25.189> fine<00:01:25.399> had

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.040 
you don't damage your bearing
but<00:01:58.150> you'll<00:01:58.270> check<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.660> out<00:01:58.780> once<00:01:58.960> you're

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
but you'll check it out once you're

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
putting that one too you see here we got

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.060 
putting that one too you see here we got
our<00:02:04.300> bearing<00:02:04.660> clear<00:02:04.930> cleaned<00:02:05.290> up<00:02:05.440> here<00:02:05.680> and

like that
chances<00:02:14.560> are<00:02:14.680> you're<00:02:14.890> you're<00:02:15.430> good<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.850> go

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
again check the cage around the bearing

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.750 
again check the cage around the bearing
that's<00:02:19.390> nice

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.080

so on the face around we're good now so

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
so on the face around we're good now so
there's<00:02:28.240> grease<00:02:28.480> contaminating<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.380> one

inside there and then we roll the
rollers<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.390> bit<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.750> get<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.989> all<00:04:01.080> worked<00:04:01.319> in

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
rollers a bit to get it all worked in

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.710
