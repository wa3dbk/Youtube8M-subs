00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
afterwards and you can see um it's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.609 
afterwards and you can see um it's
actually<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.490> stickers<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
actually just stickers take to all the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.510 
actually just stickers take to all the
plastic<00:01:53.180> um<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.740> here's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> close-up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
plastic um well here here's a close-up

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
plastic um well here here's a close-up
view<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> him<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:58.170> sample<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.259> think

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
view of him of sample on it and I think

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.429 
view of him of sample on it and I think
this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:03.240> lot<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.200> last

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this is going to be a lot in my last

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340 
this is going to be a lot in my last
video<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> while<00:02:05.750> because<00:02:06.750> I'm<00:02:07.200> not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
video for a while because I'm not

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.309 
video for a while because I'm not
expecting<00:02:08.009> any<00:02:08.399> order<00:02:08.789> fright<00:02:09.060> now<00:02:09.209> and
