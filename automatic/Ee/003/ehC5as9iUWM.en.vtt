00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 not 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello to all so here is the first 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.480
 tutorial in partnership with crÃ©avia so 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.860
 here I explained to you in my 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.410
 previous video that I had chosen 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 the items of my choice for you 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.310
 propose diarra y on my channel and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.380
 so here is the first one so I'm going to you 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.890
 show how to customize those little ones 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.890
 cardboard pots 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 you need a cardboard weight of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.910
 masking tape of the string so I have 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.970
 selected twine baker twine or 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.280
 equal to two colors of the pearls of 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:53.550
 rocaille of the thread to put on 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 beads of charms so I have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 chose the theme of the sea so I have some 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.780
 big blocks related to this theme and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 glue as I use mask in 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.149
 time by is so the masking tape does not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 not glue directly so a little 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.570
 plastic that protects so I start 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.550
 first by taking the measures of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.800
 montpon to cut just what he me 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.860
 takes intake masks so I cut 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.790
 pieces of light blue and I'm also going 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.920
 hand cut bucket of turquoise blue 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.539
 if ever your mask such a sum to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.460
 normal system and picole directly 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.619
 you can simply directly 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.010
 stick your mask in tech on the weight 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010
 cardboard 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 I will now stick my mask 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.350
 intake all around my pot so I 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.330
 start with the base of the pot and you 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.830
 go see that I'm going to alternate the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.380
 strips to make a turquoise band 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.520
 a blue sky band and I'm going to stick 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.520
 like that 4 of india 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 and the idea that I give you in this 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.130
 dialogue are just suggestions 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.619
 so lifted of course use that a 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 technical or many in association with 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.019
 others of your choice so that's 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.450
 really to give you ideas 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.280
 so after avour either to reproduce the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.470
 same pot as me to pick 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.640
 some ideas can customize the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.640
 bo to your taste 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960
 Yes 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.250
 I'm trying to align well and tape 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.250
 mass leave to make it prettier 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.690
 I stop there for the moment and I 'm going 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.120
 continue with the string I apply a 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.830
 little glue and there I took two 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.630
 pieces of string so there you the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.920
 see a little bit about the zoom that I 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.380
 glue at the same time we are chosen 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.330
 a turquoise color and a color 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.300
 sand or always to call a little 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.090
 my theme which is that of the sea â€‹â€‹and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.280
 I run like that my life that all 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.709
 around my pot by putting glue 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.260
 little by little and so I'm going to stick 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.880
 string I wound bit 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.590
 close four or five rows 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.560
 I will leave just enough room 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.030
 to paste a last strip of 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.930
 masks to cover and it's a small 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.930
 little later in the video 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.730
 that's what it gives for this step 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.470
 so you see that I just stay 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.990
 enough room to stick my last 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.420
 band of muskellunge have chosen to 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.380
 stick blue sky and like just now 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.380
 I go around my handsome 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.470
 I take my nylon thread and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.659
 I realize several is at the end so 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.480
 we'll put on talk about one so that 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.430
 will serve under will only serve to block them I 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.560
 go around my handsome take the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.560
 measure and I cut my film 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 I chose fathers the exit 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.560
 friendly and I put beads just 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 enough to be able to go around the pot with 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.970
 and like just now with the string 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.979
 I put glue and I stick my 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.180
 little pearl necklace all around the 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.650
 pot so do not hesitate to tap 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.180
 with his finger to make sure to adhere 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.180
 the beads in the glue 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.750
 Yes 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.039
 when everything is glued I cut the 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.120
 surpluses of queue and I will come 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.430
 drop a tiny dot of glue 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.910
 for really that and my pearls on 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.830
 my handsome and avoid that his task then 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.020

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.669

 strings of string 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.360
 not 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.880
