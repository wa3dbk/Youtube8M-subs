00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 Adriana 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.740
 cute is merely galicia we have two 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.980
 genres you told me milk the ring 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.349
 clinic and follow the technique allows 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.929
 sublimate two different fabrics of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.570
 polyester of course at the same time 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.429
 it is very nice the colors a combination 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.310
 pretty autumnal 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:38.649
 with the terracotta the yellow but with 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.750
 those pretty ones that good disguises very well 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.480
 we were generators and we listened 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.719
 society more thank you so good morning 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.510
 what we are going to do is sublimation the 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.239
 technique is to paint a paper and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.149
 Once dry, pass it to the fabric through 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 from a heat source that we need 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:02.170
 paper a common computer paper a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.550
 average weight of 75 80 grams or paper 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.020
 poster and on the palette paints for 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.170
 sublimation 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.590
 The line has more than 30 colors 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.460
 that can be mixed together and in addition 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.640
 allows for its excellent pigmentation the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.219
 addition of water to achieve a 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.710
 more watercolor effect simply 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:30.969
 transferred the design let's start to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.049
 paint brush chad or just 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:38.520
 fill is a very loose design 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.500
 orange cadmium yellow 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.780
 particularity of the technique in 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.739
 principle see this by button should not 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.479
 I must match the paint 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:52.179
 feature does not exist on the line 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.149
 white color that's why it's convenient 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.380
 leave unpainted areas because this is going to 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.979
 be our light and also we can not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.489
 sublimate on dark colors other than 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.220
 the characteristics change noticeably 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:11.890
 the color once the iron you moss by 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.930
 that is fundamental our letter of 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.800
 colors on the fabric that we are going to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.260
 use 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.989
 with the same brush 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.909
 orange color let's start to 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.250
 do something similar to what they are 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:30.920
 buildings without having to mix with 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.049
 the colors as well as well in blue from 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.819
 prussia clean a little the surplus 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.069
 violet broken with chocolate for 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.379
 make a brown color I'm just going 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.319
 filling all the paper the 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:52.370
 overlapping colors are going to 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:56.030
 Give other clean tones everything is washed with 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.209
 water and with Prussian blue we are going to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.720
 mark horizontal strokes what 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.680
 would be the water I can add and run the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.170
 painting making it more transparent with 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.069
 Water 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 this has to be dried and once 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.310
 this is dry let's get this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.709
 paper we're just going to draw with 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:30.390
 a round brush and black color we are going to 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:34.769
 draw lines and mark the buildings 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.769
 thus marking all that is doors 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 windows 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.590
 trees 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.590
 and also 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.100
 the boats in the water 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.390
 Just like that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.540
 once we have painted the paper it 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.330
 let it dry we can accelerate its drying 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.590
 with hair dryer let's move on to 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.069
 what is the iron 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.349
 the iron is a common household iron 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.700
 we are going to accommodate the fabric and the 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:18.470
 fundamental the fabric has to have 75% 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:23.039
 acrylic acrylic ring and gauze 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.039
 Once we put the fabric 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.220
 paper that is already painted and with 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.680
 iron at a medium temperature let's 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.639
 start to sublimate then 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:40.020
 fundamental characteristic of the fabric 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.199
 must have polyester 75 percent of 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.650
 polyester without lifting I fixed that 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:52.570
 needs more heat I raise 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:57.100
 and applied pressure and heat in this way 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:05:00.520
 I'm sublimating the two fabrics if we go 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.699
 to sell a little more here 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.930
 once we made up for forgiveness he sublimated the 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.930
 first paper 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.259
 I'm going to move on to our second role 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.710
 I raise this is the possibility that gives me 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:17.090
 sublimation sublimate at the same time 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.990
 two fabrics 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.050
 if with the same painting paint for 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:28.150
 eternal sublimation 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.129
 it lacks heat I lift the iron 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.819
 I press 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:37.059
 besides another feature that has the 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:40.089
 painting is that they are translucent 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:44.289
 colors is to say that I can overlay 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:48.369
 the tones I use the other paper I go back to 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:52.110
 lift I'm going to move and so I'm going to 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:56.399
 sublimate the whole shirt allows me the 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:00.809
 overlay thus achieving other tones 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:04.269
 so I need a common role 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:07.149
 paintings for eternal sublimation and 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:09.749
 a heat source as in this case the 

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.749
 griddle 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.440
 so the design is complete 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.810
 another possibility gives me this painting 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.930
 I put back in the areas where I do not 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:28.480
 it was sublimated it placed again the 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:31.570
 paper and I can apply well more heat and 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.780
 sublimating those sectors if that's how it goes 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.950
 completing the entire shirt of course 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.920
 that the back uses a paper 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:46.660
 with the complete design to sublimate 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.290
 all that is the back see then 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:54.790
 does not lose body or transparency 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:58.440
 the gauze and so we go completing and going 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.440
 sublimating the entire riverbank 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.340
 is freehand simply the idea is 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.740
 here is the full line drawing 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.770
 oblique to give movement something 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.410
 similar to buildings boats to have 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.990
 something different that is not clear 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.370
 You can not totally use your 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.560
 creativity 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.120
 At least that's how we show how 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.820
 the colors remain how are the 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:29.800
 plastic colors or very many beautiful 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:32.229
 thank you beautiful work thank you thank you 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.110
 now we continue with hermes that we 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:37.890
 show the tailor sleeve with the secrets 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.890
 sewing
