00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
skipping the introduction I move on

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.810 
skipping the introduction I move on
directly<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.140> main<00:00:37.980> part<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
directly to the main part of this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
directly to the main part of this
country<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> mean<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> content<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.260> video

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
country I mean the content of this video

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
country I mean the content of this video
so<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.180> set<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> graphical<00:00:43.290> settings<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so here I set the graphical settings to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
so here I set the graphical settings to
the<00:00:43.920> lowest<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.660> resolution<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:46.050> been

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the lowest that our resolution has been

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.549 
the lowest that our resolution has been
set<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.530> 800<00:00:47.219> into<00:00:47.430> 600<00:00:47.940> pixels<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
set to the 800 into 600 pixels and the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.529 
set to the 800 into 600 pixels and the
graphical<00:00:50.010> settings<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> lowest<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
graphical settings are to the lowest and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
graphical settings are to the lowest and
we<00:00:51.719> seen<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.140> been<00:00:52.170> set<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> fall<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
we seen has been set to fall and it is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
we seen has been set to fall and it is
the<00:00:54.449> lowest<00:00:54.870> possible<00:00:55.110> settings<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> can

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the lowest possible settings you can

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.760 
the lowest possible settings you can
have<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> game<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.350> weighing

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have for this game and so on weighing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
have for this game and so on weighing
the<00:00:58.890> game<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.489> lower<00:00:59.760> settings<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> as

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the game now with lower settings and as

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.560 
the game now with lower settings and as
I<00:01:01.379> could<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> particular<00:01:02.570> gameplay

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I could see in this particular gameplay

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
I could see in this particular gameplay
of<00:01:03.660> my<00:01:03.870> night<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> lot

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of my night there were there was a lot

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
of my night there were there was a lot
of<00:01:05.820> improvement<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.540> terms<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.960> graphics<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
of improvement in terms of graphics and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.490 
of improvement in terms of graphics and
ER<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.729> graphics<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.299> mean<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> performance

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
ER not graphics I mean the performance

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.340 
ER not graphics I mean the performance
so<00:01:10.770> I'm<00:01:11.220> having<00:01:12.000> too<00:01:12.119> much<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.840> don't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so I'm having too much so just don't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.429 
so I'm having too much so just don't
mind<00:01:13.560> why<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.950> speak<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.930> okay<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.409> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
mind why do I speak this okay so we just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.359 
mind why do I speak this okay so we just
ignore<00:01:17.159> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
ignore that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
ignore that
so<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.450> mean<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> performance<00:01:19.320> has

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so the I mean the performance has

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.760 
so the I mean the performance has
improved<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.320> what

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
improved a lot and I think this is what

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.929 
improved a lot and I think this is what
you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.009> expect<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> particular

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you can expect from this particular

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.410 
you can expect from this particular
performance<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> processor<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
performance I'm in the processor and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
performance I'm in the processor and
performance<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.600> been<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.470> if

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
performance have been really good and if

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.319 
performance have been really good and if
you<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.159> wanting<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> play<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you are actually wanting to play the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.130 
you are actually wanting to play the
game<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.409> know

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
game and you know

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.649 
game and you know
favorites<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.890> want<00:01:33.130> something<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:34.210> mean

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
favorites and you want something I mean

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.219 
favorites and you want something I mean
you<00:01:34.720> are

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
you are

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.719 
you are
marshal<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.830> performance<00:01:36.370> of<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.580> game

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
marshal to the performance of the game

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.790 
marshal to the performance of the game
we're<00:01:36.880> gonna<00:01:37.150> enjoy<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> graphics<00:01:38.050> then<00:01:38.560> I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
we're gonna enjoy the graphics then I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.530 
we're gonna enjoy the graphics then I
must<00:01:39.280> say<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:40.300> mean<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:41.380> lower<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
must say that I mean you lower the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.060 
must say that I mean you lower the
graphical<00:01:43.540> elements<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.590> settings

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
graphical elements and in the settings

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.640 
graphical elements and in the settings
then<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.670> will<00:01:45.880> have<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.360> perfect

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
then you will have the perfect

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.020 
then you will have the perfect
performance<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.280> expect<00:01:48.850> from

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
performance that you can expect from

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.460 
performance that you can expect from
this<00:01:49.410> processor<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:52.540> getting<00:01:52.840> about<00:01:52.960> 30<00:01:53.229> to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
this processor I was getting about 30 to

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
this processor I was getting about 30 to
40<00:01:53.770> forms<00:01:54.040> per<00:01:54.190> second<00:01:54.550> in<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:55.030> particular

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
40 forms per second in this particular

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.200 
40 forms per second in this particular
these<00:01:58.020> things<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.580> would<00:01:59.850> take<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
these things but I would take the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
these things but I would take the
average<00:02:00.330> to<00:02:00.690> be<00:02:00.810> around<00:02:01.170> 25<00:02:01.710> frames<00:02:02.070> per

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
average to be around 25 frames per

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
average to be around 25 frames per
second<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.840> there<00:02:03.840> were<00:02:03.990> evenly<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:04.650> its

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
second and there were evenly then its

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.010 
second and there were evenly then its
most<00:02:05.430> intense<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.390> heavy<00:02:07.759> graphic<00:02:09.020> fidelity

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
most intense and heavy graphic fidelity

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.620 
most intense and heavy graphic fidelity
of<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.370> mean<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.150> graphical

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
of this game I mean when the graphical

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.050 
of this game I mean when the graphical
elements<00:02:13.020> by<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.230> highest<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.950> mean<00:02:14.310> there

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
elements by the highest I mean there

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.790 
elements by the highest I mean there
were<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.450> lot<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.720> graphic<00:02:16.050> elements<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
were a lot of graphic elements in the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.280 
were a lot of graphic elements in the
screen<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.820> were<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.330> getting<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:18.930> 20

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
screen you were I was getting about 20

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.780 
screen you were I was getting about 20
frames<00:02:19.530> per<00:02:19.620> second<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> lowest<00:02:20.610> was

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
frames per second and the lowest was

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480 
frames per second and the lowest was
about<00:02:21.180> 15<00:02:21.570> per<00:02:21.750> second<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.070> all<00:02:23.190> know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
about 15 per second but as you all know

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.190 
about 15 per second but as you all know
that<00:02:23.520> you're<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.270> high-definition<00:02:25.050> video

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that you're gonna high-definition video

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.750 
that you're gonna high-definition video
has<00:02:26.070> 25<00:02:26.850> frames<00:02:27.209> per<00:02:27.270> second<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.580> see

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
has 25 frames per second so you can see

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.300 
has 25 frames per second so you can see
that<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.810> am<00:02:31.140> saying<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> average<00:02:32.040> was

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that as I am saying that the average was

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.070 
that as I am saying that the average was
about<00:02:32.340> 25<00:02:33.090> frames<00:02:33.330> per<00:02:33.480> second<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.900> can

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
about 25 frames per second then you can

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.050 
about 25 frames per second then you can
imagine<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.100> game<00:02:35.310> runs<00:02:35.340> perfectly

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
imagine that the game runs perfectly

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.930 
imagine that the game runs perfectly
fine<00:02:36.420> calling<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.320> Spitfires<00:02:38.040> part<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.820> you

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
fine calling to me Spitfires part of you

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.270 
fine calling to me Spitfires part of you
because<00:02:39.270> there<00:02:40.080> are<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.230> lot<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.410> people<00:02:40.950> out

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because there are a lot of people out

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.580 
because there are a lot of people out
there<00:02:41.489> who<00:02:42.000> speak<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.510> 60<00:02:43.290> frames<00:02:43.500> per

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
there who speak like 60 frames per

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.940 
there who speak like 60 frames per
second<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.000> perfect<00:02:45.780> following<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.739> game

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
second is the perfect following the game

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.979 
second is the perfect following the game
and<00:02:47.160> stacks<00:02:47.520> me<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.970> don't<00:02:48.300> even<00:02:48.570> understand

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
and stacks me they don't even understand

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.050 
and stacks me they don't even understand
what<00:02:49.140> they're<00:02:49.290> actually<00:02:49.410> taking<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.760> because

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
what they're actually taking for because

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.080 
what they're actually taking for because
it's<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.440> performance<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.760> if<00:02:54.000> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
it's just the performance like if you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.360 
it's just the performance like if you
get<00:02:54.270> about<00:02:54.570> 30<00:02:55.200> frames<00:02:55.530> per<00:02:55.590> second<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.190> game

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
get about 30 frames per second the game

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490 
get about 30 frames per second the game
looks<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.880> same<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.330> perform<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> same<00:02:58.140> in

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
looks the same and perform the same in

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.110 
looks the same and perform the same in
that<00:02:58.680> 60<00:02:59.040> frames<00:02:59.280> per<00:02:59.340> second<00:02:59.670> then<00:02:59.850> itself

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
that 60 frames per second then itself

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.570 
that 60 frames per second then itself
obviously<00:03:00.450> again<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> same<00:03:01.560> game<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.310> it's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
obviously again in the same game on it's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.020 
obviously again in the same game on it's
like<00:03:02.820> if<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.570> play<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.170> game<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.470> 30<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.030> 60

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
like if you play the game at 30 and 60

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
like if you play the game at 30 and 60
it<00:03:06.120> doesn't<00:03:06.390> make<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.750> even<00:03:07.500> much<00:03:07.739> faster<00:03:08.220> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it doesn't make you even much faster you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.680 
it doesn't make you even much faster you
know<00:03:08.570> it's<00:03:09.570> irrelevant<00:03:10.230> actually<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.370> mean<00:03:12.000> if

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
know it's irrelevant actually I mean if

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.970 
know it's irrelevant actually I mean if
these<00:03:12.959> frames<00:03:13.320> per<00:03:13.470> second<00:03:13.799> actually

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
these frames per second actually

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.610 
these frames per second actually
describe<00:03:14.790> how<00:03:15.120> well<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.750> computer<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
describe how well your computer is

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.949 
describe how well your computer is
performing<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.430> not<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.850> how<00:03:18.420> well<00:03:18.690> you

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
performing it's not that how well you

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.580 
performing it's not that how well you
are<00:03:19.140> able<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.709> play<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:19.980> okay<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.420> according<00:03:22.380> to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
are able to play it okay so according to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.059 
are able to play it okay so according to
me<00:03:22.860> 25<00:03:23.459> inches<00:03:23.820> per<00:03:24.000> second

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
me 25 inches per second

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.009 
me 25 inches per second
minimum<00:03:25.459> University<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.150> have<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.840> any

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
minimum University you can have for any

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.500 
minimum University you can have for any
game<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.400> lower<00:03:28.549> settings<00:03:29.030> this

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
game and at the lower settings this

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.569 
game and at the lower settings this
processor<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.319> achieve<00:03:30.739> 25<00:03:31.219> frames<00:03:31.489> per

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
processor can achieve 25 frames per

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.990 
processor can achieve 25 frames per
second<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.379> I<00:03:33.379> think<00:03:34.129> that's<00:03:34.280> all<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.549> had<00:03:34.969> to

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
second so I think that's all you had to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.449 
second so I think that's all you had to
know<00:03:35.269> about<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:36.170> performance<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.129> regard

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
know about the performance in regard

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.119 
know about the performance in regard
with<00:03:37.549> lower<00:03:37.879> settings<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.560> once<00:03:39.799> again<00:03:39.950> I

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
with lower settings and once again I

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.899 
with lower settings and once again I
would<00:03:40.189> like<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.549> thank<00:03:40.849> my<00:03:41.120> mind<00:03:41.569> right<00:03:41.780> for

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
would like to thank my mind right for
