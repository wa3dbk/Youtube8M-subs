figures and for these particular figures

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.310 
figures and for these particular figures
I<00:00:17.940> got<00:00:18.300> them<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.680> wave<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.750> has<00:00:21.750> parts

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I got them in the wave that has parts

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.470 
I got them in the wave that has parts
for<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.859> HK<00:00:23.850> 5-0<00:00:24.600> droid<00:00:26.210> interesting<00:00:27.210> thought

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
for the HK 5-0 droid interesting thought

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
for the HK 5-0 droid interesting thought
on<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.840> waves<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:29.010> figures

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
on these waves is that these figures

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.659 
on these waves is that these figures
keep<00:00:29.640> appearing<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.359> other<00:00:30.570> waves<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
keep appearing in two other waves and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.010 
keep appearing in two other waves and
obviously<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.969> those<00:00:33.180> waves<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.840> have

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
obviously in those waves they will have

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.319 
obviously in those waves they will have
different<00:00:34.290> robot<00:00:34.770> parts<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.489> careful<00:00:35.940> if

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
different robot parts so be careful if

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
different robot parts so be careful if
you're<00:00:36.510> completing<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> HK<00:00:37.410> 50<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.550> want

you're completing the HK 50 and you want
to<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.910> these<00:00:39.059> figures<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.660> sure<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to get these figures make sure that the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.340 
to get these figures make sure that the
parts<00:00:40.469> included<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.570> are<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.960> HK<00:00:43.290> at

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350

parts included with them are for HK at
50<00:00:43.620> obviously<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.399> I've<00:00:45.239> seen<00:00:45.510> them

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
50 obviously because I've seen them

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
50 obviously because I've seen them
released<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.170> other<00:00:46.320> waves<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:46.920> have

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
released in other waves and they have

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.209 
released in other waves and they have
totally<00:00:47.579> different<00:00:47.960> droid<00:00:48.960> parts<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
totally different droid parts and it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
totally different droid parts and it
took<00:00:50.370> me<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> while<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.149> find<00:00:51.860> these

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
took me a while to really find these

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000 
took me a while to really find these
particular<00:00:53.160> figures<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.180> dhj<00:00:54.840> 50<00:00:55.320> or

at this at the same time how the HK 50

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.120 
at this at the same time how the HK 50
anyway<00:00:59.399> enough<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.500> let's<00:01:01.500> begin

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.160 

these<00:01:08.130> are<00:01:08.400> quite<00:01:09.060> interesting<00:01:09.570> figures

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.780 

they're<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:13.590> made<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.159> detail<00:01:14.580> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they're very well made the detail is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.140 
they're very well made the detail is
just<00:01:14.820> amazing<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.670> very<00:01:17.670> unique<00:01:18.439> species<00:01:20.150> or

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
just amazing and very unique species or

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
just amazing and very unique species or
a<00:01:21.240> race<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.900> Jedi<00:01:22.970> not<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.240> usual<00:01:24.420> human<00:01:24.900> Jedi

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a race of Jedi not your usual human Jedi

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
a race of Jedi not your usual human Jedi
he's<00:01:26.040> still<00:01:26.280> humanoid<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:28.530> alien

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
he's still humanoid but very alien

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.060 
he's still humanoid but very alien
looking<00:01:29.900> let's<00:01:30.900> begin<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.909> pro<00:01:32.909> Koon<00:01:33.210> I

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
looking let's begin with a pro Koon I

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.480 
looking let's begin with a pro Koon I
started<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:36.000> noticing<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> character

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
started really noticing this character

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
started really noticing this character
when<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> watched<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> Clone<00:01:39.240> Wars<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
when I watched the Clone Wars and I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.870 
when I watched the Clone Wars and I
really<00:01:41.729> noticed<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> movies<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.880> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
really noticed them in the movies but I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.109 
really noticed them in the movies but I
think<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> major<00:01:46.500> major<00:01:47.340> improvement

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
think this is a major major improvement

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.859 
think this is a major major improvement
from<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> previously<00:01:49.020> released<00:01:49.200> flow<00:01:49.710> kun

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
from the previously released flow kun

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.410 
from the previously released flow kun
ware<00:01:51.869> which<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.549> with<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:54.119> but

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ware which I don't have with this but

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
ware which I don't have with this but
with<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> new<00:01:54.930> figure<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.590> big<00:01:55.799> difference

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with this new figure the big difference

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.940 
with this new figure the big difference
is<00:01:56.430> obviously<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.930> lower<00:01:58.140> garment<00:01:58.680> has<00:01:58.770> been

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is obviously the lower garment has been

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.359 
is obviously the lower garment has been
turned<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.520> into<00:02:00.240> cloth<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:01.200> real<00:02:02.009> cloth

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
turned into a into cloth a real cloth

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.959 
turned into a into cloth a real cloth
and<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.240> molded<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.520> upper

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and it's not just molded in the upper

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.980 
and it's not just molded in the upper
garment<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> still<00:02:06.810> molded<00:02:07.229> in

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
garment is still molded in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.199 
garment is still molded in
another<00:02:08.560> feature<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.190> figure<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.850> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
another feature of this figure is the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.510 
another feature of this figure is the
removable<00:02:10.690> mask<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.080> see<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.520> when

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
removable mask as you can see it when

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.729 
removable mask as you can see it when
you<00:02:15.610> remove<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.209> reveals<00:02:16.630> how<00:02:16.930> blow<00:02:17.470> Coon

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
you remove it it reveals how blow Coon

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.650 
you remove it it reveals how blow Coon
actually<00:02:18.160> looks<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.640> his<00:02:19.300> species<00:02:19.630> at<00:02:20.020> least

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
actually looks like his species at least

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.240 
actually looks like his species at least
well<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.110> he<00:02:23.319> looks<00:02:23.500> better<00:02:23.650> than<00:02:24.010> mask

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
well I think he looks better than mask

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.710 
well I think he looks better than mask
on<00:02:24.600> because<00:02:25.600> once<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:26.709> off<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.130> mask<00:02:27.720> as

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
on because once you take off the mask as

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.360 
on because once you take off the mask as

blade retracted just to cut on just to

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.780 
blade retracted just to cut on just to
save<00:06:16.770> on<00:06:16.950> money<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.280> guess<00:06:18.740> but<00:06:19.790> nevertheless

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
wondering about these figures I

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.219 
wondering about these figures I
certainly<00:06:57.449> think<00:06:57.659> they're<00:06:57.809> worth<00:06:58.020> it

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
certainly think they're worth it

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.189 
certainly think they're worth it
especially<00:06:58.830> if<00:06:59.309> you're<00:06:59.599> if<00:07:00.599> you're<00:07:00.629> if<00:07:01.020> you're

especially if you're if you're if you're

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.619 
especially if you're if you're if you're
still<00:07:01.349> trying<00:07:01.559> to<00:07:01.770> build<00:07:02.009> the<00:07:02.639> droid<00:07:02.879> I'll

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
still trying to build the droid I'll

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:05.839 
still trying to build the droid I'll
collect<00:07:04.020> some<00:07:04.199> pieces<00:07:04.409> of<00:07:04.529> the<00:07:04.589> droid<00:07:04.889> and<00:07:05.189> it

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.879 
collect some pieces of the droid and it
is<00:07:05.939> not<00:07:06.119> a<00:07:06.149> bad<00:07:06.389> droid<00:07:06.689> I<00:07:06.899> probably<00:07:07.319> do<00:07:07.529> another

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
is not a bad droid I probably do another
