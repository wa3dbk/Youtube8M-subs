00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
illnesses handling facility and we had

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.819 
illnesses handling facility and we had
to<00:03:05.400> replace<00:03:05.640> anything<00:03:11.750> one<00:03:12.750> wants<00:03:13.320> he<00:03:13.620> wants

her<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.780> portal<00:03:16.230> sometimes<00:03:23.690> it's<00:03:24.690> just

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
her on the portal sometimes it's just

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.150 
her on the portal sometimes it's just
tempering<00:03:25.470> damage

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.030 

so<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.330> example<00:03:33.050> for<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.170> color<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.740> one

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
so for example for the color this one

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.300 
so for example for the color this one
was<00:03:35.280> replaced<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.480> was<00:03:36.750> weren't<00:03:37.310> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
was replaced but this was weren't and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.930 
was replaced but this was weren't and
why<00:03:39.270> would<00:03:39.630> why<00:03:40.140> did<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.530> choose<00:03:40.740> this<00:03:41.040> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
why would why did you choose this I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.380 
why would why did you choose this I
think<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:43.110> it's<00:03:43.440> cultural<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:45.150> also

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
think it's it's cultural but it's also

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.240 
think it's it's cultural but it's also
cheaper<00:03:46.080> now<00:03:46.410> there<00:03:46.650> are<00:03:46.770> some<00:03:47.010> companies

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
cheaper now there are some companies

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.970 
cheaper now there are some companies
making<00:03:48.150> steel<00:03:49.280> walls<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.440> are<00:03:52.620> more
