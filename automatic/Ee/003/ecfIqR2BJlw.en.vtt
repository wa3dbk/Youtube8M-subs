this here's some practice paper in the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
this here's some practice paper in the
beginning<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:32.239> then<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> journal<00:00:33.660> pages

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 
look like this there's a spot to draw a
picture<00:00:36.110> then<00:00:37.110> there's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> spot<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.890> your

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
picture then there's a spot for your

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.479 
picture then there's a spot for your
early<00:00:38.719> graded<00:00:39.719> student<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.410> write<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.770> they

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
write a little entry there's space on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.410 
write a little entry there's space on
both<00:00:44.879> front<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:47.180> then<00:00:48.180> there's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
both front and back and then there's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
both front and back and then there's
paper<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.469> every<00:00:49.739> grade<00:00:49.980> level<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
paper in here for every grade level so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.720 
paper in here for every grade level so
that's<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> youngest<00:00:51.329> grade<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that's the youngest grade and then as it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
that's the youngest grade and then as it
gets<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.120> harder<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.199> lines<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.739> less

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
gets a little harder the lines get less

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.639 
gets a little harder the lines get less
wide<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.010> there's<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.550> dots<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> middle

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
wide and there's not dots in the middle

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
wide and there's not dots in the middle
so<00:01:01.649> they've<00:01:01.770> become<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:03.030> grade<00:01:03.239> level

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so they've become the right grade level

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
so they've become the right grade level
here<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.229> them<00:01:04.350> getting<00:01:04.530> smaller<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here you see them getting smaller and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
here you see them getting smaller and
smaller<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> goes<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> way

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
smaller so that it goes all the way

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.520 
smaller so that it goes all the way
through<00:01:07.560> fifth<00:01:08.159> grade<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
through fifth grade then from the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
through fifth grade then from the
journal<00:01:10.830> entry<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.340> student<00:01:11.760> writes
