I'm going to go ahead and just head over
here<00:01:30.540> throw<00:01:31.229> down<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> javelin<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:33.000> get

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
here throw down the javelin and just get

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
here throw down the javelin and just get
one<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.720> measure<00:01:33.900> while<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.560> waiting

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
one off a good measure while I'm waiting

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
one off a good measure while I'm waiting
the<00:01:35.280> other<00:01:35.400> thing<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:35.790> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> stay

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the other thing is I don't want to stay

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.580 
the other thing is I don't want to stay
within<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> building<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> see

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
within the a building because I can see

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.620 
within the a building because I can see
that<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> spawns<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.400> shifting<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:39.270> team<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that the spawns are shifting my team is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.120 
that the spawns are shifting my team is
spawning<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
spawning and be so I'm like I got to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
spawning and be so I'm like I got to
move<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:42.420> see<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> now<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> see

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
move on I can see that now you can see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230 
move on I can see that now you can see
that<00:01:43.229> they're<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> over<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> area<00:01:44.640> so

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that they're kind of over in the area so

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.050 
that they're kind of over in the area so
I<00:01:45.270> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> left<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> area<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> wouldn't

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
I kind of left that area so I wouldn't

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
I kind of left that area so I wouldn't
be<00:01:48.090> killed<00:01:48.329> inside<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> building<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
be killed inside the a building and you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.899 
be killed inside the a building and you
can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> they're<00:01:50.250> spawning<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.729> over

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
can see that they're spawning down over

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
can see that they're spawning down over
by<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.079> flips<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
by see right now and then it's flips and

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
by see right now and then it's flips and
then<00:01:53.280> they're<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.880> C<00:01:54.090> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
then they're kind of a and C so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
then they're kind of a and C so
definitely<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.500> glad<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> moved<00:01:56.189> over<00:01:56.399> into

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
definitely I'm glad I moved over into

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
definitely I'm glad I moved over into
the<00:01:56.670> words<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.180> building<00:01:57.299> something

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the words the be building something

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.240 
the words the be building something
that's<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.590> important<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.130> you're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that's really important when you're

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
that's really important when you're
actually<00:01:59.399> trying<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.180> decide<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> call

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
actually trying to decide where to call

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
actually trying to decide where to call
on<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.170> AC<00:02:01.350> 130<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.750> kind

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
on your AC 130 is you just have to kind

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.270 
on your AC 130 is you just have to kind
of<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.079> an<00:02:04.140> idea<00:02:04.259> where<00:02:04.710> their<00:02:04.829> spawns<00:02:05.100> are

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
of get an idea where their spawns are

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
of get an idea where their spawns are
now<00:02:05.430> sometimes<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> spawns<00:02:06.810> flip<00:02:07.079> because

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
now sometimes the spawns flip because

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
now sometimes the spawns flip because
your<00:02:07.469> teammates<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.090> dumb<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
your teammates can be really dumb and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
your teammates can be really dumb and
they'll<00:02:09.599> run<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.170> totally<00:02:10.860> flip<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they'll run in and totally flip the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
they'll run in and totally flip the
spawn<00:02:11.520> which<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> big<00:02:12.120> mess<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.989> but<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.650> lot

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
spawn which is a big mess but but a lot

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.990 
spawn which is a big mess but but a lot
of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.510 
of
x<00:02:14.170> oxy<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.290> happens<00:02:15.530> quite<00:02:15.710> often<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.190> if

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
x oxy that happens quite often but if

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.970 
x oxy that happens quite often but if
you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:16.940> spawn<00:02:17.870> near<00:02:18.050> your<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.350> team<00:02:18.590> then

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you can spawn near your you team then

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.530 
you can spawn near your you team then
even<00:02:19.490> better<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:19.880> that's<00:02:19.970> what<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.210> ended<00:02:20.450> up
