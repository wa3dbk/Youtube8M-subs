00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
played we have two of these valves that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.530 
played we have two of these valves that
are<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.160> exist<00:00:35.910> down<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.180> by<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
are actually exist down here by the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.350 
are actually exist down here by the
decontamination<00:00:37.020> pad<00:00:37.829> okay<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
decontamination pad okay so you just

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.670 
decontamination pad okay so you just
have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.899> around<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> map<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
have to go around the map there's a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 
have to go around the map there's a
there's<00:00:41.129> number<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.610> there's<00:00:42.149> another<00:00:42.390> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
there's number two there's another one

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
there's number two there's another one
down<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.700> fourth<00:00:45.030> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
down here and then there's a fourth so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.310 
down here and then there's a fourth so
you<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> find<00:00:45.750> them<00:00:45.840> they're<00:00:46.020> very

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you got to find them they're very

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680 
you got to find them they're very
difficult<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> find<00:00:47.430> especially<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.510> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
difficult to find especially when it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
difficult to find especially when it's
so<00:00:48.870> dark<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.250> turn

so dark I don't know if you can turn

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.860 
so dark I don't know if you can turn
your<00:00:50.550> brightness<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.329> game<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.690> never

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
your brightness up on your game we never

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
your brightness up on your game we never
tried<00:00:52.050> doing<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:53.070> did<00:00:53.250> manage<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
tried doing that but we did manage to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
tried doing that but we did manage to
find<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.660> four<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.440> going

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
