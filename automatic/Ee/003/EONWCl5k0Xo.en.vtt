they modeled everything on that guitar

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
they modeled everything on that guitar
basically<00:01:17.610> half<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.479> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
basically half of this one and just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
basically half of this one and just
changed<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> couple<00:01:19.500> things<00:01:19.830> i<00:01:20.130> scaled<00:01:20.939> back

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
changed a couple things i scaled back

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.490 
changed a couple things i scaled back
the<00:01:21.390> neck<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.780> normally<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> big

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the neck right here normally it's a big

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
the neck right here normally it's a big
square<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.790> shaved<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.360> down

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
square back here so we shaved this down

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.670 
square back here so we shaved this down
so<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.840> play<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.080> better<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.590> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
so you can play a little better a little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560 
so you can play a little better a little

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
I believe it is being released now I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.929 
I believe it is being released now I
think<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.189> debut<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:47.790> why<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
think this is the debut and that's why I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.670 
think this is the debut and that's why I
was<00:01:48.060> flown<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:49.649> be

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
was flown out I think so it should be

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
was flown out I think so it should be
out<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
call their local music stores and demand

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460
