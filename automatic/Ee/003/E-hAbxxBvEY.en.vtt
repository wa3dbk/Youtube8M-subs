00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.920 
pulse so they may not be aware okay I
know<00:03:37.040> an<00:03:37.220> electromagnetic<00:03:38.030> pulse<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.510> created

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
know an electromagnetic pulse is created

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.199 
know an electromagnetic pulse is created
by<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> nuclear<00:03:39.590> weapon<00:03:40.250> that's<00:03:40.640> detonated

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
by a nuclear weapon that's detonated

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.660 
by a nuclear weapon that's detonated
high<00:03:41.390> up<00:03:41.570> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.750> atmosphere<00:03:41.930> like<00:03:42.590> 250<00:03:43.459> miles

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
high up in the atmosphere like 250 miles

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.460 
high up in the atmosphere like 250 miles
up<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.180> they<00:03:44.300> don't<00:03:44.330> even<00:03:44.570> need<00:03:44.870> good

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
up so they don't even need good

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.500 
up so they don't even need good
targeting<00:03:46.100> data<00:03:46.250> they<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.000> need<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.269> lava

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
targeting data they just need to lava

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.320

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
sky and just I believe it was like 18

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.300 
sky and just I believe it was like 18
months<00:05:01.010> ago<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:02.690> was<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.900> huge<00:05:03.530> triangular

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
months ago there was a huge triangular

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.300 
months ago there was a huge triangular
shaped<00:05:04.790> sunspot<00:05:05.390> on<00:05:05.630> his<00:05:06.110> son<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.950> looked<00:05:07.220> just

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
shaped sunspot on his son it looked just

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.610 
shaped sunspot on his son it looked just
like<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.820> tetragrammaton<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.990> name<00:05:09.200> of<00:05:09.380> God

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
like the tetragrammaton the name of God

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.020 
like the tetragrammaton the name of God
and<00:05:10.390> I<00:05:11.390> consider<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.530> sign<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.010> sky<00:05:13.130> to

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
and I consider that a sign in the sky to

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.740 
and I consider that a sign in the sky to
in<00:05:14.420> a<00:05:14.480> so<00:05:15.320> away<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:15.860> comet<00:05:16.280> ison<00:05:16.750> good

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
in a so away and this comet ison good

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.420 
in a so away and this comet ison good
