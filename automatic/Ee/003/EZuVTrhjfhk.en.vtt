00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.370 

okay<00:00:01.439> so<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.920> other<00:00:01.949> spectral<00:00:02.790> map<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.380> more

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
okay so the other spectral map is more

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.000 
okay so the other spectral map is more
like<00:00:04.940> the<00:00:05.940> traditional<00:00:06.210> spectral<00:00:07.049> map<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
like the traditional spectral map and

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.419 
like the traditional spectral map and
that's<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:10.099> take<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:13.280> displacement<00:00:14.280> map

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that's in I take the displacement map

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.029 
that's in I take the displacement map
open<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.360> Photoshop<00:00:15.900> or<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> texture

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
open it up in Photoshop or a texture

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.700 
open it up in Photoshop or a texture
editor<00:00:17.220> editing<00:00:17.970> program<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.500> here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
editor editing program and go in here

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.019 
editor editing program and go in here
and<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.100> exposure<00:00:22.160> this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> do

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
and just exposure this is one way to do

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
and just exposure this is one way to do
it<00:00:24.180> okay<00:00:24.689> there's<00:00:24.930> probably<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> million<00:00:25.590> ways

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it okay there's probably a million ways

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.630 
it okay there's probably a million ways
to<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.289> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.320> hand<00:00:28.680> paint<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
to do this so you can hand paint it but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.209 
to do this so you can hand paint it but
really<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really what I do is just take the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.180 
really what I do is just take the
exposure<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:32.850> quite<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> bit<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:35.040> going

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
exposure down quite a bit and I'm going

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.900 
exposure down quite a bit and I'm going
to<00:00:35.219> leave<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.579> just<00:00:38.579> show

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to leave it about right here just show

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540 
to leave it about right here just show
you<00:00:38.969> how<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.329> works<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:40.950> here's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you how this works so you can see here's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.209 
you how this works so you can see here's
these<00:00:41.790> black<00:00:42.059> spots<00:00:42.860> here's<00:00:43.860> these<00:00:43.980> white

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
these black spots here's these white

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
these black spots here's these white
spots<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.910> you've<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.120> black<00:00:45.360> spots<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
spots and you've got black spots here so

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580 
spots and you've got black spots here so
I'm<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> save<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'm going to take and save this as and I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
I'm going to take and save this as and I
got<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:51.000> I'm

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
got a little thing in here now I'm

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
got a little thing in here now I'm
saving<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:52.850> as<00:00:53.899> Tiff's<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.550> i'm<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
saving these as Tiff's and i'm going to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:08.120 
saving these as Tiff's and i'm going to
call<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:56.940> spectral<00:00:57.629> to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.969 

and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.850> same<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.299> I've<00:01:09.659> already<00:01:10.350> put<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and the same time I've already put that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.870 
and the same time I've already put that
in<00:01:11.159> Maya<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.430> spectral

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
in Maya so it's right here your spectral

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
in Maya so it's right here your spectral
to<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> dragged<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.890> did

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to I dragged it in just like I did

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.789 
to I dragged it in just like I did
before<00:01:17.720> I'm<00:01:18.720> trying<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.560> much

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
before I'm trying to keep this as much

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.429 
before I'm trying to keep this as much
as<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.159> non<00:01:20.789> mile<00:01:21.299> lesson<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.810> possible<00:01:22.289> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
as a non mile lesson as possible and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
as a non mile lesson as possible and
more<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:24.060> zbrush<00:01:24.600> here's<00:01:24.899> how<00:01:25.049> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
more like here zbrush here's how you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.910 
more like here zbrush here's how you
produce<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.710> maps<00:01:27.350> because<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.770> use

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
produce all the maps because you can use

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.309 
produce all the maps because you can use
these<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> any<00:01:29.520> game<00:01:29.789> engine<00:01:30.240> too<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.960> it's

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
these in any game engine too so it's

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.969 
these in any game engine too so it's
like<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.810> i'm<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.869> using<00:01:34.289> my<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> show

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
like it's not i'm just using my to show

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
like it's not i'm just using my to show
you<00:01:35.039> what<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.270> probably

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you what they look like i could probably

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
you what they look like i could probably
use<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.200> game<00:01:37.890> engine<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.369> show<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.759> they

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
use a game engine to show you what they

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.389 
use a game engine to show you what they
look<00:01:38.880> like<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.830> just<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.220> faster

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
look like to just a little bit faster

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:48.609 
look like to just a little bit faster
here<00:01:45.740> alright<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.340> let's<00:01:47.789> look<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.179> map

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
here alright so let's look at this map

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
here alright so let's look at this map
and<00:01:49.619> here's<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:52.640> spectral<00:01:53.640> color<00:01:53.849> and<00:01:54.090> what

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and here's the spectral color and what

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.710 
and here's the spectral color and what
I've<00:01:55.140> done<00:01:55.289> is<00:01:55.530> already<00:01:56.209> clicked<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:57.330> dragged

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
I've done is already clicked and dragged

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.580 
I've done is already clicked and dragged
this<00:01:58.110> over<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.950> okay<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.409> what

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
this over to here okay and this is what

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
this over to here okay and this is what
I<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.709> not<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> special<00:02:02.759> effect<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.360> get

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
I get not the special effect I get

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.359 
I get not the special effect I get
something<00:02:04.289> else<00:02:04.439> now<00:02:06.409> let<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.560> take<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.130> off

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
something else now let me take this off

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
something else now let me take this off
for<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> second<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.569> show<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.049> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
for a second kind of show you what it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.270 
for a second kind of show you what it
looks<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.560> without<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.980> break

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
looks like without it it's break

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.690 
looks like without it it's break
connection<00:02:15.799> okay<00:02:16.799> as<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.310> right<00:02:17.430> now

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
connection okay as you can see right now

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.220 
connection okay as you can see right now
it's<00:02:18.450> very<00:02:18.840> shiny<00:02:19.200> everywhere<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:21.230> that's

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
it's very shiny everywhere and that's

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.819 
it's very shiny everywhere and that's
not<00:02:22.440> how<00:02:23.690> things<00:02:24.690> look<00:02:25.079> in<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> real<00:02:25.590> world

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
not how things look in the real world

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.330 
not how things look in the real world
okay<00:02:26.480> not<00:02:27.480> skulls<00:02:27.930> anyway<00:02:28.410> skulls<00:02:28.889> are<00:02:29.130> very

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
okay not skulls anyway skulls are very

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.039 
okay not skulls anyway skulls are very
diffused<00:02:30.269> creatures<00:02:30.870> unless<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:32.000> are

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
diffused creatures unless they are

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.650 
diffused creatures unless they are
published<00:02:34.049> in<00:02:34.590> some<00:02:34.829> way<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.090> light<00:02:36.269> goes

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
published in some way so the light goes

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.379 
published in some way so the light goes
on<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.139> them<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.769> sucks<00:02:38.639> the<00:02:38.790> light<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
on to them and it sucks the light in it

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.400 
on to them and it sucks the light in it
doesn't<00:02:39.690> reflect<00:02:39.989> any<00:02:40.290> light<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.109> that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
doesn't reflect any light so in that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.379 
doesn't reflect any light so in that
case<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.739> what<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.280> want<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.329> to

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
case we what we want to do is is to

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.410 
case we what we want to do is is to
control<00:02:46.319> light<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.579> control<00:02:47.940> light<00:02:48.180> we

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
control light and to control light we

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.830 
control light and to control light we
use<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:50.160> mapping<00:02:50.609> technology<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.359> spectral

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
use the mapping technology of spectral

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.520 
use the mapping technology of spectral
so<00:02:55.459> now<00:02:56.459> I've<00:02:56.670> dim<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.060> quite<00:02:57.359> down<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.319> this

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
so now I've dim that quite down but this

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.789 
so now I've dim that quite down but this
is<00:02:58.739> more<00:02:58.980> realistic<00:03:03.139> now<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.170> always<00:03:04.590> encourage

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
is more realistic now I always encourage

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.490 
is more realistic now I always encourage
students<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.609> mess<00:03:06.239> around<00:03:06.389> with<00:03:06.660> these<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
students to mess around with these you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.940 
students to mess around with these you
know<00:03:07.620> don't<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.849> be<00:03:09.239> afraid<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.780> jump<00:03:10.739> in

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
know don't don't be afraid to jump in

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.979 
know don't don't be afraid to jump in
here<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.519> play<00:03:11.790> around<00:03:12.090> with<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.870> know

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
here and play around with you know

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.490 
here and play around with you know
what's<00:03:13.170> reflective<00:03:13.709> color<00:03:14.120> but<00:03:15.229> please<00:03:16.229> note

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
what's reflective color but please note

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.110 
what's reflective color but please note
that<00:03:16.530> there's<00:03:16.949> only<00:03:17.070> certain<00:03:17.400> things<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.090> a

that there's only certain things that a

but<00:03:31.440> not<00:03:32.440> every<00:03:32.770> channel<00:03:33.070> in<00:03:33.280> here<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.670> covered

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
but not every channel in here is covered

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.690 
but not every channel in here is covered
under<00:03:34.240> game<00:03:34.660> engines<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.740> reflective<00:03:36.400> color

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
under game engines like reflective color

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.470 
under game engines like reflective color
I<00:03:37.170> don't<00:03:38.170> think<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:38.890> know<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.160> one<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.790> has

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
I don't think I know of one that has

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.810 
I don't think I know of one that has
reflective<00:03:41.020> color<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:47.530> translucent<00:03:48.340> focus

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
reflective color like translucent focus

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.810 
reflective color like translucent focus
okay<00:03:49.390> again<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.350> I'll<00:03:50.530> know<00:03:50.770> of<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.220> engine

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
okay again and I'll know of a engine

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.060 
okay again and I'll know of a engine
that<00:03:51.970> has<00:03:52.150> translucent<00:03:52.840> focus<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.800> there's<00:03:53.980> a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that has translucent focus so there's a

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.040 
that has translucent focus so there's a
few<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.459> these<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.640> here<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.300> are<00:03:55.510> not

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
few of these in here that are not

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.320 
few of these in here that are not
covered<00:03:56.320> under<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.770> standard<00:03:57.130> engine<00:03:57.330> but

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
covered under the standard engine but

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.270 
covered under the standard engine but
that<00:03:59.020> doesn't<00:03:59.140> mean<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.530> can't<00:03:59.770> play<00:04:00.010> around

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
that doesn't mean you can't play around

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.699 
that doesn't mean you can't play around
I<00:04:00.550> mean<00:04:00.820> really<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.050> stay<00:04:02.260> around<00:04:02.500> in

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
I mean really you can stay around in

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.710 
I mean really you can stay around in
Maya<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.459> play<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.030> reflective<00:04:04.480> color

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
Maya and play with the reflective color

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.210 
Maya and play with the reflective color
and<00:04:04.959> say<00:04:05.110> oh<00:04:05.140> okay<00:04:05.709> well<00:04:05.920> I'm<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.160> throw

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
and say oh okay well I'm going to throw

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.390 
and say oh okay well I'm going to throw
this<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.820> here<00:04:07.000> as<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.600> reflective<00:04:08.200> color<00:04:08.440> then

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
this on here as a reflective color then

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.770 
this on here as a reflective color then
I<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.980> very<00:04:11.980> diffused<00:04:12.640> spectral<00:04:13.330> light<00:04:13.540> or

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
I have a very diffused spectral light or

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.750 
I have a very diffused spectral light or
you<00:04:14.650> know<00:04:14.770> where<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.070> doesn't<00:04:15.340> have<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.580> whole

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
you know where it doesn't have a whole

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.000 
you know where it doesn't have a whole
lot<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.940> highlights<00:04:16.330> on<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.680> where

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
lot of highlights on it and then where

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.520 
lot of highlights on it and then where
it<00:04:18.100> does<00:04:18.280> actually<00:04:19.030> reflect<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:20.049> have<00:04:20.500> a

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
it does actually reflect I have a

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.510 
it does actually reflect I have a
special<00:04:20.829> effect<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.579> on<00:04:21.850> so<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:24.010> know<00:04:24.130> it's

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
special effect going on so you know it's

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.560 
special effect going on so you know it's
it's<00:04:24.790> fun<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.419> play<00:04:25.600> around<00:04:25.720> as<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.080> new<00:04:26.290> student

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
it's fun to play around as a new student

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.200 
it's fun to play around as a new student
heck<00:04:28.570> that's<00:04:28.750> half<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.850> thing<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.060> I've

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
heck that's half the thing that I've

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.230 
heck that's half the thing that I've
learned<00:04:31.480> from<00:04:32.320> this<00:04:32.500> stuff<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.010> just<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:34.120> know

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
learned from this stuff is just you know

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.150 
learned from this stuff is just you know
you<00:04:34.300> can<00:04:34.570> there<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.230> no<00:04:35.440> right<00:04:35.770> or<00:04:35.800> wrong

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
you can there is no right or wrong

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.680 
you can there is no right or wrong
answer<00:04:36.220> two<00:04:36.760> things<00:04:37.030> there's<00:04:37.419> just

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
answer two things there's just

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.030 
answer two things there's just
unexplored<00:04:38.320> territory

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.439 

and<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.699> course<00:04:46.730> it's<00:04:47.120> going<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.330> get<00:04:47.389> really

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
and of course it's going to get really

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.200 
and of course it's going to get really
dog<00:04:48.080> slow<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:48.710> try<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.220> whole<00:04:49.639> bunch<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.090> these

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
dog slow if I try a whole bunch of these

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.870 
dog slow if I try a whole bunch of these
on<00:04:50.480> different<00:04:50.810> channels<00:04:51.430> pretty<00:04:52.430> soon<00:04:52.639> enough

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
on different channels pretty soon enough

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.640 
on different channels pretty soon enough
you<00:04:53.300> know<00:04:53.419> i'll<00:04:53.570> show<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.810> how<00:04:53.900> to<00:04:54.050> package<00:04:54.320> up

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
you know i'll show you how to package up
