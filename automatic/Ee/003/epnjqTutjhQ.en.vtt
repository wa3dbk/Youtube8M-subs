00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.010
 I now stand before the position of Mad Max 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.599
 a game that I am not really looking at 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.130
 had what i had something like well we 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.720
 know you make nothing of course 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.550
 three films with mel gibson 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.539
 yes i already have apocalyptic desert 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.349
 games played as rich moore spring 1 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.640
 and 2 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.890
 so i kind of like what a game can do 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.930
 add os mac salt but I have the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.809
 given a presentation and I am still here 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.089
 quite enthusiastic it is a free 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.080
 so roaming action game that entire desert 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.710
 des arts 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.299
 happening can go wherever you want 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.070
 but madmax really needs to show him 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.720
 the king is of the desert and that he 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.030
 so really has a car that makes you proud 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.400
 Be on and the goal is that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.830
 to search for in that desert from 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.809
 enemies where you can steal parts 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.570
 bullets all gasoline stuff that whole 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.070
 very rare in that world and how 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.879
 you can handle that yourself 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.379
 know 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.150
 so you can for example just with the all 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.130
 chance of reading entering such a kind and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.439
 everyone for popping around but you can 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.000
 also with an enter hook , for example 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.530
 make a tower flicker down 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.759
 so put the cart in it at a cheap 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.159
 way dies 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.869
 You can go it allows anyone and sneek 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.670
 is attacking backs 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.200
 you can go to him after all arkema 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.090
 matting for very good 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.670
 finishing moves we to do when someone they 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.799
 arm breaks then you also have racing 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.579
 if your car expanded into a big one 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.380
 sample 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.149
 named you can open it you can yourself 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.520
 choose willeke fast car out of it 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.740
 I want a defensive few days off 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.329
 deal with a battering ram and then you have 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.700
 real moments that you go through that desert 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.229
 and that there is bandit next to them 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.939
 come and you can choose yourself 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.439
 I go in slow motion 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.270
 that driver popping through his head 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.710
 I just take him off the road on the floor 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.569
 rambo cells the graphics are too 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.069
 the sand looks great 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.259
 realistic it sounds very funny 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.030
 sand looks realistic 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.429
 but looks into the distance on the horizon 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.679
 The decorates blow up dust and after it looks 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.630
 looks really beautiful and it is one 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.340
 desert setting but she still sits 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.099
 a lot of colors in a lot of each 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.899
 liveliness surely that can be good 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.420
 say more on it actually i went there 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.940
 with a sense of yes why should one 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.079
 game was like playing mac's but me 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.079
