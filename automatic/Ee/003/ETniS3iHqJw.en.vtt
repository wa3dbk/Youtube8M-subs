00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
here is the wax and then here's the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
called the small angled brush and then I

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:03.830

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.790

they're kind of bigger than I expected I

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.970 
they're kind of bigger than I expected I
probably<00:05:09.430> would<00:05:10.390> not<00:05:10.540> use<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:11.020> for<00:05:11.770> my

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980

probably would not use this for my
crease<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.580> would<00:05:12.850> probably<00:05:13.540> use<00:05:13.570> this<00:05:14.110> just

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
crease I would probably use this just

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.920 
crease I would probably use this just
for<00:05:14.620> blending<00:05:15.100> or<00:05:16.110> contouring<00:05:17.110> my<00:05:17.380> cheeks<00:05:18.930> so
