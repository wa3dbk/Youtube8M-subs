00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 to 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.910
 you have to have that new behavior and 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.389
 this time here we are in a new 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.630
 seed for minecraft 360 and well let's go 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.640
 to start there are parents see just the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.860
 image of the player that I have but rain 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.480
 our life is not always so good 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:30.430
 this seed is called be good by vigo or 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.840
 something like that, so the bng is worth it 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.129
 as it is written as well as I am serving 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.079
 continuation has been to put you 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.550
 so that it is done correctly and not 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.449
 have no error and they come out 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.499
 perfectly the seed and well 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.190
 this gentleman the truth that is very father 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:48.399
 very nice the truth that I'm not going to 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.140
 lie they would say to direct us 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.539
 at the moment the spoiler but the truth that 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.579
 the seed is very good very interesting 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.690
 they are the seeds that I like and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.309
 Well, here I bring them because 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.350
 one more seed was needed in the channel 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 and well, good friend, this advice 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.670
 I give because to ask for sailors today 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.900
 here we go measure good to accompany this 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.580
 click rum off in checks of no 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 more in the back as it looks like 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.899
 if it were a castle that chulada true 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.080
 but hey it's not a castle it's 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.940
 simply earth gravel sand everything 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.369
 that is necessary to make a mountain 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.740
 Well, all that and well, we're going to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.270
 travel for what the map would be like 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.390
 can see below are many 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.390
 many many the mountains that are here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.030
 this tree in large quantities 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.069
 water is there is land to give to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.319
 throw up so then you have to go 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.819
 seeing what they like as they can see 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.649
 next in the part on the right 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.619
 and in the middle part and in the part 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.149
 On the left there are waterfalls two of 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.920
 water and one of lava the truth looks very 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.750
 father that is great when there are of those 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.970
 because they are natural you do not have them 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.470
 do you can do do not know there 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.240
 different constructions that you can 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.340
 do in the part there is like a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.659
 obelisk I think if they call the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.350
 pointed part that are in the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.689
 mountain then there is this one 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.299
 if in that part of coal imagine 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.920
 you that so much or that so many minerals 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.989
 will be in everything that would be the subject 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 word that is very impressive to see the 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.709
 amount of minerals that will have 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.319
 this map because then I know it's going to 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.450
 have a lot is not everywhere 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.430
 there is coal everywhere there are stones 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.660
 everywhere there are gravel sand lands 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.300
 clay this tree is for more or for 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.459

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.520
