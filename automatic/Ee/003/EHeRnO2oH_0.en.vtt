00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 is much attention experiment the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
 next red traffic light experiment 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.690
 that means that you can not repeat 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 in case of water but that inside the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 pencil we have a coal mine like 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 We have taken this mine that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.660
 found inside the pencil and the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 we will use to do the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 experiment what we are going to do is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 connect the coal mine to two 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 crocodiles two cables that go to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680
 transmit electric current through 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.610
 from her we are going to submerge her inside 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.160
 this container that has water 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.440
 and once it's in we're going to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 close the electric circuit by putting 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 current of this 12-volt battery 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.100
 and look what happens 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.720
 in principle it would seem that it is not 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.400
 nothing is happening but something is happening 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.290
 very important we are going to put our 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.620
 lenses so you can see it 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.890
 we are going to remove the graphite from the water and 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.890
 look 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.440
 you want to know what happened what 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.960
 happened is that the electric current 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.240
 I travel through the graphite and it 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.600
 heated offering resistance and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.730
 offer resistance raised its temperature 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 the gas that we have just seen in reality 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.260
 it is water that has evaporated has passed 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 there was a liquid in a gaseous state 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.460
 this electrical resistance that we have 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.900
 created is not different from the resistance 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.940
 electrical that is inside the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.350
 earth warms me the water or the one that 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
 find inside the toaster and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.880
 heat our food both use 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440
 electric current in the same way 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.690
 that which is within the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.550
 focuses and I'll show you with another 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 graphite mine this time much more 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.680
 We are going to connect it to the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.200
 crocodiles like we did a second ago 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.400
 and not only will we produce with the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.240
 heat but we're going to produce light 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.240
 pay a lot of attention 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.209
 tourism 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.209
 [Music] 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.709
 this is the same principle with which 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.690
 a focus works like this we have created 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.940
 our own focus with resistance 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.430
 of a graphite mine 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.890
 now we have another example of reaction 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.900
 electrochemistry for you we will use 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.360
 the electricity to divide the water into 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.570
 hydrogen and oxygen as you know 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.580
 experience the water is h2o that 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.100
 It means that each water molecule is 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.860
 composed of two hydrogen atoms and 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.290
 an oxygen atom 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.240
 these two gases are very important the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.220
 hydrogen for example serves as 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.900
 fuel for the rockets and that's 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.000
 exactly what we are going to do in the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.040
 next experiment like this is for 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.290
 produce rocket fuel that is 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.700
 hydrogen let's separate it from its 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.310
 molecule using the following 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 first items a tray full of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.239
 water to which we have salt 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.340
 The next thing we're going to need is 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.950
 two graphite rods inside 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.780
 plastic tubes each one of them will be 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.500
 the electrical current terminal that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 will cause the reaction some wires a 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.209
 9 volt battery and finally ones 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.950
 matches that we will use to 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 check that what we have produced is 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.269
 in truth hydrogen and that is flammable 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.890
 The first thing we are going to do is submerge 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.290
 the two graphite rods in the water 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.760
 with salt, trying not to leave any 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.760
 bubble of air inside 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.750
 a two and we're going to place them in the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.550
 edge 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.440
 The next thing we're going to do is 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.280
 connect them with these crocodiles 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.280
 electric 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.950
 here 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.020
 and the other here and that's it and now we're going to 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.490
 take the ends of the gogo of the thread and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.730
 we are going to connect them to the battery 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.670
 [Music] 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.590
 you want to know what it is that is 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.320
 happening at this time with the water 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.139
 when connecting the current the molecule of 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.449
 water is divided into the gas atoms that 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.949
 they form it in one of the rods which 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.860
 is connected to the negative pole 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.449
 hydrogen is formed in the other rod 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.090
 which is connected to the positive pole is 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.490
 they form oxygen bubbles as you see each 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.040
 there is more gas inside the tubes and 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.710
 they are displacing the water like this thanks to the 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.889
 electrolysis we have separated the water in 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.690
 the two gases that make it up as 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.550
 riccardo explained the tube that is 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.130
 connected to the negative cable has been 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.380
 filled with hydrogen and now we're going to 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.380
 demonstrate what we are going to do is 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.840
 disconnect the crocodile tube and 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.970
 Riccardo is going to bring him a match 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.350
 on look what happens we're going to 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.350
 hear a little sound 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.280
 preparations 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.310
 [Music] 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.680
 they saw what happened this happens because the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.810
 hydrogen is a flammable gas that's why 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.690
 It is used in large quantities to 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.980
 make rockets take off like this is and 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.560
 if you are curious to know 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.940
 exactly how hydrogen is made 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.940
 pay attention to what yes 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.940
 the hydrogen atom has a single 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.310
 proton and a single electron the proton is 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.290
 in the center nucleus of the atom and the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.260
 electron is spinning in a cloud 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.020
 around this the proton has charge 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:46.689
 positive and the electron has charge 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.360
 negative as they have opposite charges be 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:52.419
 if the proton was the size of a 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.610
 the electron would be spinning 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.059
 in an orbit the size of a stadium 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.509
 of soccer the hydrogen atom is the 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:03.069
 simplest of nature now that 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.489
 we have learned a little more about 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.529
 the atoms what we are going to do now is 

00:06:05.489 --> 00:06:10.719
 a chemical reaction to produce 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:15.509
 electric current and for that 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:17.860
 we need nothing more and nothing less than 2 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.809
 that's not only we're going to use the 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.610
 dads if we are not going to use a small 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:24.369
 clock that will turn on when 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.689
 reaction starts to happen and for that 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:30.769
 We are going to use 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:33.110
 metal rods one zinc and one 

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:35.479
 of collection the first thing we are going to do is 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.049
 insert the copper rod into one of 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.049
 potatoes 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.170
 so it varies and is connected by a 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.020
 cable to the positive end of the watch 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.540
 Now let's insert another rod in 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.910
 this case a zinc in that same pope 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.000
 notice that there is one copper and one 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.760
 zinc in the first potato is this unit 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.129
 by a wire to another copper rod in 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.259
 the second pope 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.929
 and we will finish connecting the rod 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.939
 of zinc that is tied to the cable 

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:08.769
 negative of the clock at the moment when 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.379
 insert it, the 

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.699
 electrochemical reaction and soon 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.389
 we can see how the clock works 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.389
 pay a lot of attention 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.970
 the circuit has been closed and our 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.130
 clock is operating what has happened 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.440
 that the metal rods along with the 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.479
 potatoes created a battery that generates 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.639
 electric current generates electricity 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:33.389
 until the investigate until the clock 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.610
 can work like this is look at this 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.620
 battery works in the same way that 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.840
 the battery of a car or the battery you use 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.720
 for some toy every potato is a 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.840
 electrochemical cell and the potato is the 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.750
 means by which the copper atoms and 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.270
 the zinc react they lose electrons and 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.970
 ions are moving from metal to metal 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:57.539
 a stream of metal electrons in 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.880
 metal forms electric current all 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:01.380
 the batteries work in the same way 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.000
 which you have at your disposal about 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.949
 all the batteries of the toys in their 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.870
 interior also have metals like 

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:08.520
 these who are reacting and by the 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.760
 reaction between them occurs 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:13.720
 electric current 

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.720
 it's like this
