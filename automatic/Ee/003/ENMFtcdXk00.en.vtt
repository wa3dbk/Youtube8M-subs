this<00:00:11.320> technology<00:00:12.220> I<00:00:12.460> believe<00:00:12.970> will<00:00:13.269> transform

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
this technology I believe will transform

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.390 
this technology I believe will transform
anesthesia<00:00:15.250> this<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:16.119> a<00:00:16.150> paradigm<00:00:16.660> shift<00:00:16.689> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
anesthesia this is a paradigm shift it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.370 
anesthesia this is a paradigm shift it
leverages<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.730> most<00:00:19.449> highly<00:00:19.930> trained

individual in anesthesia leverages them

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.700 
individual in anesthesia leverages them
so<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.680> they<00:00:24.160> can<00:00:24.369> provide<00:00:24.520> services<00:00:25.359> in

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
so that they can provide services in

anesthesia<00:00:46.630> what<00:00:47.290> was<00:00:47.469> developed<00:00:47.980> around

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
anesthesia what was developed around

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.389 
anesthesia what was developed around
web-based<00:00:49.180> technology<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.950> virtually

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
web-based technology and so it virtually

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.680 
web-based technology and so it virtually
opens<00:00:52.090> up<00:00:52.379> every<00:00:53.379> hospital<00:00:53.950> every<00:00:54.690> clinic

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
opens up every hospital every clinic

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.440 
opens up every hospital every clinic
every<00:00:56.140> ASC<00:00:56.829> across<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.430> country<00:00:57.850> it<00:00:58.000> really

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
every ASC across the country it really

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.979 
every ASC across the country it really
makes<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.079> very<00:00:59.489> scalable<00:01:00.489> product<00:01:01.030> one

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
makes it a very scalable product one

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.639 
makes it a very scalable product one
that<00:01:02.379> is<00:01:02.559> easily<00:01:02.940> installed<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:05.110> any<00:01:05.439> location

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.779 
camera in the operating room and look at
the<00:01:11.139> anesthesia<00:01:11.560> machine<00:01:12.069> or<00:01:12.279> look<00:01:12.579> at<00:01:12.700> the

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
the anesthesia machine or look at the

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.370 
the anesthesia machine or look at the
patient<00:01:13.179> and<00:01:13.359> see<00:01:13.539> what<00:01:13.719> they're<00:01:13.869> doing<00:01:14.109> once

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
patient and see what they're doing once

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.230 
patient and see what they're doing once
again<00:01:14.529> we<00:01:14.799> give<00:01:14.979> an<00:01:15.130> anesthesiologist<00:01:16.090> the

find<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.920> day

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
find a day

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.979 
find a day
that<00:02:12.860> most<00:02:13.250> rural<00:02:13.519> hospitals<00:02:14.300> are<00:02:14.420> struggling

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
that most rural hospitals are struggling

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.380 
that most rural hospitals are struggling
to<00:02:15.319> keep<00:02:15.500> their<00:02:15.560> doors<00:02:15.890> open<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.940> if<00:02:17.090> they<00:02:17.209> can

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to keep their doors open so if they can

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.869 
to keep their doors open so if they can
keep<00:02:17.599> four<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.140> five<00:02:18.349> hundred<00:02:18.879> additional

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
keep four to five hundred additional

keep four to five hundred additional
surgery<00:02:20.690> cases<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.230> their<00:02:22.010> community<00:02:22.519> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
surgery cases in their community and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.000 
surgery cases in their community and
perform<00:02:23.030> those<00:02:23.239> cases<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.290> be<00:02:24.379> paid<00:02:24.620> for<00:02:24.890> them

perform those cases and be paid for them

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.070 
perform those cases and be paid for them
it<00:02:25.310> may<00:02:25.519> be<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.730> difference<00:02:26.269> between<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.720> small

thereby<00:03:08.870> producing<00:03:09.170> costs<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:10.220> removes<00:03:10.700> the

thereby producing costs it removes the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.009 
thereby producing costs it removes the

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
doctor to participate in and so it

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.250 
doctor to participate in and so it
eliminates<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.980> obstruction<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:21.079> also

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
eliminates that obstruction and it also

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.509 
eliminates that obstruction and it also
creates<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.250> whole<00:03:22.840> United<00:03:23.840> States

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
creates the whole United States

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.760 
creates the whole United States
potentially<00:03:25.519> as<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.880> no<00:03:26.269> are<00:03:26.510> without<00:03:27.079> walls
