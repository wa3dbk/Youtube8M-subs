like my eyes are looking at the comic

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.030 
like my eyes are looking at the comic
and<00:01:04.479> they<00:01:04.629> go<00:01:04.780> straight<00:01:05.229> down<00:01:05.259> to<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.799> lower

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
and they go straight down to the lower

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.370 
and they go straight down to the lower
right-hand<00:01:06.880> side<00:01:07.360> because<00:01:07.720> there's<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.990> giant

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
right-hand side because there's a giant

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.440
