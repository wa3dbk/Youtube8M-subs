the first semi-final and we gained
momentum<00:02:26.900> off<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.530> back<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:29.390> think

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
momentum off the back of that so I think

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
momentum off the back of that so I think
we<00:02:30.379> got<00:02:30.620> momentum<00:02:31.190> at<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.549> right<00:02:31.730> time<00:02:32.000> you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
we got momentum at the right time you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.420 
we got momentum at the right time you
know<00:02:32.720> we'll<00:02:33.319> play<00:02:33.500> some<00:02:33.560> good<00:02:33.890> football<00:02:34.129> at

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
know we'll play some good football at

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.790 
know we'll play some good football at
the<00:02:34.549> right<00:02:34.700> time<00:02:35.000> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the right time and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.680 
the right time and
