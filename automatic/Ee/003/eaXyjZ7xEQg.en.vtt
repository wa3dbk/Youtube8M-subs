probably<00:01:22.740> most<00:01:22.979> important<00:01:23.640> thing<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
probably most important thing is that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
probably most important thing is that
yeah<00:01:24.360> death<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> trope<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
yeah death is kind of a trope it's a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
yeah death is kind of a trope it's a
little<00:01:26.490> bit<00:01:26.580> overused<00:01:26.960> people<00:01:27.960> try<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> like

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
little bit overused people try to like

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
little bit overused people try to like
wedge<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:28.950> their<00:01:29.070> stories<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> give<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
wedge it into their stories to give it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.630 
wedge it into their stories to give it
depth<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.840> useful<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.460> depth

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
depth it's not useful for that the depth

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
depth it's not useful for that the depth
has<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.329> first<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.229> death

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
has to be there first and then death

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
has to be there first and then death
makes<00:01:35.070> an<00:01:35.250> interesting<00:01:35.640> depth<00:01:35.850> depth<00:01:36.150> but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
makes an interesting depth depth but

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
makes an interesting depth depth but
then<00:01:37.079> why<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.560> overused<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.820> death

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
then why is a so overused because death

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
then why is a so overused because death
when<00:01:39.479> used<00:01:39.659> properly<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.520> incredibly

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
when used properly is incredibly

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
when used properly is incredibly
emotional<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.689> interesting<00:01:43.110> thing<00:01:43.229> about

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
emotional the interesting thing about

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.690 
emotional the interesting thing about
death<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> doesn't<00:01:44.070> always<00:01:44.340> suit

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
death is that it doesn't always suit
