was<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.150> week<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> meat<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
was a week out from my the meat where I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.320 
was a week out from my the meat where I
pulled<00:01:12.180> 750<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> pulled<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> 700<00:01:14.189> triple<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
pulled 750 I pulled a 700 triple but the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
pulled 750 I pulled a 700 triple but the
weight<00:01:15.509> fell<00:01:15.750> off<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.200> half<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:17.040> through<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
weight fell off a half way through the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
weight fell off a half way through the
3rd<00:01:17.580> rep<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> didn't<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
3rd rep so I didn't actually get that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.370 
3rd rep so I didn't actually get that
and<00:01:20.479> leading<00:01:21.479> into<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.840> had<00:01:22.020> never<00:01:22.170> done

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and leading into that I had never done

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.850 
and leading into that I had never done
anything<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.770> crazy<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.360> idea<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
anything this crazy so the idea was to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
anything this crazy so the idea was to
hit<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.759> 12<00:01:27.750> reps<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.350> ninety<00:01:28.619> percent

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
hit all 12 reps at this ninety percent

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.910 
hit all 12 reps at this ninety percent
and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.369> drop<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.780> eighty<00:01:31.110> percent<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and then drop down to eighty percent and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
and then drop down to eighty percent and
do<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:33.180> 12<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.990> reps<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
do a 12 more reps and I'm not going to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.980 
do a 12 more reps and I'm not going to
lie<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:37.439> most<00:01:37.619> mentally<00:01:38.100> taxing

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
lie this was the most mentally taxing

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.499 
lie this was the most mentally taxing
group<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.259> four<00:01:40.619> sets<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> I've<00:01:41.220> ever<00:01:41.360> had<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
get through on a deadlift because I just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.280 
get through on a deadlift because I just
so<00:01:47.670> tired<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> end<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.110> so

multiple top sets anymore
these<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.500> ended<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.770> pretty<00:01:55.980> good<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.870> I

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
these all ended up pretty good so I

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.620

that it would be tough to duplicate it
and<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:17.490> really<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> waited<00:02:18.480> until<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.630 
and it really was so I waited until the
very<00:02:19.110> last<00:02:19.200> step<00:02:19.590> before<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.250> any<00:02:20.430> music

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
very last step before I put on any music

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.180 
very last step before I put on any music
and<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.770> ended<00:02:23.100> up<00:02:23.130> being

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and I think that ended up being

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.890 
and I think that ended up being
beneficial<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:24.030> almost<00:02:24.300> didn't<00:02:24.570> go<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
beneficial I almost didn't go for the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.420 
beneficial I almost didn't go for the
fourth<00:02:25.200> threat<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.710> for<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> fourth<00:02:26.220> set

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
fourth threat or for the fourth set

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.449 
fourth threat or for the fourth set
because<00:02:26.780> my<00:02:27.780> lumbars<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.500> my<00:02:28.590> spinal

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
because my lumbars and my spinal

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.220 
because my lumbars and my spinal
erectors<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:30.030> getting<00:02:30.270> pretty<00:02:30.390> torched<00:02:30.900> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
erectors were getting pretty torched and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780 
erectors were getting pretty torched and
my<00:02:31.500> hands<00:02:31.920> were<00:02:31.980> getting<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> little<00:02:32.370> bit<00:02:32.580> torn

my hands were getting a little bit torn

my hands were getting a little bit torn
up<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.600> thing<00:02:34.530> that's<00:02:34.709> different

lot of focus attention and effort on
that<00:05:13.060> recovery<00:05:13.570> process<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.620> was<00:05:14.800> really

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
I went on to the benching and you saw

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.050 
I went on to the benching and you saw
right<00:05:30.070> there<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:30.280> hit<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.520> couple<00:05:30.700> of<00:05:30.880> heavy

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
right there I hit a couple of heavy

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.700 
right there I hit a couple of heavy
weights<00:05:31.300> with<00:05:31.480> that<00:05:31.630> sling<00:05:31.870> shy<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.410> was<00:05:32.500> the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
weights with that sling shy that was the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.260 
weights with that sling shy that was the
second<00:05:33.220> time<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.520> I've<00:05:33.580> used<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.150> this

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
second time that I've used that in this

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.330 
second time that I've used that in this
training<00:05:34.570> block<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.560> first<00:05:35.800> time<00:05:36.040> it<00:05:36.190> was<00:05:36.250> a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
training block the first time it was a

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.650 
training block the first time it was a
little<00:05:36.490> ridiculous<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:37.150> 315<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:37.990> so<00:05:38.580> I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
little ridiculous for 315 and so I

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.600 
little ridiculous for 315 and so I
worked<00:05:40.660> up<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:40.990> 360<00:05:41.650> single<00:05:41.979> without<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.460> and

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
worked up to a 360 single without it and

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.130 
worked up to a 360 single without it and
then<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.820> said<00:05:43.030> okay<00:05:43.240> I'll<00:05:43.330> put<00:05:43.510> this<00:05:43.630> on<00:05:43.840> and

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.140 
then I said okay I'll put this on and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.510 
then I said okay I'll put this on and
gets

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
gets

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.460 
gets
overload<00:05:45.000> so<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.270> can<00:05:45.599> get<00:05:45.780> used<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.199> having

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
overload so I can get used to having

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.040 
overload so I can get used to having
some<00:05:46.770> heavier<00:05:47.069> weights<00:05:47.280> in<00:05:47.460> my<00:05:47.550> hands<00:05:47.970> so<00:05:48.150> I'm

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
some heavier weights in my hands so I'm

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.869 
some heavier weights in my hands so I'm
not<00:05:49.289> as<00:05:49.560> shocked<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.129> I<00:05:50.190> get<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.520> meat<00:05:50.729> I

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
not as shocked and I get to the meat I

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.059 
not as shocked and I get to the meat I
haven't<00:05:51.180> really<00:05:51.330> handled<00:05:52.259> anything<00:05:52.470> over<00:05:53.039> i

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
haven't really handled anything over i

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.430 
haven't really handled anything over i
think<00:05:53.310> 370<00:05:53.970> this<00:05:54.150> training<00:05:54.479> block<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.960> i'm

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
think 370 this training block and i'm

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.080 
think 370 this training block and i'm
anticipating<00:05:55.770> on<00:05:56.280> venturing<00:05:56.580> more<00:05:56.789> than<00:05:56.940> that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
anticipating on venturing more than that

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.730 
anticipating on venturing more than that
so<00:05:57.300> you<00:05:57.389> have<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.840> kind<00:05:57.960> of<00:05:58.080> get<00:05:58.199> used<00:05:58.259> to<00:05:58.590> it

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
so you have to kind of get used to it

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.730 
so you have to kind of get used to it
and<00:05:58.889> not<00:05:59.699> be<00:06:00.030> thrown<00:06:00.870> off<00:06:01.050> when<00:06:01.319> the<00:06:01.560> weight<00:06:01.710> is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
and not be thrown off when the weight is

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.649 
and not be thrown off when the weight is
heavy<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.460> get<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.759> lift<00:06:03.000> off<00:06:03.210> at<00:06:03.449> the

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
heavy and you get that lift off at the

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.119 
heavy and you get that lift off at the
meat<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.560> i<00:06:04.590> worked<00:06:04.949> up<00:06:05.129> hit<00:06:05.370> 360<00:06:05.879> 45<00:06:06.800> 394<00:06:07.800> 3

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
meat and so i worked up hit 360 45 394 3

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.249 
meat and so i worked up hit 360 45 394 3
which<00:06:08.879> is<00:06:08.909> when<00:06:09.150> I'm<00:06:09.270> utilized<00:06:09.870> with<00:06:10.110> I'm

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
which is when I'm utilized with I'm

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.700 
which is when I'm utilized with I'm
calling<00:06:10.620> my<00:06:10.770> my<00:06:11.340> single<00:06:11.699> right<00:06:11.879> now<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.710> then

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
calling my my single right now and then

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.529 
calling my my single right now and then
I<00:06:13.740> did<00:06:13.949> 405<00:06:14.520> for<00:06:14.759> a<00:06:14.789> double<00:06:15.120> which<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.389> don't

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
I did 405 for a double which I don't

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.589 
I did 405 for a double which I don't
think<00:06:15.810> I've<00:06:15.990> handled<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:16.830> weight<00:06:17.099> in<00:06:17.909> any

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
think I've handled that weight in any

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.540 
think I've handled that weight in any
form<00:06:18.960> in<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.500> few<00:06:19.680> years<00:06:19.860> since<00:06:20.130> I<00:06:20.340> actually

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
form in a few years since I actually

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.909 
form in a few years since I actually
benched<00:06:21.090> with<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.300> with<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.960> bench<00:06:22.199> Inc<00:06:22.380> shirt<00:06:22.590> so

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
benched with a with a bench Inc shirt so

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.010 
benched with a with a bench Inc shirt so
that<00:06:23.159> was<00:06:23.699> kind<00:06:23.849> of<00:06:23.880> cool<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.509> it<00:06:24.599> felt<00:06:24.870> really

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
that was kind of cool and it felt really

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.399 
that was kind of cool and it felt really
strong<00:06:25.380> and<00:06:25.409> afterwards<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:26.610> felt<00:06:26.639> like<00:06:27.409> it

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
strong and afterwards I felt like it

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.089 
strong and afterwards I felt like it
really<00:06:28.470> did<00:06:29.009> kind<00:06:29.370> of<00:06:29.930> give<00:06:30.930> me<00:06:30.960> a<00:06:31.169> more

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
really did kind of give me a more

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:33.800 
really did kind of give me a more
consistent<00:06:32.610> motor<00:06:32.970> pattern<00:06:33.330> i<00:06:33.419> dropped<00:06:33.659> down

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
consistent motor pattern i dropped down

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.839 
consistent motor pattern i dropped down
to<00:06:33.870> 3<00:06:34.229> 35<00:06:34.680> and<00:06:34.979> those<00:06:35.099> reps<00:06:35.370> felt<00:06:35.610> really

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
to 3 35 and those reps felt really

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.930 
to 3 35 and those reps felt really
strong<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:37.590> wave<00:06:37.740> felt<00:06:38.009> light<00:06:38.190> in<00:06:38.340> my<00:06:38.460> hands

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
strong the wave felt light in my hands

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.309 
strong the wave felt light in my hands
and<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.180> felt<00:06:39.389> like<00:06:39.479> I<00:06:39.569> had<00:06:39.719> really<00:06:39.990> awesome

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
and I felt like I had really awesome

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.050 
and I felt like I had really awesome
control<00:06:40.680> even<00:06:41.009> at<00:06:41.190> the<00:06:41.280> bottom<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:41.669> think<00:06:41.909> that

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
control even at the bottom I think that

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.930 
control even at the bottom I think that
the<00:06:42.469> slingshot<00:06:43.469> kind<00:06:43.949> of<00:06:44.039> reinforced<00:06:44.699> some

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
the slingshot kind of reinforced some

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.370 
the slingshot kind of reinforced some
good<00:06:45.979> pressing<00:06:47.330> motor<00:06:48.330> patterns<00:06:48.719> for<00:06:48.930> me<00:06:49.050> and

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
good pressing motor patterns for me and

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.459 
good pressing motor patterns for me and
I<00:06:49.560> i<00:06:50.360> have<00:06:51.360> to<00:06:51.509> say<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.840> i<00:06:51.870> found<00:06:52.199> it<00:06:52.349> to<00:06:52.440> be

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
I i have to say that i found it to be

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:54.260 
I i have to say that i found it to be
useful<00:06:53.009> which<00:06:53.159> I<00:06:53.310> was<00:06:53.490> not<00:06:53.639> expecting<00:06:53.880> to<00:06:54.180> be

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
useful which I was not expecting to be

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.779 
useful which I was not expecting to be
the<00:06:54.419> case<00:06:54.569> as<00:06:54.810> a<00:06:54.930> Rob<00:06:55.199> venture<00:06:55.740> who<00:06:56.009> never

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
the case as a Rob venture who never

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.159 
the case as a Rob venture who never
really<00:06:57.030> saw<00:06:57.210> the<00:06:57.240> point<00:06:57.419> of<00:06:57.719> it<00:06:57.840> before<00:06:58.139> I

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
really saw the point of it before I

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.779 
really saw the point of it before I
think<00:06:58.680> I<00:06:58.800> might<00:06:58.949> have<00:06:58.979> some<00:06:59.310> use<00:06:59.430> for<00:06:59.460> that<00:06:59.699> in

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
think I might have some use for that in

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:01.330 
think I might have some use for that in
the<00:06:59.849> future<00:07:00.000> not<00:07:00.300> all<00:07:00.360> the<00:07:00.569> time<00:07:00.719> but<00:07:00.779> in

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340
