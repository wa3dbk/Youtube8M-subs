now I'm going to show you a setup shot a
3-ball<00:00:11.590> shot<00:00:11.950> with<00:00:12.430> which<00:00:12.610> we<00:00:12.820> will<00:00:13.000> be<00:00:13.120> able

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
3-ball shot with which we will be able

3-ball shot with which we will be able
to<00:00:13.450> park<00:00:13.690> it

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to park it

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.990 
to park it
are<00:00:15.810> kind<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.110> easy<00:00:16.290> because<00:00:17.070> once<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.760> set

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
are kind of easy because once you set

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.390 
are kind of easy because once you set
the<00:00:18.060> balls<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:19.800> will<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.160> go

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the balls right they will all go

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.530 
the balls right they will all go
automatically<00:00:22.340> in<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.610> particular<00:00:24.119> shot<00:00:24.360> I

directly into the pocket here but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.050 
directly into the pocket here but
slightly<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.720> its<00:01:00.870> left<00:01:01.700> because<00:01:02.700> there<00:01:02.940> will

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
slightly to its left because there will

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.759 
slightly to its left because there will
be<00:01:03.120> some<00:01:03.420> throw<00:01:03.720> as<00:01:03.900> I<00:01:03.930> already<00:01:04.140> explained<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
be some throw as I already explained to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
be some throw as I already explained to
you<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.309> due<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.759> friction<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you so due to the friction that there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
you so due to the friction that there
will<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> between<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.920> two<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> three<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
will be between the two and three the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
will be between the two and three the
three<00:01:09.270> ball<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.780> thrown<00:01:10.079> slightly<00:01:10.829> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
three ball will be thrown slightly to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.390 
three ball will be thrown slightly to
its<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.930> sink<00:01:13.409> will<00:01:14.220> have

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
its right so to make it sink will have

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.350 
its right so to make it sink will have
to<00:01:14.990> point<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> 203<00:01:16.829> towards<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.700> left<00:01:17.939> point

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to point the 203 towards the left point

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.800 
to point the 203 towards the left point
of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> pocket<00:01:19.079> right<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of the pocket right there then a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.709 
of the pocket right there then a
requirement<00:01:22.499> for<00:01:22.649> this<00:01:22.799> shot<00:01:23.069> is<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.719> shoot

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
requirement for this shot is to shoot

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.080 
requirement for this shot is to shoot
with<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:24.990> cue<00:01:25.229> ball<00:01:25.439> behind<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.819> middle

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
with the cue ball behind the the middle

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.410 
with the cue ball behind the the middle
line<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:31.219> to<00:01:32.219> park<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> three<00:01:32.969> balls

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
line here and to park at the three balls

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
line here and to park at the three balls
we'd<00:01:34.229> better<00:01:34.409> care<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.100> about<00:01:35.280> parking<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
we'd better care just about parking the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.639 
we'd better care just about parking the
one<00:01:36.299> ball<00:01:36.479> because<00:01:36.780> everything<00:01:37.259> else<00:01:37.380> has

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
one ball because everything else has

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.139 
one ball because everything else has
already<00:01:37.829> told<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.429> will<00:01:38.639> come<00:01:38.969> out

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
already told you will come out

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.669 
already told you will come out
automatically<00:01:41.479> we<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.319> pocket

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
automatically we all know that to pocket

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.039 
automatically we all know that to pocket
a<00:01:43.770> ball<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.219> frozen<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> rail<00:01:45.049> we

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
a ball that is frozen to the rail we

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.379 
a ball that is frozen to the rail we
need<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.469> hit<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.310> ball<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.819> the<00:01:47.850> rail<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
need to hit the ball in the rail at the

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.910 
need to hit the ball in the rail at the
same<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.469> exactly<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> make<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
same time so exactly here and to make it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
same time so exactly here and to make it
easier<00:01:53.329> it's<00:01:54.329> better<00:01:54.569> to<00:01:54.810> give<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.409> cue<00:01:55.590> ball

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
easier it's better to give the cue ball

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
easier it's better to give the cue ball
some<00:01:56.189> good<00:01:56.459> English<00:01:56.819> in<00:01:56.999> this<00:01:57.119> case<00:01:57.359> it's<00:01:57.630> nine

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
some good English in this case it's nine

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.730 
some good English in this case it's nine
o'clock<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> once<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.079> cue<00:02:01.259> ball<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.590> hit

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
o'clock so once the cue ball will hit

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580 
o'clock so once the cue ball will hit
the<00:02:01.889> one<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.270> sink<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.350> pocket

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the one the one will sink in this pocket

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.099 
the one the one will sink in this pocket
the<00:02:05.279> cue<00:02:05.490> ball<00:02:05.639> will<00:02:05.789> bounce<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.929> rail

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
the cue ball will bounce off the rail

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.290 
the cue ball will bounce off the rail
and<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.160> two<00:02:08.369> ball<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.940> squeezed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and the two ball will be squeezed

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.830 
and the two ball will be squeezed
between<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:10.050> three<00:02:10.380> ball<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> cue<00:02:11.370> ball

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
between the three ball in the cue ball

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.510 
between the three ball in the cue ball
so<00:02:12.840> it'll<00:02:13.560> escape<00:02:14.900> along<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.650> tangent<00:02:17.280> line

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
so it'll escape along the tangent line

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670 
so it'll escape along the tangent line
the<00:02:17.849> tangent<00:02:18.270> line<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> line<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the tangent line is the line that is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.730 
the tangent line is the line that is
perpendicular<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.599> line<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.930> centers<00:02:22.349> so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
perpendicular to the line of centers so

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.330 
perpendicular to the line of centers so
this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> line<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> centers<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
this is the line of centers this is the

this pocket and the three ball get in

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.400 
this pocket and the three ball get in
that<00:02:40.470> pocket<00:02:41.390> I'll<00:02:42.390> show<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.720> how<00:02:48.410> always
