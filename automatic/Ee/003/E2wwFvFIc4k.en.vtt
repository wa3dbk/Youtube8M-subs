00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
inch touch screen actually but I'll see

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.220 
inch touch screen actually but I'll see
if<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> can<00:02:22.790> get<00:02:22.909> another<00:02:23.030> video<00:02:23.300> going<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.140> you

if I can get another video going for you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.000 
if I can get another video going for you
guys<00:02:24.379> later<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:25.450> let's<00:02:26.450> check<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.110> out<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
guys later on let's check this out I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.950 
guys later on let's check this out I
don't<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:28.430> if<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.610> can<00:02:28.760> open<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.300> or<00:02:29.630> what

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
don't know if I can open this or what

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.200 
don't know if I can open this or what
but<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.590> don't<00:02:31.580> really<00:02:31.790> want<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:31.970> mess<00:02:32.120> with

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
but I don't really want to mess with

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.300 
but I don't really want to mess with
that<00:02:32.270> too<00:02:32.480> much<00:02:32.630> oh<00:02:32.750> there<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.960> go<00:02:33.050> flips<00:02:33.410> down

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that too much oh there you go flips down

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.010 
that too much oh there you go flips down
so<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.940> can<00:02:35.030> see<00:02:35.209> there<00:02:35.420> it's<00:02:35.540> got<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> card

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
so you can see there it's got a card

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.760 
so you can see there it's got a card
reader<00:02:36.760> um<00:02:38.800> right<00:02:39.800> here<00:02:39.830> SD<00:02:40.700> card<00:02:40.940> slot<00:02:41.270> I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
reader um right here SD card slot I

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.470 
reader um right here SD card slot I
guess<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.069> where<00:02:43.220> I've<00:02:43.940> connect<00:02:44.270> one<00:02:44.390> of

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
guess this is where I've connect one of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.559 
guess this is where I've connect one of
the<00:02:44.540> charging<00:02:44.990> port<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.319> guess<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:47.090> let's<00:02:47.420> take

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
the charging port I guess and let's take

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.220 
the charging port I guess and let's take
a<00:02:47.630> look

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
a look

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.490 
a look
either<00:02:48.740> micro<00:02:49.310> HDMI<00:02:50.240> or<00:02:50.390> mini<00:02:50.600> HDMI<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.260> can't

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
either micro HDMI or mini HDMI I can't

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.710 
either micro HDMI or mini HDMI I can't
really<00:02:51.590> tell<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:53.060> course<00:02:53.270> there's<00:02:53.540> your

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
really tell and of course there's your

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.760 
really tell and of course there's your
standard<00:02:54.290> um<00:02:54.819> MIT<00:02:55.870> mini<00:02:56.870> charging<00:02:57.290> port<00:02:57.560> there

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
standard um MIT mini charging port there

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.240 
standard um MIT mini charging port there
also<00:02:57.920> many<00:02:58.870> USB<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.470> course<00:03:00.650> there's<00:03:00.980> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
also many USB so of course there's that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.460 
also many USB so of course there's that

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
with that too much but battery of course

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.910 
with that too much but battery of course
is<00:03:28.100> in<00:03:28.250> here<00:03:28.519> pretty<00:03:29.350> really<00:03:30.350> decent<00:03:30.709> looking

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
is in here pretty really decent looking

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.190 
is in here pretty really decent looking
camera<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.340> my<00:03:31.430> opinion<00:03:31.910> hopefully<00:03:32.540> it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
camera in my opinion hopefully it

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.840 
camera in my opinion hopefully it
performs<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:33.739> as<00:03:34.069> well<00:03:34.130> cuz<00:03:34.459> I'm<00:03:34.550> going<00:03:34.760> to

chargers<00:03:42.890> connectors<00:03:44.350> this<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.470> basically<00:03:45.890> it

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
chargers connectors this is basically it

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.630 
chargers connectors this is basically it
and<00:03:47.269> what<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.450> see<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:48.250> pretty<00:03:49.250> much<00:03:49.430> what's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
and what I see here pretty much what's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.569 
and what I see here pretty much what's
in<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:49.970> box<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.360> was<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.430> course

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
in the box that was it so so of course

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:53.830 
in the box that was it so so of course
you<00:03:52.700> got<00:03:52.820> your<00:03:52.880> connection<00:03:53.360> so<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.630> can

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you got your connection so you can

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.819 
you got your connection so you can
connect<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.260> TV<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:56.810> guess<00:03:57.680> you're

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
connect it to a TV and I guess you're

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.750 
connect it to a TV and I guess you're
charging<00:03:58.190> connectors<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.280> battery<00:04:01.549> pack

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
charging connectors and the battery pack

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.479 
charging connectors and the battery pack
as<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.209> see<00:04:02.299> here<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.070> no<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:04.100> guess<00:04:04.340> that's

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
as you can see here so no I guess that's

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.910 
as you can see here so no I guess that's
it<00:04:04.640> for<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.910> unboxing<00:04:05.000> guys<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.840> might<00:04:06.620> try<00:04:06.859> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
it for the unboxing guys I might try to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.979 
it for the unboxing guys I might try to
get<00:04:07.070> another<00:04:07.250> video<00:04:07.579> of<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:08.450> just<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:08.870> you

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
get another video of this just so you

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.890 
get another video of this just so you
all<00:04:09.260> can<00:04:09.290> see<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.769> quality<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.700> video<00:04:11.420> and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
all can see the quality of the video and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.860 
all can see the quality of the video and
as<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.680> can<00:04:12.769> see<00:04:12.950> there<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.420> shut<00:04:14.840> right

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
as you can see there the it's shut right

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.830 
as you can see there the it's shut right
there<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.380> front<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.160> course<00:04:16.810> but<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
there in the front so of course but I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.120 
there in the front so of course but I
guess<00:04:18.169> I'll<00:04:18.289> take<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> look<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.829> we'll<00:04:18.950> see<00:04:19.070> how

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
guess I'll take a look and we'll see how
