 And so people, starting here already 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 our third video from our series 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 summum adventure that is not certain that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 I 'll be bringing you there 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 in each episode bringing command 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 different from that command south to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 invoke a each custom mode 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.660
 Not today's living will be the flip and a good 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.529
 cool for you want to play your friends 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 and as our series says today I do not 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'm alone, guys brought a friend. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 here I think that no one hardly 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.210
 knows and is the coastline of the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.210
 microphone and I will keep presenting 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.230
 I'm from work, my God. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 I got the place in his book he 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 He is talking into that crowd that wants more than 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.489
 he will talk and as a small problem 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 no micro galera but we will go 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.100
 of the page group blog and we're going to 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.119
 Where is your little? 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.829
 It's very cool, people, this business is like this. 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.329
 It's a kind of command for you. 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.280
 summon your pig or close the door and 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.140
 not to escape because it flies not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.119
 Automatically the people here are ours. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.560

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.569
 You will get some of it will seem expensive 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.569

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.229

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.859
