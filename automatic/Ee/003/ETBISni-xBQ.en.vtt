 greater infection control 10 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.760
 then I can consume a shot 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.880
 so that the ratio of the page does not change the street itself

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 with these tricks 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.720
 Although thought why did the scriptures have to train then 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.150

 we can do the depth here under extreme animals 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.920
 that Geithner Soest 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.660

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.270
 that fall out 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690

 to have this pattern 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.330

 like this 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.399
 no idea 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.069
 I can safely say that I can not surrender but not only 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.319
 flexible use 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.539
 Others, too, are chronically persecuted 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.130
 it is not tuned the current one can use with this time 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.049
 Precision is that a website itself is a man

 Press her on top of 13 yards Red Cell 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.649

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.829
 it imitates 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.009

 Skype had but we never had 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:25.839
 that is being researched is being tested by Dipl-ing but if I'm still pretty good at it

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 SMS has become a kind of Stradivarius for Apple 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.909
 she does not tear herself from APA though 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.109

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:49.969
 Tolerance had 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.959
 it should not be that 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.069
 possible 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.199

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.019
 also around 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.499

 its last time 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.979
