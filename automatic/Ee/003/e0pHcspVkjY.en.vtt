paradis you've got to be looking at the
eight<00:01:11.670> legs<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.210> these<00:01:12.360> things<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> end<00:01:13.650> up

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
eight legs of these things so you end up

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.179 
eight legs of these things so you end up
making<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.150> hole<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:16.979> I

outside you then can climb right up the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
outside you then can climb right up the
middle<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.570> you're<00:01:24.840> looking<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
middle bit there and you're looking to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.120 
middle bit there and you're looking to
achieve<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> head<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.049> arab<00:01:28.829> mirror

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
achieve that the head of the arab mirror

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.760 
achieve that the head of the arab mirror
is<00:01:29.549> about<00:01:29.579> an<00:01:30.060> inch<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> below<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> surface

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is about an inch and below the surface

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.760 
is about an inch and below the surface
of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> soil<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.500> bit

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
of the soil so you get it into that bit

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
of the soil so you get it into that bit
there<00:01:34.950> saying<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> heavier<00:01:36.030> soils<00:01:36.540> what

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
there saying in the heavier soils what

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
there saying in the heavier soils what
you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.030> put<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:39.450> grit

you can do is you can put some grit

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
you can do is you can put some grit
around<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> gully<00:01:40.890> area<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.240> keep

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
around in the gully area that will keep

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.480 
around in the gully area that will keep
the<00:01:42.720> Royal<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.320> while<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> water<00:01:44.280> away

literally you've got in there and you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
literally you've got in there and you
start<00:01:49.979> filling<00:01:50.340> back<00:01:50.780> putting<00:01:51.780> down<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.470> legs

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.910 
start filling back putting down the legs
in<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.899> making<00:01:54.899> sure<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.890> are

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
in there and making sure they are

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.990 
in there and making sure they are
sitting<00:01:56.460> quite<00:01:56.790> nice<00:01:57.469> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.070> soil<00:01:59.369> once<00:01:59.850> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
sitting quite nice in the soil once you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850 
sitting quite nice in the soil once you
really<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.630> you're<00:02:00.780> happy<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.829> can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
really think you're happy you can

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.630 
really think you're happy you can
empower<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> soil<00:02:02.850> back<00:02:03.090> further<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.689> again

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
empower the soil back further in again

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.869 
empower the soil back further in again
increasing<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.759> side<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.640> there

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
increasing that side of it and and there

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.900 
increasing that side of it and and there
you<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.140> quite<00:02:10.500> an<00:02:10.679> easy<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.790> look

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you go that is quite an easy way to look

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
you go that is quite an easy way to look
at<00:02:12.060> planting<00:02:12.480> those

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
at planting those

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
at planting those
and<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.490> soil<00:02:14.820> back<00:02:15.060> there<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and you get that soil back there to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.340 
and you get that soil back there to
being<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:17.280> about<00:02:17.670> an<00:02:17.850> inch<00:02:18.030> below<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> level

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
being just about an inch below the level

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.120 
being just about an inch below the level
of<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.530> soil

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
of a soil

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.510 
of a soil
so<00:02:21.230> we've<00:02:22.230> planted<00:02:22.470> one<00:02:22.740> air<00:02:22.890> ramires<00:02:23.310> there

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
so we've planted one air ramires there

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.390 
so we've planted one air ramires there
we<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:24.830> literally<00:02:25.830> look<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> other

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
we can then literally look at the other

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
we can then literally look at the other
one<00:02:26.640> they<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.180> grow<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.840> really<00:02:28.140> tall<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
one they do grow really really tall this

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.770 
one they do grow really really tall this
one<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> variety<00:02:29.280> called<00:02:29.610> robustus<00:02:30.270> which

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
one is a variety called robustus which

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.650 
one is a variety called robustus which
will<00:02:30.930> grow<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.230> six<00:02:31.680> foot<00:02:31.830> tall<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.660> no

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
will grow about six foot tall and no

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.320 
will grow about six foot tall and no
problem<00:02:34.260> putting<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.950> other<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.490> within

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
problem putting the other one and within

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.500 
problem putting the other one and within
about<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.690> foot<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.240> again

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
about a foot and that and then again

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
about a foot and that and then again
because<00:02:39.690> we've<00:02:39.990> got<00:02:40.110> three<00:02:40.380> we'll<00:02:40.980> end<00:02:41.130> up

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
because we've got three we'll end up

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.060 
because we've got three we'll end up
there<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:41.880> we<00:02:42.480> will<00:02:42.690> end<00:02:42.870> up<00:02:43.050> at<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> end<00:02:43.740> of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
there so we will end up at the end of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.880 
there so we will end up at the end of
the<00:02:44.280> year<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:45.120> some<00:02:45.300> gorgeous<00:02:45.570> air<00:02:46.290> Mirasol
