00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
now I'll show you how to build it so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.170 
now I'll show you how to build it so
first<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.479> need<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> rightful<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.180> for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
first you need it to be rightful and for

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
first you need it to be rightful and for
the<00:01:36.270> stock<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:37.140> want<00:01:37.260> aluminum<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the stock you want aluminum but but if

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.250 
the stock you want aluminum but but if
you<00:01:39.180> don't<00:01:39.330> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.510> pay<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.140> can

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
you don't want to pay that much you can

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.050 
you don't want to pay that much you can
just<00:01:40.410> do<00:01:40.560> standard<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.250> doesn't<00:01:41.729> make<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.940> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
just do standard it doesn't make it that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
just do standard it doesn't make it that
it<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.930> makes<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.170> difference<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.619> not

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it kind of makes a difference but not

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.359 
it kind of makes a difference but not
enough<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.790> affect<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.690> weapon<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.770> then

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
enough to affect the weapon and then

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
enough to affect the weapon and then
sugar<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.940> want<00:01:48.060> cine<00:01:48.479> auto<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
sugar you want cine auto so you can just

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
sugar you want cine auto so you can just
shoot<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.770> at<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> time<00:01:50.160> because<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
shoot one at a time because you have

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.800 
shoot one at a time because you have
full<00:01:51.660> auto<00:01:51.840> it'll<00:01:52.320> put<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.500> damage<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:53.810> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
full auto it'll put the damage down and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.710 
full auto it'll put the damage down and
you<00:01:55.080> don't<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.410> so<00:01:56.040> scope<00:01:56.720> preferably

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
you don't want that so scope preferably

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.980 
you don't want that so scope preferably
I<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> three<00:01:58.320> times<00:01:58.880> because<00:01:59.880> 1.5<00:02:00.720> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
I like the three times because 1.5 is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.139 
I like the three times because 1.5 is
not<00:02:01.619> enough<00:02:01.920> zoomed<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.550> sniper<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
not enough zoomed in for a sniper and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.260 
not enough zoomed in for a sniper and
the<00:02:03.840> five<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:05.160> much<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.880> too<00:02:06.149> much

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the five is a little much like too much

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.919 
the five is a little much like too much
for<00:02:06.570> short<00:02:07.110> range<00:02:07.170> shots<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:09.360> magazine<00:02:09.780> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
for short range shots the magazine you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.040 
for short range shots the magazine you
want<00:02:10.080> bolt<00:02:10.350> action<00:02:11.239> because<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.360> adds<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.810> lot

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
want bolt action because it adds a lot

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.880 
want bolt action because it adds a lot
