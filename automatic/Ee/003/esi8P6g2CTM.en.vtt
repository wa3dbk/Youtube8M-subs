00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.040
 for a plant that promises a lot that 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:07.710
 it's moringa 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.250
 I want to thank the engineer 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 environmental 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.910
 natalia corn who was the one who made me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.360
 get this seedling we are 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 experiencing already and notice you in 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.179
 the moringa oleifera that is a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.160
 a plant native to india and is 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:33.570
 recognized by fao with one of the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.180
 Recommended plants to solve 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.490
 some nutrition problems so much 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 human as an animal 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.310
 These are seeds of Paraguay seeds 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 from Paraguay 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.800
 these are African seeds 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 there are practically no differences 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 seen what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.140
 they are very vigorous in the development is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.739
 easy to reproduce we are doing them 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 the test in peeled and unpeeled 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.770
 seeds in reproduction but in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.710
 10 days germinate very well 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.429
 germination is easy but you should 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.369
 Take special care to maintain a 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.819
 humidity or watering every two or three 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.799
 days to have a plant like this one that 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:30.789
 has about a month this plant is 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:35.200
 can directly already do in the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:38.079
 ground or you can make a pot as 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.470
 this one or paper and then take them 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.770
 land 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 the planting density of this plant goes 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.970
 to depend on to be allocated 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.150
 because because it is a plant that at 50 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.480
 days there are others that are already the 30 are 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.450
 can cut like a fodder plant and 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.960
 you can give it to animals with a high 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.409
 protein content see what 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.479
 the whole plant serves for nutrition 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.660
 both in the roots the flowers 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.440
 seeds the leaves that have a high 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.670
 protein content have more 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.709
 proteins that alfalfa 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.209
 It has about 27% protein 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:31.080
 also the seeds and the leaf have more 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.410
 calcium than milk plus vitamin a 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.950
 the carrot and more vitamin c than 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 citrus fruits imagine what a wonderful 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.540
 develops very well and has the property 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.330
 of being able to be cultivated in semi 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.069
 poor and also sometimes poor what 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.870
 you have to do is give the first 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.870
 care for it to develop and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.250
 then it holds up well some periods of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.319
 drought that the plant responds by falling 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.600
 of the leaves but the plant remains 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.700
 when the rain comes it sprouts 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.430
 It gives us a beautiful property 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.750
 food 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.549
 in the countries where it is grown are 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.719
 intended for both feeding 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.540
 human as to the feeding of livestock 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.700
 of the seeds some authors 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.129
 they recommend to toast it and make it as if 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.879
 outside coffee beans are very 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.430
 appetizing and also the 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.480
 oil , oil is an added value 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 very good of very good quality 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.170
 notice you and we are going to make a 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.660
 test 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.630
 this is catastrophe 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:53.930
 and this is the seed of the moringa 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.630
 when this is turned on to be a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.980
 candil will see that it has a good 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.890
 luminosity and has virtually nothing 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.870
 of smoke let's make an experience 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.420
 for you to see it 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.069
 as we can see in both of them once 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.920
 that has already burned the shell in the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.630
 jatropha 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.680
 in moringa it produces a good light 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.730
 bright that allows us to have a good 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.460
 oil lamp 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.280
 and if you want to have not have the 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.520
 initial smoke that can be done 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.250
 only the seed without 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.919
 what it is not to have to do the gas like 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.620
 that is the oil that is used to 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.440
 biofuel 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.040
 these comparisons that I made regarding 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.940
 the luminosity that has one and other 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.430
 seeds jatropha and moringa good 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.440
 to keep it in mind because they have the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.840
 property to be very bright and if they are 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.480
 burned now the seeds 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.680
 practically do not produce smoke 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.230
 the oil that is obtained from the moringa 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.230
 It has much commercial value so much so 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.840
 that is considered equivalent to 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.240
 olive oil 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.780
 for their properties and for their 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.880
 characteristics in the fatty acids that 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.250
 they have in Paraguay there is little 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.639
 information about this plant but what 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.770
 that we have investigated and they tell us 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.550
 that the introduction of latin america 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.800
 it was in 1920 there is a lot of information in 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.680
 internet there are some books in the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.070
 which I have researched and this we have 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.700
 developed us here 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:44.060
 along with technicians like Miguel Alonso 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.660
 that has helped us a lot and the engineering 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.420
 environmental 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.280
 natalia corn to whom we thank 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.600
 a lot for this beautiful work that are 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.000
 performing and can incorporate it 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.050
 the rural environment a plant that can 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.050
 have a lot
