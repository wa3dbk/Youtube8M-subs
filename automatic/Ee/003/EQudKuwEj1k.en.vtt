00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
one of these packs and then it might

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.930 
one of these packs and then it might
prove<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.560> there<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.919> some<00:04:16.190> validity<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.669> my

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
prove that there is some validity to my

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.990 
prove that there is some validity to my

better<00:04:20.150> players<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.780> paying<00:04:21.320> real<00:04:21.530> money<00:04:21.590> is

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
better players and paying real money is

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.350 
better players and paying real money is
what<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.039> mean<00:04:22.250> now<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.729> shows<00:04:22.910> right<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.330> I

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
what I mean now it shows right there I

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.990 
what I mean now it shows right there I

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
no team in the years alright so the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.820 
no team in the years alright so the
first<00:04:33.270> pack<00:04:33.660> we<00:04:33.810> didn't<00:04:33.960> get<00:04:34.050> any<00:04:34.200> tears<00:04:34.650> over

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
first pack we didn't get any tears over

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.990

all<00:04:35.730> is<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> better<00:04:36.180> pack<00:04:36.480> no<00:04:37.230> really<00:04:37.470> I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
all is it a better pack no really I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.690 
all is it a better pack no really I
guess<00:04:39.000> we<00:04:39.150> got<00:04:39.270> an<00:04:39.330> 86<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.810> 87<00:04:40.550> blake<00:04:41.550> wheeler

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
guess we got an 86 and 87 blake wheeler

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.340

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.270 
actually doesn't even sell for that much
I<00:04:43.850> thought<00:04:44.850> he<00:04:44.940> would<00:04:45.060> sell<00:04:45.240> for<00:04:45.270> more<00:04:46.280> and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
I thought he would sell for more and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.370 
I thought he would sell for more and
we'll<00:04:47.550> we'll<00:04:47.850> just<00:04:48.090> auction<00:04:48.510> him<00:04:48.630> up<00:04:48.720> with<00:04:48.870> 900

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
much so so far my theory is just a bunch

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.950 
much so so far my theory is just a bunch
