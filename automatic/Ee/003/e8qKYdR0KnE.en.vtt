00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.700
 We introduce how to choose Nordic many pole 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.580
 Thank you in advance 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:20.090
 What triggered you to start the practice mouth of the last day? 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 I wanted to try and hear that it was more effective than walking 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:31.480
 About how to choose of it is in Asore goods 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:36.440
 This is because there are two types of poles depending on how you walk 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.540
 The first one is the ninth from the grip of the natural body 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.720
 Aggressive meeting 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.610
 There are two types of grip 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.790
 2 types or yes 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.230
 We will introduce in the first type of natural body grip 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.990
 The first feature is 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 The thumb is put on the top when going to the law 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.710
 Then to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.120
 The shaft is slightly bent to achieve a natural wrist angle when the ball is built 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:12.960
 Then when you bring it in front of Poe 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:17.380
 The wings are attached here so as to fit firmly 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.950
 To be stable when the port is attached 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.020
 Gon is a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 That 's why I have a long head 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.580
 As easy to use even more of beginners 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.960
 It is 4 that it is relatively easy to convey 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.960
 Another one is yes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.620
 Another one is the pole for Able branch , and this one is 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 To strap 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.080
 I firmly affirm in Mel Island 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.080
 Firm to 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.130
 You can fix it so that the power can be transmitted Yes 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.520
 Then so as not to stuffiness It is this strap 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 Mesh material comes with quick-drying material 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.940
 Then a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 For example because that would in this way fixed 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:16.090
 I can't usually get it, but by pressing the red button here too 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.340
 The stamp is coming off 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 Finally it is the rubber of the tip 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.629
 Stick the pole firmly 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.629
 This soft but with the floor part to clip 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.870
 The v-shaped sole looks like a human foot 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 Attached to the firm ground 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.170
 Because it means 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.740
 I walk in a large area quickly for the purpose of loading so 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.100
 Facing those who say 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:53.150
 Will be in port Yes By the way, I would Which is good 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.940
 I do not have almost nothing Do you have been from the usual exercise 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 That's right then 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.960
 this 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:07.190
 I think the type of natural body grip is recommended 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.260
 What should I do for length ? 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.409
 in this way 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.489
 Because I slide, my walkable Hase 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:22.250
 It would be good to receive 7 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:28.640
 Carrying is yes This is because many are the shortest 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.250
 Yeah this way, people also Toka train movement of thought because there is also a compact Lie made type 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.020
 Here 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.580
 You should choose a type 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:43.610
 Yes I think you are Well then I understand and I want to use the pole of this natural body grip 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.610
 Yes, let's go immediately to walk in
