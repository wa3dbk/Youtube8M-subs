players<00:01:29.660> attacks<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:30.680> also<00:01:30.860> have<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.190> worry

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
players attacks you also have to worry

players attacks you also have to worry
about<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:31.729> small<00:01:32.030> dot<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> center<00:01:32.720> of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
about this small dot in the center of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.139 
about this small dot in the center of
the<00:01:32.930> screen<00:01:33.200> which<00:01:33.770> represents<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.610> Sun<00:01:34.850> and

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
the screen which represents the Sun and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.190 
the screen which represents the Sun and
if<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.840> accidentally<00:01:36.380> touch<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.070> die<00:01:38.200> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
if you accidentally touch it you die the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.350 
if you accidentally touch it you die the
Sun<00:01:39.410> also<00:01:39.830> has<00:01:40.009> its<00:01:40.190> own<00:01:40.280> gravitational<00:01:40.880> pull

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
Sun also has its own gravitational pull

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.449 
Sun also has its own gravitational pull
so<00:01:41.840> if<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.020> travel<00:01:42.200> too<00:01:42.500> close<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.039> it'll

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
so if you travel too close to it it'll

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.949 
so if you travel too close to it it'll
get<00:01:43.520> sucked<00:01:43.819> in<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.000> killed<00:01:45.039> what<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.069> bitch

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
get sucked in and killed what a bitch

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.059 
get sucked in and killed what a bitch
now<00:01:47.959> it<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.200> possible<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.740> use<00:01:48.830> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
now it is possible to use the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.010 
now it is possible to use the
gravitational<00:01:49.759> pull<00:01:49.910> to<00:01:50.060> your<00:01:50.149> advantage<00:01:50.479> by

gravitational pull to your advantage by

slingshotting your shots around the Sun

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.870 
slingshotting your shots around the Sun
just<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:54.979> sure<00:01:55.190> you<00:01:55.310> don't<00:01:55.459> accidentally

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
just make sure you don't accidentally

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.610 
just make sure you don't accidentally
kill<00:01:56.149> yourself

game computer space never caught on and

game computer space never caught on and
it<00:05:12.139> was<00:05:12.259> most<00:05:12.530> likely<00:05:12.620> caused<00:05:13.160> by<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.400> game's

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
it was most likely caused by the game's

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.450 
it was most likely caused by the game's
complicated<00:05:14.300> controls<00:05:14.750> since<00:05:15.710> each<00:05:15.979> ship<00:05:16.250> had

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
complicated controls since each ship had

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.310 
complicated controls since each ship had
to<00:05:16.490> be<00:05:16.669> controlled<00:05:17.000> by<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.300> set<00:05:17.599> four<00:05:17.900> buttons

to be controlled by a set four buttons
it<00:05:18.680> was<00:05:18.860> just<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.160> little<00:05:19.310> bit<00:05:19.580> too<00:05:19.759> much<00:05:19.910> for

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
it was just a little bit too much for

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.170 
it was just a little bit too much for
people<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.570> absorb<00:05:21.460> if<00:05:22.460> Nolan<00:05:22.820> learned

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
people to absorb if Nolan learned

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
anything from this experience it was

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.650 
anything from this experience it was
that<00:05:25.400> he<00:05:25.550> would<00:05:25.699> have<00:05:25.849> to<00:05:26.030> keep<00:05:26.210> things<00:05:26.449> simple

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660
