00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.010
 what would you like to make a cushion like that? 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.440
 of superchulo for the bed of your 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.840
 children to yes but to what to take the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.940
 thread to the needle the scissors to prick the 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.210
 from where brand the needle the old 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.700
 that's not fun and so 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.130
 Today we bring you the ideal cushion for 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.080
 lazy when sewing a cushion 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.210
 that does not have seams neither one nor one 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.850
 attention because it's worth the same for 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.829
 that the drivers like the needle there goes 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.199
 there is proof and it is possible and everything 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.399
 do it without car and without threading that is 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.499
 that really is a tragedy very well 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.960
 declared x is good and I tell you that to me 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:51.199
 grandmother always put me has several 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.600
 lucky and clear needles now I am 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.719
 the one that puts we are that we have brought this 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.940
 this new invention that good is a cushion 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.339
 what can we do with any fabric 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.469
 that we have a fabric that we no longer use 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.909
 one that we want to buy or know that 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.680
 really what we have is very little 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.280
 thing to see that we need then that the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.280
 cloth 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.549
 glue and glue and we should put 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 filling if we want to put eyes then another 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 different type of fabric if we can put 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 little eyes we can put cadiz this has 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
 You can make a face of a rogue 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 good of monster bad guys and everything 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.039
 It depends on the eyes and therefore depends 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.869
 what we want to beat him with belts 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.409
 then we can work with any 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.350
 way we can make like this a diamond 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.020
 we can make a circle or we can do 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.330
 a rectangle like in this case this what 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 I made with fabric of a shirt is a 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.479
 fabric of a shirt that we have for 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.280
 house that we did not arrive since we did not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.810
 he liked that we looked good and then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 because it carries the main cuts 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 also in the forgotten say that it is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.570
 important that we have a safety pin or 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.610
 something to hold the two fabrics 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.260
 we cut it for example the shirt by 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.930
 the front part and the part of 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.770
 back we cut it with the shape that we 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.209
 fancy we need in a rectangle 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.459
 we hold with a brooch but I want 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.150
 things do not disappear by saying 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.730
 that and we have everything together that we have 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.410
 what to do then simply him without any 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.360
 mystery 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.940
 silvia we cut the corners first 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.280
 that are in a different way with a 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.880
 way as to which course they are for the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.040
 we have to start and nothing is to cut 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.560
 and always with the same depth more or 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.630
 less always always to be able to tie you 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.780
 then of course it leaves me a little bit more 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.910
 I come back to make room for a couple 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.570
 of blows and so it is and nothing because we're going 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 getting in, we're cutting off all 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.410
 those that we want thinner shorter what 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.890
 what are we going to do unequal or equal 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.530
 we come to the corner 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.850
 and the same thing we got back in shape 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.520
 of diamond like that and that is in the corner 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.280
 corner is the one that has the piquito 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.480
 exactly then 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 it's different it's different and that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.630
 we have to do then knot nothing more 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.750
 said nothing else nothing else this there 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.370
 I bring you and I bring you done with all 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.260
 knots because if we do not take long 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.780
 Well, we have made a knot and what 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 we walked to see how we are going to 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.330
 make one so you can see what it is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 well the knot of all life that does not have 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.410
 no mystery 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.400
 here is another upside down and pulling upside down 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.560
 and it is already 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.430
 we already have that does not loose with anything 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 now we can fill it in 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.989
 left a gap because if we now 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.459
 we can not put the filling and 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.050
 simply because nothing is going to 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.170
 enter it 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.240
 inside our cushion by the two 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.980
 sides like this 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.290
 until we fill in the structure 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.650
 of the bridge is sufficiently filled 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.230
 that normalito but blandito thus is and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.480
 simply because it does not end and ideally 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.790
 would always start adapting the knots 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.830
 by the corners if that is ideal for 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.680
 that they go apart from what we have put 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.820
 our pin so that it does not move us 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.040
 well that way we will not fail 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.280
 I never started at the corners because 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.890
 corners as you see here are the ones that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.530
 they have the different form to the rest of 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.030
 the cuts that are rectangular so in 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.880
 this case the corner has no way of 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.620
 trapeze and so we do not get caught 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.540
 one from the corner with the one next to it 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.390
 it's not from the corner with the cabals and 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.000
 nothing, we've almost finished 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.150
 well what is the difficulty you see 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.340
 which is minimal 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.590
 and you're just seeing nothing comes out of 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.080
 stuffed but kids can do it 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.970
 because they 're going to click on us with nothing and 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.430
 Well , really, it's already 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.560
 our sun would be over and nothing 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.240
 because a sun would be a matter of putting 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.560
 what you want the little face 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.670
 little flowers or a brooch quoted a flower if 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.740
 what was all is fine as 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.460
 We want to decorate and we already have our 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.930
 sun would not have more mystery then to 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.930
 his sun bed laid
