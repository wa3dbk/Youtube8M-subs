00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
seriously when looking at how to improve

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
seriously when looking at how to improve
on<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> physical<00:01:07.650> keyboard<00:01:07.830> also

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
on that so the physical keyboard also

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
on that so the physical keyboard also
has<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:09.420> on-screen<00:01:09.960> presence<00:01:10.200> something

that's adaptive the changes with with

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190 
that's adaptive the changes with with
content<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.310> allow<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> frame<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.600> function

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
content to allow the frame to function

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
content to allow the frame to function
as<00:01:16.320> part<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> RF<00:01:17.100> antenna<00:01:17.330> we<00:01:18.330> created<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
as part of the RF antenna we created a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.190 
as part of the RF antenna we created a
split<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> bottom<00:01:19.890> where<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:21.020> located<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
split in the bottom where we located the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
split in the bottom where we located the
connector<00:01:22.560> board<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.610> steel<00:01:23.850> i-beams<00:01:24.360> used

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
connector board the steel i-beams used

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
connector board the steel i-beams used
in<00:01:25.200> modernist<00:01:25.650> architecture<00:01:26.280> really

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
in modernist architecture really

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.940 
in modernist architecture really
inspired<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.960> integration<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> frame

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
inspired the integration of the frame

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
inspired the integration of the frame
into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.670> body<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> device<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.740> a
