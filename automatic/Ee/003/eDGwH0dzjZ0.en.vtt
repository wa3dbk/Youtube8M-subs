00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
really it's got a limit on how big you

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.230 
really it's got a limit on how big you
make<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.020> they<00:01:44.500> can<00:01:44.649> be<00:01:44.710> as<00:01:45.460> big<00:01:45.820> as<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.030> want

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240

as<00:01:46.390> small<00:01:46.689> as<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.899> want

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
as small as you want

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.740 
as small as you want
and<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.880> doesn't<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.270> look<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:49.570> this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
and it doesn't have to look like this

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.819 
and it doesn't have to look like this
this<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:50.500> my<00:01:51.299> prototype<00:01:52.299> I<00:01:52.509> guess<00:01:52.719> but<00:01:53.590> just

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
this is my prototype I guess but just

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.459 
this is my prototype I guess but just
have<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.159> to<00:01:54.310> where<00:01:54.490> players<00:01:55.030> can't<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.689> you

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
have it to where players can't like you

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.399 
have it to where players can't like you
know<00:01:56.590> jump<00:01:56.979> out<00:01:57.189> or<00:01:57.430> escape<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.409> arena

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
know jump out or escape the arena

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.719 
know jump out or escape the arena
because<00:01:59.829> I<00:01:59.979> would<00:02:00.130> defeat<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.460> whole<00:02:00.579> purpose

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
because I would defeat the whole purpose

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.779 
because I would defeat the whole purpose
of<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.570> plugin<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.460> players<00:02:03.460> would<00:02:03.670> be<00:02:03.759> able

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
of this plugin and players would be able

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.149 
of this plugin and players would be able
to<00:02:04.030> allow<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.320> players<00:02:05.560> would<00:02:05.710> be<00:02:05.829> able<00:02:05.950> to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
to allow the players would be able to

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.219 
to allow the players would be able to
cheat<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:07.030> mess<00:02:07.600> out<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> plug<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.170> if

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
cheat and just mess out the plug in if

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.850 
cheat and just mess out the plug in if
they<00:02:08.350> jump<00:02:08.619> out<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.009> stuff<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.390> yeah
