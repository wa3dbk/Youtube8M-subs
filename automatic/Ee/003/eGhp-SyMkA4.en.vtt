00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
some people can say you can do this with

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.290 
some people can say you can do this with
other<00:02:41.740> applications<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.120> much

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
other applications it's just much

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.560 
other applications it's just much
simpler<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:43.960> like<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:44.500> Google<00:02:45.340> neither<00:02:46.060> its

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
simpler but like with Google neither its

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.530 
simpler but like with Google neither its
recently<00:02:47.200> celebrate<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:49.060> probably<00:02:49.270> not

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
recently celebrate that's probably not

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.020 
recently celebrate that's probably not
going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.810> compete<00:02:50.140> with<00:02:51.030> productivity

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
going to compete with productivity

software<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.630> Microsoft<00:02:53.020> Office<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:54.160> as<00:02:54.820> far

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
software like Microsoft Office is as far

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.780 
software like Microsoft Office is as far
as<00:02:55.300> one<00:02:55.510> person<00:02:55.720> using<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.440> mean<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
as one person using it I mean it is the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
as one person using it I mean it is the
main<00:02:58.120> reason<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> use<00:02:58.990> this<00:02:59.140> here<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.590> when<00:02:59.890> you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
main reason to use this here is when you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.850 
main reason to use this here is when you
have<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.400> group<00:03:00.760> using<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.380> need<00:03:02.590> one

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
have a group using it and you need one

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.590 
have a group using it and you need one
version<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.460> file<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.090> need<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.390> keep

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
version of the file and you need to keep

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.360 
version of the file and you need to keep
it<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.960> sync<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.860> have<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> set<00:03:06.280> of
