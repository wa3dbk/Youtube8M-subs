00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
can start making feta begin by putting

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840 
can start making feta begin by putting
your<00:00:38.600> heat<00:00:38.810> on<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.050> low<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.380> medium<00:00:39.710> setting<00:00:40.250> so

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
your heat on a low to medium setting so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.389 
your heat on a low to medium setting so
that<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:41.149> milk<00:00:41.329> heats<00:00:41.600> up<00:00:41.750> gradually<00:00:42.380> I<00:00:42.560> would

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
that the milk heats up gradually I would

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.740 
that the milk heats up gradually I would
recommend<00:00:43.850> taking<00:00:43.970> your<00:00:44.270> milk<00:00:44.420> out<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
recommend taking your milk out of the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.660 
recommend taking your milk out of the
fridge<00:00:44.780> about<00:00:45.200> 30<00:00:45.530> minutes<00:00:45.890> before<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.370> begin

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
fridge about 30 minutes before you begin

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.819 
fridge about 30 minutes before you begin
so<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.360> milk<00:00:47.540> has<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> chance<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.140> warm<00:00:48.470> up<00:00:48.620> and

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
so the milk has a chance to warm up and

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.049 
so the milk has a chance to warm up and
doesn't<00:00:49.160> get<00:00:49.280> too<00:00:49.460> shocked<00:00:49.760> by<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
doesn't get too shocked by the

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.319 
doesn't get too shocked by the
temperature<00:00:50.510> change<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.520> this<00:00:52.520> video<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:52.969> will

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
temperature change in this video I will

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.270

congratulations<00:03:52.260> you've<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.680> made<00:03:53.160> curd

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.979 

the<00:04:06.719> next<00:04:06.989> step<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.709> cut<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.010> curd

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
the next step is to cut the curd

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.970 
the next step is to cut the curd
essentially<00:04:09.989> we're<00:04:10.140> cutting<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.500> curd<00:04:10.709> so

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
essentially we're cutting the curd so

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.550 
essentially we're cutting the curd so
that<00:04:11.099> we<00:04:11.219> can<00:04:11.400> release<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.939> way<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.510> form<00:04:13.409> an

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
that we can release the way and form an

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.729 
that we can release the way and form an
even<00:04:13.890> stronger<00:04:14.250> massive<00:04:15.150> curd<00:04:15.359> we<00:04:16.350> want<00:04:16.590> to

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
even stronger massive curd we want to

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.490 
even stronger massive curd we want to
cut<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.190> curd<00:04:17.430> into<00:04:17.759> a<00:04:17.940> grid<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.509> we<00:04:19.229> want<00:04:19.410> to

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
cut the curd into a grid and we want to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.770 
cut the curd into a grid and we want to
do<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.769> over<00:04:20.009> a<00:04:20.190> period<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.820> five<00:04:21.329> minutes<00:04:23.780> so

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
do this over a period of five minutes so

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.680 
do this over a period of five minutes so
for<00:04:25.020> example<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:26.130> want<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.400> make<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> cut<00:04:26.820> wait

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
for example you want to make a cut wait

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.170 
for example you want to make a cut wait
for<00:04:27.960> 30<00:04:28.530> seconds<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.220> then<00:04:29.460> make<00:04:29.669> another<00:04:29.940> cut

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
for 30 seconds and then make another cut

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.450 
for 30 seconds and then make another cut
and<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:31.169> will<00:04:31.350> just<00:04:31.470> help<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.800> release<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
and this will just help to release the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.310 
and this will just help to release the
way<00:04:32.610> from<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.150> curd<00:04:33.389> mass<00:04:36.050> remember<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.169> make

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
way from the curd mass remember to make

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.080 
way from the curd mass remember to make
sure<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.710> your<00:04:37.860> knife<00:04:38.039> cuts<00:04:38.370> reach<00:04:38.699> all<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
sure that your knife cuts reach all the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:05:06.820 
sure that your knife cuts reach all the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
cloth as thick as you like and keep in

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.580 
cloth as thick as you like and keep in
mind<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.400> if<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.640> have<00:05:23.880> a<00:05:24.390> fairly<00:05:24.930> weak<00:05:25.260> curd

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
mind that if you have a fairly weak curd

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.140 
mind that if you have a fairly weak curd
then<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.980> might<00:05:26.160> want<00:05:26.370> to<00:05:26.460> double<00:05:26.850> up<00:05:26.940> the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
then you might want to double up the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.560 
then you might want to double up the
cheese<00:05:27.390> cloth<00:05:28.080> so<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.430> doesn't<00:05:30.060> drip<00:05:30.300> through

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.050 

now<00:05:33.570> we're<00:05:33.780> ready<00:05:33.960> for<00:05:34.200> stirring<00:05:34.670> we<00:05:35.670> do<00:05:35.880> this

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
now we're ready for stirring we do this

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.940 
now we're ready for stirring we do this
because<00:05:36.240> we<00:05:36.540> want<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.810> release<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.440> way<00:05:37.590> from

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
because we want to release the way from

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.840 
because we want to release the way from
the<00:05:38.070> curd<00:05:39.650> you<00:05:40.650> generally<00:05:41.130> want<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.400> stir<00:05:41.670> your

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
the curd you generally want to stir your

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.180 
the curd you generally want to stir your
curd<00:05:42.090> for<00:05:42.270> about<00:05:42.480> 15<00:05:42.930> or<00:05:43.080> 20<00:05:43.110> minutes<00:05:43.410> it

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
curd for about 15 or 20 minutes it

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.890 
curd for about 15 or 20 minutes it
really<00:05:44.430> gives<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:44.760> a<00:05:44.850> chance<00:05:45.090> to<00:05:45.360> root<00:05:45.570> have

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
really gives it a chance to root have

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.690 
really gives it a chance to root have
the<00:05:46.170> way<00:05:46.350> release<00:05:46.800> from<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.280> curd<00:05:47.490> and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
the way release from the curd and

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.910 
the way release from the curd and
eventually<00:05:48.600> you<00:05:48.690> want<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.410> settle<00:05:49.650> to

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
eventually you want it to just settle to

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.350 
eventually you want it to just settle to
the<00:05:49.950> bottom<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.550> pot<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:50.790> you'll<00:05:51.120> see

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
the bottom of the pot and you'll see

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.660 
the bottom of the pot and you'll see
that<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:52.050> yellow<00:05:52.410> whey<00:05:52.770> will<00:05:53.070> rise<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.640> the

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
that the yellow whey will rise to the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:03.440 
that the yellow whey will rise to the
top<00:06:00.950> as<00:06:01.950> you<00:06:02.160> can<00:06:02.340> see<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.790> is<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> fairly

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
top as you can see this is a fairly

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.950 
top as you can see this is a fairly
wheat<00:06:03.960> curd<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.560> if<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.820> wanted<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.690> make<00:06:06.840> it

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
wheat curd and if you wanted to make it

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.230 
wheat curd and if you wanted to make it
stronger<00:06:07.260> you<00:06:07.590> can<00:06:07.800> put<00:06:08.100> it<00:06:08.220> back<00:06:08.490> on<00:06:08.730> a<00:06:08.970> low

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
stronger you can put it back on a low

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.950 
stronger you can put it back on a low
temperature<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.290> stir<00:06:11.390> for<00:06:12.390> about<00:06:12.630> five

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
temperature and stir for about five

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.260 
temperature and stir for about five
minutes<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.740> what<00:06:14.370> it's<00:06:14.490> going<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.640> do<00:06:14.910> is

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
minutes and what it's going to do is

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.370 
minutes and what it's going to do is
help<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.320> curd<00:06:16.920> mass<00:06:17.450> just<00:06:18.450> to<00:06:18.630> become<00:06:18.900> that

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
help the curd mass just to become that

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.980 
help the curd mass just to become that
much<00:06:19.560> stronger

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.810 

now<00:06:25.990> that<00:06:26.200> your<00:06:26.440> card<00:06:27.130> has<00:06:27.310> settled<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:27.790> the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
now that your card has settled to the

depending on the type of milk you use

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.450 
depending on the type of milk you use

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
especially if you use goat's milk you

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.310 
especially if you use goat's milk you
might<00:06:45.640> find<00:06:45.850> that<00:06:45.970> you<00:06:46.120> have<00:06:46.330> excess<00:06:46.960> curd

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
might find that you have excess curd

that won't fit into the cheese mold just
wait<00:06:50.110> a<00:06:50.320> few<00:06:50.350> minutes<00:06:50.770> until<00:06:51.100> all<00:06:51.490> of<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.760> way

the next 12 to 24 hours I often like to
put<00:07:14.980> a<00:07:15.010> bit<00:07:15.280> of<00:07:15.310> a<00:07:15.460> weight<00:07:15.700> on<00:07:15.730> top<00:07:16.210> of<00:07:16.420> the

put a bit of a weight on top of the

put a bit of a weight on top of the

cheese to help release the way more

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.720 
cheese to help release the way more
quickly<00:07:19.180> it's<00:07:20.020> also<00:07:20.200> a<00:07:20.350> good<00:07:20.530> idea<00:07:20.590> to<00:07:20.920> flip

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730 
quickly it's also a good idea to flip

quickly it's also a good idea to flip
the<00:07:21.910> cheese<00:07:22.120> within<00:07:22.540> the<00:07:22.660> first<00:07:22.900> two<00:07:23.140> hours<00:07:23.320> a

the cheese within the first two hours a
few<00:07:23.950> times<00:07:24.220> to<00:07:25.030> evenly<00:07:25.360> distribute<00:07:25.960> the<00:07:25.990> way

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290 
few times to evenly distribute the way

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.520 
few times to evenly distribute the way
being<00:07:26.950> released<00:07:29.910> after<00:07:30.910> about<00:07:31.570> 18<00:07:31.960> hours<00:07:32.140> your

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
being released after about 18 hours your

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.860 
being released after about 18 hours your
cheese<00:07:32.800> should<00:07:32.980> be<00:07:33.100> quite<00:07:33.370> firm<00:07:33.610> if<00:07:33.880> you

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
cheese should be quite firm if you

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.230 
cheese should be quite firm if you
desire<00:07:35.230> a<00:07:35.260> really<00:07:35.830> dry<00:07:36.340> feta<00:07:36.640> then<00:07:37.030> it<00:07:37.120> would

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
desire a really dry feta then it would
