tried<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> once<00:00:24.590> I've<00:00:25.590> tried<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.160> vinegar

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
tried it once I've tried with vinegar

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:36.709 
tried it once I've tried with vinegar
kind<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.859> felt<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.820> less<00:00:31.520> dirty<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:35.719> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
kind of felt a little less dirty but it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.430 
kind of felt a little less dirty but it
wasn't<00:00:37.140> clean<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:38.610> wasn't<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.120> clean<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.960> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
wasn't clean it wasn't really clean so I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
wasn't clean it wasn't really clean so I
got<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.309> flax<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.600> try

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
got some flax and I was going to try

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
got some flax and I was going to try
that<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.739> before<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that but before I got on to that I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
that but before I got on to that I
wanted<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.570> try<00:00:46.010> baking<00:00:47.010> soda<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wanted to try baking soda and I did a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
wanted to try baking soda and I did a
little<00:00:49.590> bit<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> research<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> seemed

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
little bit of research and it seemed

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
little bit of research and it seemed
pretty<00:00:51.329> easy<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:52.320> teaspoon<00:00:52.860> baking<00:00:53.129> soda<00:00:53.280> per

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
pretty easy one teaspoon baking soda per

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.930 
pretty easy one teaspoon baking soda per
cup<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.239> hot<00:00:54.449> water<00:00:55.460> take<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> shower

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cup of hot water take into the shower

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.500 
cup of hot water take into the shower
with<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:58.039> do<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.190> thing<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.789> rinse<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
with you do your thing I rinse with the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410 
with you do your thing I rinse with the
vinegar<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> feels<00:01:03.059> pretty

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
vinegar and I think it feels pretty

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.539 
vinegar and I think it feels pretty
clean<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.220> think<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.369> feels<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:06.030> clean

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:20.060
