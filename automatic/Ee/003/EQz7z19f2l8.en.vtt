we<00:00:22.480> think<00:00:22.690> between<00:00:23.230> us<00:00:23.350> we<00:00:23.470> think<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.800> maps

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
we think between us we think the maps

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.310 
we think between us we think the maps
have<00:00:24.190> probably<00:00:24.490> got<00:00:24.700> the<00:00:24.820> edge<00:00:24.970> you<00:00:25.630> know<00:00:25.750> and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
have probably got the edge you know and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.260 
have probably got the edge you know and
set<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.650> fantastic<00:00:27.280> lady<00:00:27.430> but<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.760> max<00:00:28.060> you

know we'll talk about now and the max
just<00:00:30.700> blurting<00:00:31.060> wireman<00:00:31.450> I'll<00:00:31.570> slice<00:00:31.840> it

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
just blurting wireman I'll slice it

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.350 
just blurting wireman I'll slice it
certainly<00:00:32.920> dead<00:00:33.100> at<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.309> fact<00:00:33.550> that<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:34.180> coin

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
certainly dead at the fact that the coin

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.930 
certainly dead at the fact that the coin
toss<00:00:34.660> has<00:00:34.690> been<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.200> chemical<00:00:36.010> to<00:00:36.250> to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
toss has been so chemical to to

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.520 
toss has been so chemical to to
tonight's<00:00:37.239> meeting<00:00:37.630> really<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.960> inside<00:00:38.260> gate

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
tonight's meeting really the inside gate

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.500 
tonight's meeting really the inside gate
has<00:00:38.739> been<00:00:38.770> so<00:00:39.190> advantageous<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.120> bit<00:00:40.330> like<00:00:40.480> a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
has been so advantageous is a bit like a

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
has been so advantageous is a bit like a
day/night<00:00:41.170> cricket<00:00:41.590> match<00:00:41.739> you<00:00:41.980> know<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
day/night cricket match you know the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.460 
day/night cricket match you know the
current<00:00:42.610> sources<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.449> massive<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.260> know

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
current sources is massive and you know

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.170 
current sources is massive and you know
the<00:00:44.739> inside<00:00:45.250> gates<00:00:45.550> appear<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.879> particular

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
the inside gates appear the particular

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.780 
the inside gates appear the particular
advantage<00:00:46.870> tonight<00:00:47.080> under<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.860> think<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> max

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
advantage tonight under I think the max

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.820 
advantage tonight under I think the max
is<00:00:49.000> probably<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.809> submit<00:00:50.110> might<00:00:50.350> be<00:00:50.500> out<00:00:50.620> with

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
is probably to submit might be out with

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.680 
is probably to submit might be out with
hands<00:00:51.100> in<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.340> first<00:00:51.550> corner<00:00:51.850> we'll<00:00:52.330> see<00:00:52.510> what

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
hands in the first corner we'll see what

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.810 
hands in the first corner we'll see what
happens<00:00:53.080> out<00:00:53.260> so<00:00:53.410> anyone<00:00:53.680> people<00:00:54.370> are<00:00:54.430> biting
