Von<00:00:04.500> D<00:00:04.680> lock-it<00:00:05.160> foundation<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.480> in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
Von D lock-it foundation I have this in

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.080 
Von D lock-it foundation I have this in
the<00:00:06.839> shade<00:00:07.049> light<00:00:07.290> 48<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:08.940> color

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
the shade light 48 and for color

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.810 
the shade light 48 and for color
reference<00:00:09.510> I'm<00:00:09.690> between<00:00:09.960> NC<00:00:10.440> 20<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.980> 225<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
reference I'm between NC 20 and 225 and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
reference I'm between NC 20 and 225 and
Mac<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.509> shade<00:00:12.809> works<00:00:13.380> pretty<00:00:13.740> well<00:00:13.889> for

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
Mac and this shade works pretty well for

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.310 
Mac and this shade works pretty well for
me<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:15.000> does<00:00:15.179> tend<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> oxidize<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.870> little<00:00:16.199> bit

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
me it does tend to oxidize a little bit

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160 
me it does tend to oxidize a little bit
so<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> gets<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.119> tad<00:00:18.570> bit<00:00:18.900> too

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
so it kind of gets to be a tad bit too

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.590 
so it kind of gets to be a tad bit too
dark<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.590> me<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.100> overall<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:21.090> works<00:00:21.240> fine

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
dark for me but overall it works fine

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
dark for me but overall it works fine
especially<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> summer<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.340> if

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
especially in the summer I think that if

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.279 
especially in the summer I think that if
I<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.420> bit<00:00:24.600> more<00:00:24.779> color<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> this

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I get a little bit more color and this

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.750 
I get a little bit more color and this
will<00:00:25.470> work<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.920> well<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
will work really well this is what the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
will work really well this is what the
packaging<00:00:27.150> looks<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> even<00:00:27.960> though<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
packaging looks like and even though the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
packaging looks like and even though the
bottle<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.740> tube<00:00:29.039> looks<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.910> pretty

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
bottle or the tube looks to be pretty

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
bottle or the tube looks to be pretty
big<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:30.960> getting<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.769> fluid<00:00:32.070> ounce<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
big you are getting one fluid ounce of

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.340 
big you are getting one fluid ounce of
products<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.020> typical

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
products in here which is the typical

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
products in here which is the typical
amount<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> foundation<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.670> when

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
amount of foundation you would get when

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.760 
amount of foundation you would get when
you<00:00:36.390> first<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> actually<00:00:37.320> comes<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you first get it it actually comes with

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
you first get it it actually comes with
this<00:00:37.920> little<00:00:38.190> stopper<00:00:38.670> attached<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this little stopper attached to and it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.319 
this little stopper attached to and it
plugs<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:39.989> into<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.550> nozzle<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
plugs right into the little nozzle to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
plugs right into the little nozzle to
block<00:00:42.690> any<00:00:42.930> products<00:00:43.379> from<00:00:43.530> coming<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
block any products from coming out and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.350 
block any products from coming out and
this<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.030> prevents<00:00:45.539> any<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:47.360> accidental

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this also prevents any like accidental

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
this also prevents any like accidental
pushings<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> pump<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.039> dispense

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
pushings of the pump because to dispense

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
pushings of the pump because to dispense
the<00:00:50.520> product<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> press<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> then

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the product you press up here and then

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.799 
the product you press up here and then
the<00:00:52.260> product<00:00:52.559> will<00:00:52.649> come<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> nozzle

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
the product will come out of the nozzle

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.260 
the product will come out of the nozzle
so<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.379> nice<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.920> prevents<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so this is nice because it prevents you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.060 
so this is nice because it prevents you
from<00:00:57.300> accidentally<00:00:58.079> pushing<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> product

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
from accidentally pushing it in product

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.500 
from accidentally pushing it in product
leaking<00:00:59.640> out<00:00:59.760> so<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.000> great<00:01:00.270> especially

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
leaking out so that's great especially

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
leaking out so that's great especially
if<00:01:00.809> you're<00:01:00.899> traveling<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.859> keep<00:01:02.250> your

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it is a little bit difficult to remove

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.429 
it is a little bit difficult to remove
it<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.570> want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> lose<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> little

guy<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> downfall<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.400> me<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.970> getting<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
guy so a downfall for me is getting the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
guy so a downfall for me is getting the
packaging<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.710> messy<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
packaging a little bit messy because I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300 
packaging a little bit messy because I
don't<00:01:14.790> keep<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.509> plug<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
don't keep the little plug on there the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
don't keep the little plug on there the
nozzle<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.820> open<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> sometimes<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
nozzle is open and sometimes the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
nozzle is open and sometimes the
leftover<00:01:19.470> foundation<00:01:20.009> I'll<00:01:20.250> find<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.880> when

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
leftover foundation I'll find like when

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
leftover foundation I'll find like when
I<00:01:21.060> pick<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.600> I'll<00:01:21.810> find<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> I'll<00:01:22.290> see

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
I pick this up I'll find that I'll see

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.410 
I pick this up I'll find that I'll see
like<00:01:23.040> foundation<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.000> around<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> ball

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
like foundation all around the ball

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
like foundation all around the ball
which<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.250> because

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
which for me I don't really like because

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
which for me I don't really like because
I<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> keep<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.330> makeup<00:01:27.540> looking<00:01:27.990> clean

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
I like to keep my makeup looking clean

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
I like to keep my makeup looking clean
and<00:01:28.320> new<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.790> easy<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> clean

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

that I got in my Birchbox I do have to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.399 
that I got in my Birchbox I do have to
get<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> full<00:02:19.420> size<00:02:19.659> of<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:19.959> because<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.200> did

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
get a full size of this because I did

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.679 
get a full size of this because I did
actually<00:02:20.680> really<00:02:21.220> enjoy<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.360> I'm<00:02:25.420> putting

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
actually really enjoy it so I'm putting

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.960 
actually really enjoy it so I'm putting
this<00:02:25.840> mainly<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.829> dry<00:02:27.040> areas<00:02:27.519> like<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.819> my

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
this mainly on the dry areas like on my

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.780 
this mainly on the dry areas like on my
cheeks<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.599> on<00:02:28.659> the<00:02:28.810> chin<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:30.430> what<00:02:30.760> I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
cheeks and on the chin because what I

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.410 
cheeks and on the chin because what I
noticed<00:02:31.269> with<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:33.040> foundation<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:33.909> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
noticed with this foundation is that the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.809 
noticed with this foundation is that the
coverage<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.959> really<00:02:35.349> really<00:02:35.530> nice<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
coverage is really really nice but it

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.210 
coverage is really really nice but it
does<00:02:37.090> tend<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.540> emphasize<00:02:37.829> texture<00:02:38.829> on<00:02:39.040> your

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
does tend to emphasize texture on your

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.460 
does tend to emphasize texture on your
skin<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:39.849> if<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> dry<00:02:40.599> skin<00:02:40.629> if<00:02:41.349> you

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
skin so if you have a dry skin if you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.160 
skin so if you have a dry skin if you
have<00:02:41.500> patchy<00:02:41.920> skin<00:02:42.420> enlarged<00:02:43.420> pores<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> tends

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
have patchy skin enlarged pores it tends

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.750 
have patchy skin enlarged pores it tends
to<00:02:44.430> sometimes<00:02:46.920> make<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.040> very<00:02:48.220> apparent

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
to sometimes make that very apparent

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.879 
to sometimes make that very apparent
which<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:49.450> what<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.049> want<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.829> you

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
which is not what you want so if you

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.710 
which is not what you want so if you
just<00:02:51.129> moisturize<00:02:51.639> really<00:02:51.970> well<00:02:52.150> use<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> good

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
just moisturize really well use a good

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.569 
just moisturize really well use a good
primer<00:02:52.989> then<00:02:53.379> usually<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.859> can<00:02:54.010> avoid<00:02:54.310> that

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
primer then usually you can avoid that

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.490 
primer then usually you can avoid that
I'm<00:02:55.180> also<00:02:55.299> going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.599> put<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.230> bit<00:02:56.379> of

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
it's a very thick foundation you can see

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.420 
it's a very thick foundation you can see
it's<00:03:47.949> not<00:03:48.069> going<00:03:48.129> anywhere

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
it's not going anywhere

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.650 
it's not going anywhere
but<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.699> like<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:52.000> spread<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.419> out<00:03:52.599> a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
but I just like to spread it out a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.199 
but I just like to spread it out a
little<00:03:52.900> bit

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.070 

with<00:03:57.870> my<00:03:58.049> finger

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.750 

so<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.650> spread<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:04.040> out<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.340> I'm<00:04:04.430> going<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.640> go

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
so I spread that out and I'm going to go

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.070 
so I spread that out and I'm going to go
back<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.120> my<00:04:05.240> beauty<00:04:05.480> blender<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.900> just

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.990 

so<00:04:18.480> there<00:04:18.990> is<00:04:19.320> half<00:04:19.800> my<00:04:20.070> face<00:04:20.340> done<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.850> can

through the day my nose will start to

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.480 
through the day my nose will start to
show<00:05:42.720> some<00:05:43.050> oils<00:05:43.410> so<00:05:43.650> at<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.010> point<00:05:44.340> I

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
show some oils so at that point I

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.160 
show some oils so at that point I
usually<00:05:44.670> take<00:05:45.060> an<00:05:45.210> oil<00:05:45.330> blotting<00:05:45.630> sheet<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.110> I
