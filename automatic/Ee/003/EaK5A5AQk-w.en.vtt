00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in the second test game of the preparation 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 he suggests he stays 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.269
 Regionalligisten goslarer sc with 2 to 0 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.830
 Today, the bulls offensive should be better 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.809
 work as last 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 even if the Lower Saxony currently in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 the Regionalliga nord on place 15 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 overwinter against the second division 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 Leipzig is the blue-white highest 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.359
 motivated to have the first goal chance 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.160
 However, the host news breaks and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 each good demmel come dangerously 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.789
 enemy goal 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 with new entrances emil vossberg want the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.189
 red bulls again more dangerous 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.620
 become 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 but also the guests mostly create 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.399
 successful counter chances 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.829
 just a minute later has captain 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.510
 daniel frahn the gate on the foot yet 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.670
 the keeper is on the spot 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.469
 Also on the other side there are too 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.600
 do for fabio coltorti 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 after half an hour comes again 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.039
 daniel frahn to a dangerous 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 Held header 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.230
 in the 42 minute he succeeds 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.230
 finally the gate daniel ask for one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 to zero for rb if the captain the club 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.970
 leaves is still unclear 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.010
 then half-time new access is more there 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 Marie is watching his new team today 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 from the sideline 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.979
 the break brings us the opportunity 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 Construction site of the training center 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.720
 visit 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.939
 By summer it should be here at 13,500 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.369
 square meters 1 35 million more expensive 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.220
 training pallas with internat 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.590
 for the 600 spectators it will be in the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.509
 second half, but uncomfortable 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.119
 the field is doing a lot 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.759
 chess coach alexander angrily is now setting 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 with neckermann palacios and strauss up 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.070
 the young wild and also changes the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.500
 rest of the team completely missed out on jk 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 with his pass just short tom nattermann it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 stays at 1 0 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.759
 also the free kicks of dominik kaiser 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.860
 Do not lead to success today in the 71st 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.340
 minute he succeeds in bathing two 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.229
 zero 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.180
 you can still do it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.430
 shoot 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.170
 just two minutes later comes too 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.770
 Dominik Kaiser once again dangerous 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.120
 in front of goal 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.430
 he warps and then we are finished 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.229
 We are satisfied with the results 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.090
 just wanted to present us well and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.280
 We did that and we did too 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.500
 had some chances first half i 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 believe second too unfortunately we have 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.700
 No gates but we are in 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.300
 preparation and will be easy 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 work and always improve the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.180
 defensive but already some things too 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.410
 classes you normally leave 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.000
 I think so a mixture 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.570
 this possibility and then this 433 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.010
 owed where you have been so far 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.560
 want to vary the height 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.080
 that does not fit if the player with the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.760
 first ball already have the feeling now 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.620
 now classify silos then they do themselves 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.850
 a bit hard the situation out 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.610
 to find that was mainly in the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.780
 first half to the 2 0 a bit 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.560
 better forward good things here 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.140
 but be muddy that some some 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.730
 positions only in 4-3-1-2 and we 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.040
 have clear the goslar have right 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.120
 good game showed us some before 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.610
 problems 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.590
 I can only do it for the second half now 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.440
 judge as you have the year 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 two three high-profile opportunities 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.930
 worked out and there you have to 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 be more vigilant and easier to handle 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.840
 sure the power a bit then 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.480
 just missing the end behind 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.069
 midterms 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.840
 overall I think yes it is a 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.180
 friendly match we won 2 0 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.910
 It was fun the first time here 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.769
 of course I had to play the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.540
 players and the environment still get to know 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.030
 but I think that was a good start 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.709
 and it will surely be even better use of 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.480
 poulsen is happy with the first one 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.319
 use of de-mail forsberg 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.709
 I feel good about any post 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.519
 over was played really well today found 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.100
 I consider that it's his first 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.160
 Game is and knows almost no one had 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.500
 completed three trainings and so on 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.019
 yes, I am glad that you have him too 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.950
 Play Forsberg defines his goal 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.030
 clearly 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.030
 Bundesliga on course 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.260
 plain bundesliga that's so good
