00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 hello my dear viewer and today 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.160
 fight on sherman m4 with a landfill fight on 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 masters the most interesting thing is that in principle 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.939
 my goal was not set to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.099
 you roll there take the master there is no contrary 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.309
 actually and gold here is charged 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.650
 me for this reason the whole point is that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.530
 Now the action is triple crew experience for 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.839
 what's a simple enough fight there 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 Of course bulbs commander and in general 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.580
 the whole crew is swinging at turbo speed 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.400
 Well, I did not fail to take advantage of this 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.229
 here I am charging an opportunity here 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.170
 just in the top getting why exactly 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.059
 Now I want to explain I wanted to go to the field where 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.430
 there allies poked but no one went there 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.269
 I went I decided that one in the field is not a warrior and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.780
 I decided that this is too much for me, it 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.979
 superfluous , let's say this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.580
 Golda on Sherman 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.940
 one problem 100 one 101 millimeters 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.540
 breaking 101 points I wanted to say funny 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.450
 why yes that's the point is that the gold 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.610
 punch we punch far not all 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.800
 if i get into the sixes i charge 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.630
 landmine and because there is at least some 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.870
 damage can be caused by a bomb, even without 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 breaking damage dealt a lot all gimme 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.110
 only in the case of penetration but immediately a lot 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 but immediately 300 350 points of strength here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 now apt-1 shoot it practically 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 it is unrealistic to pierce it as if even 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.920
 when he stands sideways rarely 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 it makes its way but although here here too 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.070
 this situation is worth the big one 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 killed 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.600
 just like a sea battle is very nice 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 ride to hand out vanshots on this machine 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.430
 but sometimes there are some difficulties 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 still arise with a breakthrough say 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.720
 Thirty-four have to aim 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.660
 while I target allies and slammed 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.700
 again the gold shell went by 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.980
 cool hurts can afford 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 fakes when it comes to pumping 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.710
 crew here already skimp on silver 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 there is no sense here is the fight itself 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.930
 continues 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.210
 we even got something in there pretty well 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.930
 everything seems fine i got it there 1 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.190
 dunce 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.640
 here the firefly pops up and by the way 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.040
 Yes 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.240
 from the land mine to get on the moving target 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.210
 from afar well this is not an easy task 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.910
 getting of course but not always 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.280
 it is far from always very difficult 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 do i have to shoot with big 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 by anticipation before the goal to the ground exactly 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.320
 where should he drive now 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.500
 something like an artillery shot 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.960
 approximately also here I am charging the miner 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.270
 because the fireflies hunt a mustache 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.520
 land mines especially as son bombs 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.480
 fireflies, too, punching there in my 53 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.340
 breakthrough units pretty good here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.010
 and if they have a margin of safety even to that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.040
 the same small generally healthy look 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.800
 attention what happened I just hung 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.110
 sometimes it happens but i sin on fashion and 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.170
 when i rewrote the game and drew 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.970
 attention that I am still alive, even apart 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.430
 everything else we take a base and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.470
 the numerical advantage is already gone 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.060
 I charge gold shell because I do not 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.450
 I know who at the base is worth guessing 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.010
 then drying well, you never know 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.350
 firefly must be removed because it is not 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.989
 Do not give to rest, and by the way, remember too 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.690
 blue shoot that's git okay okay 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.060
 can you do what is there gold arrows 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.590
 nothing can be done 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.130
 I understand now that there will be a seizure 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.440
 base and urgently need urgent light 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.260
 rival because i'm here in a very 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.450
 unpleasant situations I can be 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.540
 my knocked down I also miss the additives 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.860
 I understand that here we are not talking about 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.490
 survive of there at least 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.550
 kill he killed oh all capture captured all 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.530
 cool true i was left completely without 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.620
 points of strength but we even got 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.510
 some small numerical advantage 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.250
 healthy and healthy and it happens 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.109
 Yes, we have exchanged drying here 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.990
 impartial expressions there 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.780
 In principle, this sometimes happens but I 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.060
 I don't really like when they start me there 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.640
 there you can troll or call me 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.510
 do not hesitate to answer the same thing 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.380
 first started in principle here it happens 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.280
 okay we go further I see that in principle 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.400
 here except me will drag anyone well 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.610
 there is there in 1 there is someone else there 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.680
 two arts but something I hope for them 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.360
 I do not particularly want from such 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 maneuverable mobile tanks i 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.830
 the only one here who can 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.390
 do and basically have to do 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.419
 among other things, I have a good 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.820
 Review on Sherman in my 370 meters 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.120
 if I am not mistaken 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.790
 Here comes the beautiful vanshot 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.669
 the enemy of this we punch in the board without 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.190
 all sorts of problems a hundred one millimeter and here 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.550
 enough but well beyond 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.400
 will start a more interesting thing golda then 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.750
 ends i carry with me only 13 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.180
 gold shells don't even know why 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.130
 just such a number can just itself 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.120
 number like maybe no you don't know 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.910
 Well, as it turned out that if all 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.430
 shoot and I 'll do it now I 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.580
 I leave in the minus is not very big at 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:45.330
 Winning with a defeat certainly not very 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.290
 nice here punching like 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.479
 seems to be of every rival but after 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.180
 after i punched him i drive closer 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.550
 and he starts tossing and turning, I understand that 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.050
 This bot is the last gold shell 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.930
 I release in the mouth and what I hear 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.210
 I did n't break through I didn't break through with gold 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.810
 but it was a blower that should have broken higher 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.039
 aims as though I did not expect a break through 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.350
 I do not have enough art 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.229
 but sometimes this happens nothing 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.990
 can you do that ? 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.169
 one major opponent is q-1 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.270
 we canâ€™t do anything with gold 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.220
 on their own gold no longer left 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.020
 only land mines 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.699
 if landing out of it can knock there 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.130
 be a little bit more if he comes 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.440
 free we must do to him there 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:39.039
 four five shots to bang him 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.690
 and it is very, very sad I think that 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.340
 he doesn't scatter faster yes what am I 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.430
 scatter horns from me 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.000
 yes legs I'm thinking here maybe 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.639
 are taught somewhere here but no art is here 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.009
 because as if she were there she would 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.830
 I would have already thrown kills our 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.050
 ally kills kv-1 here's a grill 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.440
 I think I should be needed now 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.599
 here's a bang and everything will be great but there were 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.300
 on landmine to this such a miracle she but she 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.550
 such a scythe I'm crazy to do 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.440
 cant stop waiting for now 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.590
 the horns turn on again I see 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.720
 grilling well, and then no longer miss 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.870
 all that's left to do is take 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.389
 base because shoot from apt-1 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.990
 but I really do not feel like it 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:28.419
 will lead to understandable consequences here 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:32.050
 hiding behind the house I believe that he should 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:34.180
 come by water but it turns out that he 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.520
 I'm almost under his nose but he 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.740
 just stupidly I donâ€™t have time 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.259
 I think what to do, I see it there 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.449
 being aggravated on art is distracted but just 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:46.330
 getting behind the house just don't let him 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.970
 time for us to capture the base even if 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.919
 he spat on art and would want me here 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.229
 destroy it did not work 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:55.360
 but actually the whole fight is not like that 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.639
 remarkable were more interesting fight 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.250
 for this fight turned out to be such a master 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:01.509
 Well, on this all subscribe to 

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.139
 channel put likes 

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:07.810
 there are still all sorts of different 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:10.020
 interesting videos yet 

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.020
 until
