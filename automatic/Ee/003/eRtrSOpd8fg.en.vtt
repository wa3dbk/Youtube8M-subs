00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.860
 We are not at the state of Volkswagen at the Volkswagen Motor Show is still 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.700
 always the largest and most sold car brand in Belgium and weighed 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.959
 heavier is introduced by the better 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.009
 There are a few questions to the Czech Republic 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.949
 lows car 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.689
 this and yesterday came out with a second mortgage on the year 2007 which is one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.230
 good year I have also not in the car 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.400
 But what was a bit striking is that the market share that you just see is not 20 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.029
 percent have achieved how is how come that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.059
 it was indeed getting a record even with more than 120,000 cars 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.460
 delivered 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.090
 and therefore perfectly arranged 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.590
 This dropped below 20 percent among the 20 percent and had one indeed 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 per cent 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.460
 indeed we never felt like it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 fantastic and makes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.900
 the height in the second set 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.960
 the second semester sector semester in the field of in scheveningen 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.950
 and the factories and especially with women who have not been able to do this tour there 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.740
 follow with stones and 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.310
 to go ahead 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.970
 What also stood out in July after reports that it was that you got it 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.620
 2008 a bit pessimistic and you expect the market to shrink 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 with 6 percent 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940
 why is that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.450
 hln update 2 we think ours the first one semester once they are good 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.720
 Westergaard and the industry has to approve 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.340
 secondly we have a salon so that always gives that as 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.830
 they in a positive effect 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.000
 but what will happen after the month of june we have a clock single 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.610
 the weak points for us I think of this tournament to travel 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.250
 I am thinking of calling the political problems is an American crisis 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.770
 inflation so people point again does not work because 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.490
 This will tell us that it is all about the environment that is a sign that the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.820
 choice for a red car sectors actually 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.150
 what has it not save with its brand a specific area still to offer 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 environmentally friendly cars 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.300
 we can only have one for our people, which is more environmentally friendly 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.780
 are like the others 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 I do think so 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 for example, here you have a polo blue motion 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:21.599
 we will not watch with five places and editor less than you are not 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.270
 more times 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.290
 ramsay govern emissions 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 that winning there is a very good figure 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.680
 furthermore points out that with the other products about 70 percent higher the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.969
 passage to the passat is also in the neighbors motion 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.149
 come to the line 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.799
 the rare cloudburst 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.769
 less than speech 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.519
 Amsterdam emissions 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.799
 the and so also at the podium when scored so we have something to arrange
