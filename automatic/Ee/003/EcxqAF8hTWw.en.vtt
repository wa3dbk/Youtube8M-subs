00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 Complutense University of Madrid 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 noon on Saturday, January 31 this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.780
 transfer of nurses in search of a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.760
 place to study a specialty 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.810
 repeated in 20 other Spanish provinces 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.510
 in total 16 thousand nurses 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.789
 compete in this exam to fill the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 959 places called 35 percent 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 of the places accredited by the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.820
 autonomous communities are not called 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.830
 I think we are very well prepared 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.519
 because we have been studying 10 hours 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.620
 12 then a lot of discipline perseverance 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.260
 and leave many things aside 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 sacrifice yes and I do yes I have 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 hope 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.389
 the good thing is to go with positivism and know 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.489
 that you're going to take it out and that's it 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:49.920
 I tried it last year and this is a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.510
 second year and it takes more or less of that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.219
 time now I the wta think that as 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.449
 goal or goal simply I come to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.459
 be the best possible, whatever it is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.679
 It will be after many days of study 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:00.659
 effort and dedication comes the time 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.609
 the truth is to leave the nerves 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.489
 back and focus on a marathon runner 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.840
 exam of 200 questions and 4 hours and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 average duration 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.090
 without many nerves just approve 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.360
 already done is studied and simply 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.620
 be calm and do your best 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.660
 it seems complicated to me also because there 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.090
 many questions that although you the strains 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.350
 of memory you have to give it many 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 turns and think a lot and to the best 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 even if you do not know well, do not consider taking out 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.680
 the bet is not good because if I have the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.350
 possibility of the truth that neither 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.820
 study a lot is an exam is an exam 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 very difficult to which you have to dedicate 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 a lot of time and I did not have time to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.700
 dedicate it the truth 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.940
 we come hard to see if we are not going to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 give away no goal but the first 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.540
 the second for the vast majority of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.090
 aspiring nurses 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.640
 specialist pass the cut assumes 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.650
 entry two years of work and half 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 term the best work alternative of 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.690
 future although they miss a greater 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.180
 number of places and specialties 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.140
 as the development of them to see 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 if now with the theme of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.130
 specialties more and more people 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 who wants to do specialty to see if 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 they value us a little more as 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.860
 specialists and I really think that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 should increase the number of places 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 and regulate this a bit 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 specialty is to increase the number of 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 specialties is very important in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.580
 nursing should also get more 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.500
 places and as a profession should 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.080
 recognize yourself much more I see that there 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.670
 much demand and little work simply 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.530
 I see that we are going a little bit towards 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 back because then there are no oppositions 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.250
 for specialties only for 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.320
 Midwife and well, we are in the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.640
 mines very little squares and that but 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.620
 good as now the thing is so bad 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.620
 Well here in Spain is what we have 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.720
 to study and in a specialty I 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.830
 I think that in the future we will end up as the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.709
 mine that of specialists or not and thus it will be 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.510
 a breakthrough I believe the next 27 of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.900
 February the results will be published 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.900
 provisional
