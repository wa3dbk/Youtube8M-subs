00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
at Harvard a Danish scientist Lena how

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.130 
at Harvard a Danish scientist Lena how
had<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.190> idea<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.819> using<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.270> condensate<00:00:06.899> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
had the idea of using a condensate to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.310 
had the idea of using a condensate to
slow<00:00:07.470> down<00:00:07.710> light<00:00:11.360> we<00:00:12.360> all<00:00:12.570> have<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.019> sense

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
slow down light we all have this sense

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.550 
slow down light we all have this sense
you<00:00:13.650> know<00:00:13.769> light<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.429> something<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.560> nothing

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
you know light is something that nothing

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.990 
you know light is something that nothing
goes<00:00:16.710> faster<00:00:17.130> than<00:00:17.160> light<00:00:17.960> in<00:00:18.960> vacuum<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.310> if

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
goes faster than light in vacuum and if

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.269 
goes faster than light in vacuum and if
somehow<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.810> could<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> system<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.100> get

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
somehow we could use a system to get

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.670 
somehow we could use a system to get
light<00:00:23.609> down<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.779> added<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> human

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
light down to you know added to a human

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.099 
light down to you know added to a human
level<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.220> thought<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.910> was<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.109> absolutely

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
level I thought that was just absolutely

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.790 
level I thought that was just absolutely
fascinating

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.459 

Lena<00:00:36.800> how<00:00:37.160> created<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.940> cigar-shaped

bose-einstein condensate to carry out
her<00:00:41.449> experiment<00:00:42.220> she<00:00:43.220> fired<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.640> light<00:00:43.850> pulse

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
her experiment she fired a light pulse

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.810 
her experiment she fired a light pulse
into<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.570> cloud<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:46.040> speed<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.489> light<00:00:46.670> is

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
into the cloud the speed of light is

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.380 
into the cloud the speed of light is
around<00:00:47.829> 186,000<00:00:48.829> miles<00:00:49.010> per<00:00:49.190> second<00:00:49.699> but<00:00:50.239> when

around 186,000 miles per second but when
the<00:00:50.510> pulse<00:00:50.690> hits<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.260> condensate<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.100> slows

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
the pulse hits the condensate it slows

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.290 
the pulse hits the condensate it slows
down<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.659> speed<00:00:54.019> of<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.379> bicycle<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:56.120> light

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
down to the speed of a bicycle so light

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.810 
down to the speed of a bicycle so light
pulse<00:00:56.600> might<00:00:56.809> start<00:00:57.110> out<00:00:57.230> being<00:00:57.800> 1<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.339> 2<00:00:58.550> miles

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
pulse might start out being 1 to 2 miles

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.759

long<00:00:58.970> in<00:00:59.300> free<00:00:59.479> space<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.079> goes<00:01:00.320> into<00:01:00.559> our

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
long in free space it goes into our

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
first that will slow down the packets is

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.139 
first that will slow down the packets is
still<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.710> free<00:01:06.890> space<00:01:07.159> I'll<00:01:07.429> catch<00:01:07.729> up<00:01:07.759> and

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
still in free space I'll catch up and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.130 
still in free space I'll catch up and
then<00:01:08.690> create<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:10.420> compression<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.570> it'll

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
then create that compression and it'll

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.440 
then create that compression and it'll
end<00:01:12.259> up<00:01:12.470> being<00:01:12.789> compressed<00:01:13.789> from<00:01:14.030> 1<00:01:14.179> to<00:01:14.270> 2

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
end up being compressed from 1 to 2

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
end up being compressed from 1 to 2
miles<00:01:14.660> down<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:16.479> 0.001<00:01:17.479> micron<00:01:18.020> or<00:01:18.200> even

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
miles down to 0.001 micron or even

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.790 
miles down to 0.001 micron or even
smaller<00:01:18.770> than<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:19.899> you<00:01:20.899> could<00:01:21.050> say<00:01:21.229> well<00:01:21.500> T

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
smaller than that you could say well T

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.650 
smaller than that you could say well T
is<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.490> stop<00:01:22.700> light<00:01:22.940> because<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.360> could<00:01:23.479> just

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
is to stop light because I could just

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.600 
is to stop light because I could just
add<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> laser<00:01:24.050> beam<00:01:24.320> into<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.679> wall<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.460> would

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
add a laser beam into a wall and I would

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.560 
add a laser beam into a wall and I would
stop<00:01:25.850> it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.970 

well<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> problem<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.740> lose<00:01:30.920> the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
well the problem is you lose the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.950 
well the problem is you lose the
information<00:01:31.700> because<00:01:32.030> it's<00:01:32.210> an<00:01:32.480> Enzo<00:01:32.750> heat

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
information because it's an Enzo heat

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.360 
information because it's an Enzo heat
you<00:01:33.050> can<00:01:33.200> navigate<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.650> information<00:01:34.190> back

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
you can navigate that information back

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.270 
you can navigate that information back
in<00:01:35.150> our<00:01:35.360> case<00:01:35.740> when<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:36.860> start<00:01:37.160> with

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
in our case when we start with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.040 
in our case when we start with
information<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:37.910> not<00:01:38.030> lost<00:01:38.330> because<00:01:38.600> that's

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
information is not lost because that's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.260 
information is not lost because that's
stored<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.040> medium<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.730> then<00:01:40.940> one<00:01:41.120> we're

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
stored in the medium and then one we're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.390 
stored in the medium and then one we're
time<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.690> revive<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.740> system<00:01:43.070> has<00:01:43.250> all

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
time to revive it the system has all

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.070 
time to revive it the system has all
information<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.210> revive<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.630> light<00:01:44.780> parts

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
information to revive the light parts

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.649 
information to revive the light parts
and<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.260> can<00:01:45.410> move<00:01:45.530> on

right<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.400> mean<00:02:24.670> we<00:02:24.879> actually<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.750> take<00:02:26.260> atoms

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
right I mean we actually can take atoms

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.740 
right I mean we actually can take atoms
and<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.430> ask<00:02:27.610> them<00:02:27.790> nicely<00:02:27.940> they'll

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
and if we ask them nicely they'll

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.110 
and if we ask them nicely they'll
compute<00:02:29.230> that's<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.769> lot<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.040> fun<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.489> mean<00:02:30.790> have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
compute that's a lot of fun I mean have

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880 
compute that's a lot of fun I mean have
you<00:02:31.209> ever<00:02:31.239> talked<00:02:31.629> to<00:02:31.720> an<00:02:31.870> atom<00:02:32.080> recently<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
you ever talked to an atom recently and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.240 
you ever talked to an atom recently and
how<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.129> talk<00:02:33.400> back<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.239> great<00:02:34.510> yes<00:02:35.250> unlike

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
how to talk back it's great yes unlike

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.819 
how to talk back it's great yes unlike

the same but quantum mechanics is weird
it's<00:02:54.340> funky<00:02:55.030> ok<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:56.109> weird<00:02:58.260> when<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.410> do

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it's funky ok it's weird when you do

weirdness work for you so now let's look

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.910 
weirdness work for you so now let's look
at<00:03:03.549> our<00:03:03.609> quantum<00:03:04.209> bit<00:03:04.390> or<00:03:04.510> qubit<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.530> qubit

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
at our quantum bit or qubit the qubit

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.089 
at our quantum bit or qubit the qubit
can<00:03:06.129> not<00:03:06.670> only<00:03:06.849> be<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> 0<00:03:07.540> or<00:03:07.750> 1<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.379> also<00:03:08.799> both

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
can not only be a 0 or 1 and also both

can not only be a 0 or 1 and also both
the<00:03:09.160> 0<00:03:09.730> &amp;<00:03:10.030> 1<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.230> same<00:03:11.470> high<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:13.030> almost

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
the 0 &amp; 1 as the same high it's almost

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.479 
the 0 &amp; 1 as the same high it's almost
like<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> formal<00:03:14.290> condemnation<00:03:14.560> world<00:03:15.190> at<00:03:15.400> an

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
does this one process is that so you get

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.659 
does this one process is that so you get
