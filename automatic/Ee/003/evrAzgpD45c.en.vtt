would be from this angle we got a nice

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
would be from this angle we got a nice
oval<00:01:08.010> start<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> face

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.650 
now we've got tusks on this guy because
again<00:02:25.910> he's<00:02:26.150> an<00:02:26.270> African<00:02:26.630> elephant<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:29.239> also

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
again he's an African elephant and also

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.880 
again he's an African elephant and also
in<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.840> angle<00:02:30.170> we're<00:02:30.319> not<00:02:30.440> gonna<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.650> able<00:02:30.680> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
in this angle we're not gonna be able to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.339 
in this angle we're not gonna be able to
see<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:32.239> mouth<00:02:32.450> very<00:02:32.750> well<00:02:32.989> it's<00:02:33.200> very

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
see the mouth very well it's very

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.809 
see the mouth very well it's very
difficult<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.800> see<00:02:33.950> basically<00:02:34.250> they<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
difficult to see basically they have to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.339 
difficult to see basically they have to
have<00:02:34.910> their<00:02:35.060> trunks<00:02:35.390> raised<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:35.810> order<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.170> see

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
have their trunks raised in order to see

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.650 
have their trunks raised in order to see
an<00:02:36.739> elephant's<00:02:37.520> mouth<00:02:40.180> photo<00:02:41.180> source<00:02:41.450> I'm

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
an elephant's mouth photo source I'm

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.660 
an elephant's mouth photo source I'm
using<00:02:41.989> has<00:02:45.310> his<00:02:46.310> trunk<00:02:47.270> curled<00:02:47.720> under<00:02:48.670> which

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
using has his trunk curled under which

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.100 
using has his trunk curled under which
actually<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.300> easier<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.900> want

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
actually is a little easier if you want

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.009 
actually is a little easier if you want
to<00:02:51.170> start<00:02:51.440> there<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.940> good<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.360> good<00:02:53.750> shot

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
to start there that's a good a good shot

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.330 
to start there that's a good a good shot
to<00:02:54.230> use<00:02:54.440> because<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:56.800> simpler<00:02:57.800> beginning

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
to use because it's a simpler beginning

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.550 
to use because it's a simpler beginning

the<00:03:04.850> nose<00:03:05.150> we're<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.690> get<00:03:05.810> them<00:03:05.900> real

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
the nose we're going to get them real

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.699 
the nose we're going to get them real
basic<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:09.049> see<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> little<00:03:09.380> bit<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.560> that

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
basic here you see a little bit of that

other tusk

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.490 
other tusk
remember<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.290> hourglass<00:03:12.860> shape<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.500> then

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
remember that hourglass shape and then

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.259 
remember that hourglass shape and then
you<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:17.060> nose<00:03:17.269> extending<00:03:17.810> from<00:03:17.930> that

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
you have a the nose extending from that

from there here's where the cartoony

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.840 
from there here's where the cartoony
really<00:03:22.610> differs<00:03:22.940> from<00:03:23.060> realism<00:03:24.610> their<00:03:25.610> legs
