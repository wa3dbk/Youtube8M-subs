00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.990
 for me 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.400
 In Myself 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.390
 hear the youtube girl in this video 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.460
 I will explain what is happening in the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.320
 music industry is very simple 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 I do not know if Latin America also passes this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
 by in spain- we are already cold 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.210
 surely listen to something that you do not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 like in this video by atmosphere 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.410
 recent in turned out to be Latino I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 but music's common sign to go out to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 close is a style of music that has been 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.920
 made order overnight 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.090
 you listen to the lyrics you can discover that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.090
 they make too easy rhymes 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.289
 if not the quantity 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.289
 A) Yes 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 the night of cold 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 pretty but pink 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
 or lately the little variety of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 tumor style no 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.110
 I do not know if you have noticed that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.480
 now the djs of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.370
 of tomorrowland are being made 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.130
 advertising among them to get 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.990
 more fame and get more money as if 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.550
 they were a kind of mafia although good 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.860
 this music is pretty cool but I do not 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.110
 it seems for so much to be done 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.880
 famous millionaire these people know of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 music and I know that if you try hard 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.060
 could do much better if we 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 we put to analyze this style we arrived 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
 to the conclusion that almost all 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.350
 songs that they do are practically 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.350
 same 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.120
 they change a little the melody distort 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.580
 a little the base and ready we have 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 our little one to sell a detail of 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.960
 means for example the application of 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.230
 spotify they have ads that really 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.980
 piss off for example the people better 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.980
 Enrique Iglesias 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.959
 listen to good music and for sale this 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.319
 and for sale and if we analyze it means 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.180
 that all they want is to sell 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.549
 sell music that's not much either 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.340
 the media have the balls to call 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.310
 the artists summarizing the means 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.290
 they want to sell music easy to compose 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.269
 to sell more in less time and win 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.750
 more money there are characters that copy the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.049
 melody and the sound of a song 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.569
 old and has the excuse of saying that 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.739
 it is a remis or 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:55.549
 or a version of your good life indeed 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.549
 building tail I would spend it father 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.310
 it seems very good to me that they compose or that 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.049
 you want to make a remix or a version 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.060
 protests profiting economically in a 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.889
 80 percent and a job that is not 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.870
 yours in the case of the Latin electro in 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.750
 you fix well almost all songs 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.240
 they are the same as with mane, the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.130
 part of the dubstep the rap part and 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.830
 then in the videoclip there are hunks 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.080
 god dancing break to wet panties and 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.610
 You have a bikini for parties in order 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.740
 that we put everything in the same song 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.600
 and now we have another shit destined 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.240
 to succeed you notice too much that what 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.010
 is looking to please the public by 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.350
 I do not know if you have noticed 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.350
 that Latin electro and reggaeton is 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.380
 different the reggaeton has one more base 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.320
 slow and a little bit stronger and good that 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.780
 it's reggaeton as the music looks like 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.160
 you pass you watch the video listen well the 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.160
 letter and put yourself in the situation 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:14.930
 and these people record the lyrics to the first 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.930
 and then they go home to fuck 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.639
 you do not come to me madness and so we 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.099
 we understand while we learn the 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.569
 we raise and love we make another one of 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.940
 this important of the Latin electro 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.150
 choose a Spaniard who puts a false voice 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:45.500
 and put a thousand effects on the voice so that 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:45.500
 actually conceal so much god's hand 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:59.490
 and then there is a part of the dubstep of 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.490
 hype box now you are looking for me 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.050
 the love that is day 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.470
 what exists and now I tell you I go 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.650
 provided incite to prattle but eye here 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.960
 the letter she is a beast wants sex 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.880
 you have at the time it was recommended because 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.210
 It is a beast although it improves that it is pulled 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.210
 anyone is better than the quixote 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.990
 to see to see we went to what time this 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.610
 plane has many messages here we see 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.870
 The typical one here is subject to Cuba 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.690
 you are consuming alcohol 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.310
 and encourages consumption and the 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.570
 typical superficial aunt 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.200
 this is the fashion that you see now 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.360
 party 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.600
 excuse me if I'm giving a picture of 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.550
 bitter or something like that is not that the music 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.800
 it's important to me and people are 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.110
 killing 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.530
 the music that is created now is so bad 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.840
 that goes from one year to another in 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.370
 the description of the video I leave the 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.889
 name of some channels are those that 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.289
 I'm subscribed to listen to music 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.389
 new so you define a little more 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.770
 your style without the means or 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.039
 they force to cover shit by the ears 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.240
 If I have offended you personally, what 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.669
 I feel 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.410
 the media have deceived you, they erase me 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.180
 the video so good bad luck about 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.150
 all this had to say the conclusion 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.349
 the media want to make us idiots for 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.150
 selling our products is not 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:30.910
 easily and enrich ourselves 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.620
 coast if you stop to analyze already since 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.020
 think what happens around you 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.419
 does not manipulate you would also talk about 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.190
 deal but that is already a matter of fashion and 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.169
 is the subject of which I will return in the 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.410
 next video of good music from 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.410
 football
