00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.160
 and well hello everybody we get 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.809
 found today for a new 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.910
 video about gta 5 in germany 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.990
 finally a little video because I have 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.779
 do not want to see you in the guise 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.490
 right left right it's rather a 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.410
 informative title it's open but it's 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.390
 your crate I like well to note the kind 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.570
 of car even though it's the right had 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.650
 also not bad at all but roughly 20 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.580
 turn a little bit in circles and I'll 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.380
 explain what's going to happen so 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.699
 whose title there will be everything said but 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.620
 play I will explain how I 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.290
 process is there will be others 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.059
 and that's of course I'm talking about sorting to 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.019
 the time when I speak to you I say beret 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.360
 about 340 seats on the crew side by 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.830
 the first fangs I'm only going 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.949
 I'm going to do 400 places when 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.659
 even on this one there why not on 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.299
 two because in fact I realized 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.960
 account only on the two wheels cauty 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.690
 crocodiles 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.769
 there are at least 50 people or 100 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.960
 people I have not finished yet 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.309
 it remains I am at the letter s so 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.920
 this is for you why not 8 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.299
 look later pro you will excuse me game 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.570
 crush them a bit like a shit 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.040
 let's read it like that but here it is 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.450
 maybe 50 or 100 people 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280
 for the moment that they were in the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 two wheels and yet I had asked 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 please what is the point of being in 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.380
 two shots 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.579
 you're in a hole 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.600
 be happy but it's the place for 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:19.929
 the others but not people they are 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.750
 fuck 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.770
 1 he prefers to take care of them a place 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.250
 in each wheel because they are 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.679
 selfish 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.689
 so they were banished from crewe 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.689
 because yes for me it's punishment 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.780
 do not have to lie either so about 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.850
 400 lottery spots on the spot when he 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.770
 will be done a little later surely 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.750
 after the gamescom that takes place 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.740
 soon and I hit it a little bit 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.359
 same system because here I'm doing a 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.159
 parent really one by one like nobody 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.630
 it's not a game says hey I 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.250
 turn randomly, I do not like 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.750
 too much his nickname of ethics no it's 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 that I go on his account I check 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.860
 how many points he played because 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.149
 the people who have who I swear to you 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.459
 have been there for two games and shine 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.469
 and who did not play online mode 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.509
 so basically it's people who have 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.819
 joins crew and chignon that he even makes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.739
 not so long game so that's the one 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.750
 excavations had spotted his life europe 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.399
 rsiq had a lot of foreigners who did not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 did not speak French said to see they 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.480
 spoke Portuguese etc. 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.489
 it's not against them but hey I prefer 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.870
 give a little preference to subscribers 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.549
 francophones because I was seeing there 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.049
 seeing that they post their twitter or full 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.260
 of things and especially if he was also 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.700
 not very active I clicked that I 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.139
 also that there were people who had 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.940
 glitch and relative to the levels 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.170
 I said money after, that is to say 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.120
 know who had cheated or mans because 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.700
 that and quite a lot of problems 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.690
 but a person who is level 200 and 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.760
 who at 10 hours of play 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.900
 excuse me but do not either 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.660
 fout of the mouth of the world I say that a 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.220
 day these people will be fired 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.500
 it's now that I've been able to make a 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.019
 great sort to tell you we are the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.389
 it's July 30 and I started on 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.579
 sort around noon we are there is 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.569
 9.30 pm then you do not have the base I want 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.880
 Corporate posterity is not 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.230
 serious me other I took poses and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.750
 it takes a long time ford and each 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.620
 no one has to check well 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.540
 I also fired the people who were 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.280
 in full crewe but that was not 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.690
 of kif on the coconut tree on the coaticook 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.060
 so I'm paying attention to that too 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.410
 some will say it's not good but 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.030
 as I talked about in the video of 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.709
 races I had talked a little bit about 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.569
 I had just told people what they 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.340
 want to be in the crew and once 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.510
 that they are there they go on another shot 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.040
 for example I do not know about vodka or 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.599
 other cases no problem me it does not 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.190
 not bother but I prefer it clearly 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.930
 left subscribers who are motivated 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.060
 that they are who are hot potato for 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.739
 the crew side to do activities 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.170
 to each other rather than one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.760
 whoever is going to connect by 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.690
 in kotick or only when I'm 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.360
 that's what happens very often 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.410
 that's what I noticed I clicked 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.380
 these people there and the people who 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.150
 who played who played a little bit 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.440
 that they are at level 10 which are 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.000
 of ink or the month of October 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.010
 again I'm sorry we know 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.260
 not against you but what good to keep 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.480
 people in the shot if if one 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.980
 there is even basket is worth 10 frankly 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.170
 to be clean to reach level 10 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.519
 must do it even in one hour of play 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.700
 normally you do not I say 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.580
 race at jo level 10 so I for 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.250
 move on to very normal and and then that's it 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.230
 after I just fired this is the kind 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.250
 in all this will serve about 400 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.130
 people so I may be the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.510
 same thing for the crew coty the brief 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.440
 you understood for the second game 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.820
 it's more like they're called I'm 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.660
 cheat every time because I'm 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.789
 am a little confused in everything 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.630
 that's very simple the link is in the 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.400
 description for everything they 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.169
 ask on the other hand will be no oaktree 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.220
 on this one before at least the end of 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.720
 the year because it's pretty boring to 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.669
 do so I'm not going to have fun doing 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.150
 that every two weeks if you have 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.479
 well understood 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.090
 good luck to those who because what 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.560
 those who want to join game but not 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.770
 as I do not put the possibility of 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.490
 put comments on this video 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.110
 why because people they 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.550
 insult them among them jean louis me 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.600
 I took my place fucked etc you 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.340

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.820
 this to do so I prefer not to leave 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.800

 down have you understood how is it going 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.880
 in fact I'm done a nice half turn 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.870
 and that's so it's simple after too 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.969
 I want to apologize a little bit of 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.559
 absences I have 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.779
 lately it's true that I think that 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.579
 I post a video shot two or three 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.379
 days it's because his holidays there 

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:23.719
 is very hot and frankly I have not 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.249
 aviary motivation frankly I 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.809
 not very low by man the motivation of 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.110
 make videos that someone either 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.879
 videos 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.469
 I do not really have the motivation to hit 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.509
 I'm going to rest and like that I 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.309
 come back 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.479
 they have it like that and for those who 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.499
 want to know the schedule of end of 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.429
 week pretty much what's going to be 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:43.729
 normally tomorrow the discovery of zola 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:47.049

 say tomorrow is Thursday there will be the saq 

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:53.269

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.649
 Friday it will probably be that 

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:57.169
 not sure yet that I'm not going to 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.519
 discovery of sacred of 3 coming out on 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.159
 August 1st so I do not know if it takes 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:03.229
 post friday but I think so 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.519
 in the evening it will be a clash of fact 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.889
 by a subscriber I have not yet turned the 

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:08.449
 video but that would turn out by then 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.119
 Saturday it will be good what the 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.399

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:18.079
 back from racist plans we say that 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.189
 everyone had been asking me for a 

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.879
 little moment so that will be back 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.979
 the same for the trial fusion ok it will be 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.899
 back for the videos of the weekend 1 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.870
 Sunday as usual it will be the 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:30.330
 racing 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.520
 wrong this is the thing that will make me 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.260
 the most fun right now to do in 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.310
 video it really amuses me and that you 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.300
 fun too because you like it 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.650
 especially that at this moment I play rather
