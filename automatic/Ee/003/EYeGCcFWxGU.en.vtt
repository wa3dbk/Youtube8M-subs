00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.000
 New polls on whether President Obama is worse than President Bush in terms of 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.759
 What will turn our award-winning civil liberties men decided but first 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.999
 Supports the comprehensive drawing 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.950
 Now people are still 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.430
 In favor of crawling by a significant margin 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.699
 When the question is asked in this way 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.839
 So you agree with the use of drone to kill people in foreign countries who 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.269
 The government u_s_ say they are terrorists, present and threatening 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.519
 65 percent say we still stand with him 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.099
 19 percent say we oppose 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.320
 Now it is a terrible number 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 This site is in non 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920
 There last week was 83 percent 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 And 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 Which when you pass the issue differently in less than that gets our request 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 It should be Lulu 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.340
 School for Government u_s_ 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.780
 To kill non-citizens who need u_s_ to be 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.080
 Describe 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 One thing when we do the area they were doing would be illegal 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.249
 53 percent say yes 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.779
 And twenty-one percent say no these numbers again now I'm not this encouraging 

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:58.599
 clearly 

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.950
 Overall very bad 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.470
 At least you know the numbers prove that what is 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.970
 This number seems to be on the pitch about three percent only 80 percent 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.330
 A week from now and here's another number that's a bit encouraged 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.550
 Illegal version of the government u_s_ even American citizens who think 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.729
 Is terrorism 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.679
 Check current threat 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.280
 So this is specifically about citizens u_s_ 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 Now all this sudden number last week was 65 percent 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.180
 Is that 44 percent 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.030
 Now thirty percent do not agree 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.520
 So basically say 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.800
 Oh alright 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.820
 Well-informed citizens also say they are terrorists but have been nominated for a waiver 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.320
 The start of the waiver and the Democrats in the agreement means that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.870
 You know we were optimistic that we were a child 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.650
 People ask that what was actually happening was a pull that started 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.400
 I do not think any of these people do not know any but many of them are great 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.510
 The majority of them do not even know about signature strikes in double taps 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.960
 Where right kill the first responders and kill people who do not know 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.570
 That's their right 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.470
 Five at the moment 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.390
 Our question is the attribution of Mama any better than George Bush w_ 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.950
 To strike a balance between civil liberties and national security 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 There are some surprising answers 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.979
 44 percent say better in this balance 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.589
 37 percent say worse 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.969
 Fifteen percent say the same 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.729
 To ease the worst categories for himself 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.209
 It's actually 52 percent of the majority 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.329
 This is all Bahama either worse or the same Bush in civil liberties 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.399
 By the way 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.290
 That's true 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.629
 Now you can make a request that they say 44 percent of the fruit is over 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.559
 torture 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.050
 Now there are some loopholes out there in the Extraordinary Transfer Program 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.379
 But let's give them that right 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.319
 But it is certainly worse than Bush's drone strikes against citizens as u_s_ 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.379
 And other tracking drugs I just mentioned 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.579
 It is toss-up in some part and here the numbers do not always look like but 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.979
 To encourage me 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.909
 Although the Obama administration passed did not improve under record bushes 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.449
 21 percent of Democrats support the 20 percent three-state liberal 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.379
 So we're talking about 20-25 percent obviously 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.769
 Of the people on progressive liberal Democrats our side is in fact 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.499
 Descriptions say 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:13.769
 You know what 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.199
 In spite of all but I was doing it 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.059
 I'm not a supporter of him 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.489
 I think I will blow up was worse than Bush 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.319
 Looks like they might look like a small percentage do not believe me will 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.760
 This number was much smaller 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.389
 Undisputed on Mama 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.239
 It is definitely from last year two years ago 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.219
 So now you will at least wake up 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.970
 Anywhere to 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.899
 Between you you know if the quarter is true 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.809
 Of the people of our side will 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.139
 Oh that makes no sense 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.660
 I tell you this number will increase 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.089
 Because the bomb is president 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.429
 Violate our civil liberties 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.279
 Huge size
