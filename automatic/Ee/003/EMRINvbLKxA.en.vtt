00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
would make it easier to shoot so to

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.750 
would make it easier to shoot so to
speak<00:06:21.850> oh<00:06:22.030> god<00:06:22.300> you're<00:06:22.570> gonna<00:06:22.660> shoot<00:06:22.960> I<00:06:26.760> hate

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
those things so much they are if they're

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.760
