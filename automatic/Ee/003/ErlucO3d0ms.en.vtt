00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
tool not a shoe so the Apple should be

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.210 
tool not a shoe so the Apple should be
cut<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.229> want<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.920> elegantly<00:01:59.640> thin

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
cut you want them to be elegantly thin

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.280 
cut you want them to be elegantly thin
but<00:02:00.820> not<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:02.800> skinny<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.190> they<00:02:03.490> flop<00:02:04.000> away<00:02:04.990> so

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
but not so skinny that they flop away so

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.710 
but not so skinny that they flop away so
like<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.370> know<00:02:06.490> what<00:02:06.610> kind<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:07.000> risk

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
like this you know what kind of risk

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.780 
like this you know what kind of risk
keep<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.470> little<00:02:08.740> bit<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.160> weight<00:02:09.550> to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
keep it a little bit of like weight to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.600 
keep it a little bit of like weight to
them<00:02:09.970> yeah<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.570> could<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.620> cut<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.070> yourself

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.380 
forgiving mmm so you could cut them by
hand<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.310> didn't<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.670> apples<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.210> hit

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390

you could mix it all right even if you
were<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.750> do<00:02:28.990> this<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.530> small<00:02:29.710> chunks<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.880> all

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
were to do this in small chunks it's all

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
somehow magically in the other the APIs

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.450 
somehow magically in the other the APIs
seem<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.290> line<00:04:24.500> up<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:24.980> they<00:04:25.130> kind<00:04:25.400> of

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
seem to line up in like they kind of

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
easier than this and what's great is you

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.240 
easier than this and what's great is you
should<00:04:44.330> wait<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.200> cool<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.100> don't

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
should wait for it to cool but you don't

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.520 
should wait for it to cool but you don't
have<00:04:46.400> where<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.940> could<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.360> have<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.720> taste

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
have where you could just have a taste

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.770 
have where you could just have a taste
of<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.830> when<00:04:48.980> it's<00:04:49.100> warm<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.340> that's<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:50.240> we're

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
of it when it's warm so that's it we're

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.700 
of it when it's warm so that's it we're
so<00:04:51.080> now<00:04:51.350> what<00:04:52.190> kind<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:52.900> temperature<00:04:53.900> will<00:04:54.530> we

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
so now what kind of temperature will we

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.490 
so now what kind of temperature will we
need<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:55.070> 400-degree<00:04:55.760> oven<00:04:55.940> for<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.380> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
need a 400-degree oven for this is the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.350 
need a 400-degree oven for this is the
hard<00:04:57.680> part<00:04:57.830> about<00:04:57.980> 40<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.550> 50<00:04:58.670> minutes<00:04:59.120> so<00:04:59.240> it

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
hard part about 40 to 50 minutes so it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.840 
hard part about 40 to 50 minutes so it
really<00:04:59.690> has<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.350> bake<00:05:00.770> through<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.310> what

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
really has to bake through and what

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.670 
really has to bake through and what
you're<00:05:02.120> looking<00:05:02.450> for<00:05:02.840> well<00:05:03.260> you'll<00:05:03.380> see<00:05:03.560> it

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
you're looking for well you'll see it

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.410 
you're looking for well you'll see it
when<00:05:03.770> we<00:05:03.890> look<00:05:04.040> at<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.220> finished<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:04.610> is<00:05:05.030> you

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
when we look at the finished one is you

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.920 
when we look at the finished one is you
want<00:05:05.780> golden<00:05:06.770> brown<00:05:07.010> then<00:05:07.550> baking<00:05:07.930> color

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
want golden brown then baking color

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.030 
want golden brown then baking color
equals<00:05:09.530> flavor

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
equals flavor

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.670 
equals flavor
so<00:05:10.520> wait<00:05:10.790> for<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.240> get<00:05:11.360> brown<00:05:12.050> don't<00:05:12.440> get

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
so wait for it to get brown don't get

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.110 
so wait for it to get brown don't get
