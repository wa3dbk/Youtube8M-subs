Aston Villa we can share the same values
they<00:04:41.159> say<00:04:41.370> way<00:04:41.639> of<00:04:42.240> making<00:04:42.599> business<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.500> a

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
fair way I have to say that I am really

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.929 
fair way I have to say that I am really
proud<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.409> what<00:04:49.409> we<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:49.740> developed<00:04:50.550> for

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
proud of what we have developed for

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.300 
proud of what we have developed for
Aston<00:04:51.240> Villa<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.659> I<00:04:51.780> think<00:04:52.050> that<00:04:52.229> we<00:04:53.129> have

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
Aston Villa and I think that we have

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.670 
Aston Villa and I think that we have
meat<00:04:53.639> no<00:04:53.969> Aston<00:04:54.449> Villa<00:04:54.629> people<00:04:54.960> expectations

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
meat no Aston Villa people expectations

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.490 
meat no Aston Villa people expectations
in<00:04:55.919> terms<00:04:55.949> of<00:04:56.520> stars<00:04:56.939> quality<00:04:57.629> design<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.319> so

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
in terms of stars quality design and so

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.369 
in terms of stars quality design and so
on<00:04:58.560> okay<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.069> of<00:04:59.879> course<00:04:59.939> now<00:05:00.360> we<00:05:00.419> have<00:05:00.750> worked

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
on okay and of course now we have worked

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.369 
on okay and of course now we have worked
with<00:05:01.529> them<00:05:01.770> for<00:05:01.800> many<00:05:02.069> months<00:05:02.460> but<00:05:03.449> I<00:05:04.020> think

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
with them for many months but I think

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.070 
with them for many months but I think
that<00:05:04.620> not<00:05:05.129> be<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:06.060> result<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.810> we<00:05:06.990> have

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
that not be the result that we have

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.869 
that not be the result that we have
achieved<00:05:07.169> all<00:05:07.680> together<00:05:07.860> is<00:05:08.370> something<00:05:08.550> that

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
achieved all together is something that

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.230 
achieved all together is something that
from<00:05:09.599> our<00:05:09.779> point<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.319> view<00:05:10.379> is<00:05:10.650> really<00:05:11.240> spatial

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
from our point of view is really spatial

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.140 
from our point of view is really spatial
is<00:05:12.449> really<00:05:12.840> unique<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.740> hope<00:05:13.979> that<00:05:14.310> we<00:05:14.969> can

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
is really unique so I hope that we can

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.640 
is really unique so I hope that we can
meet<00:05:15.419> let's<00:05:15.779> say<00:05:15.900> Aston<00:05:16.199> Villa<00:05:16.379> funds

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
meet let's say Aston Villa funds

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.790 
meet let's say Aston Villa funds
expectation<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:17.699> but<00:05:18.629> they<00:05:19.289> say<00:05:19.439> that<00:05:19.620> we

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
expectation and but they say that we

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.740 
expectation and but they say that we
have<00:05:19.889> worked<00:05:20.189> very<00:05:20.340> hard<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:21.120> order<00:05:21.360> let's<00:05:21.659> say

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
have worked very hard in order let's say

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:31.210 
have worked very hard in order let's say
to<00:05:21.810> meet<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.379> expectations

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.280
