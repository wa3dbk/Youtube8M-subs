 it's been like my hand brakes but in 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.880
 human version 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.649
 I've seen the third the next point 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 it's down here it seems today today today today 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.770
 today today today today today today 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.259
 It has hit me but good at least 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.259
 my life 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 that puts me that I'm going second and the first 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:55.970
 Where is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:59.789
 the first where this man got 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.479
 and where is this man okay I see this 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.409
 last super away the guy goes to 24 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.930
 second but I think we can 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.520
 pillar 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.320
 I sincerely thought that uncle 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.970
 surely seeing that coming down from beating 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.620
 it's not going to be the little horse and we 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.460
 we are opening the slipstream at the same time 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.310
 we make the little horse and I think that 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.620
 We can catch you sincerely opined 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.620
 well yes I think so 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.620
 power 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.530
 the boys are going to see if I can give 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.250
 we have it out there I 've said it uncle 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.569
 strong basic that the war has had 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.680
 but I still did not have 50 point of 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.410
 control so we have time to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.360
 catch him 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 that many reeds and we want to give 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.910
 truth I say here here we go 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.670
 what did not have to happen good but 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.930
 minus these 16 seconds was 24 so 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.230
 we are cutting away enough distance 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.450
 it go fast to see if this gentleman pilla 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.159
 but also against a stone or something what 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.299
 enough love the typical memory 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.349
 races through the mountains that I from 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.990
 true that the race for the mountain that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.890
 we have done 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.840
 he tried to access the program he quickened 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.660
 too much like I should jump and not 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.880

 for a centimeter of calls see you 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.380
 male super plus the genetic test of 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.880
 true that is whether the race is called the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.490
 race of luck I am totally 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.210
