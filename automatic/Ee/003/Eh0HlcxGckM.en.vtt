00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.199
 hello my name is raul welcome to me 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.199
 channel 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.179
 this is the first video of the channel 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.219
 belonging to the section of 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.680
 half body development I will give a 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.509
 pretty simple idea but not everything 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 the world has assimilated and for that 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.110
 I'll give you some little tips if you're 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.210
 interested in the development of 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.980
 video games will have visited forums and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.080
 they will have verified that there are certain 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.170
 questions that are repeated a lot in the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.780
 different forums and I have an idea for 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.090
 do a mba I have the idea to make a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.040
 shooter 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.020
 the truth is that these people start pretty 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 bad since they tend to be people who do not have 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.150
 programming knowledge and 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.650
 3d design neither of any kind and now 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.989
 we have we have people that 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.090
 thinks it's too complicated and 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.790
 although they would like to not be encouraged because 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.960
 they do not know where to start for everything 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.580
 the one who wants to develop videogames 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.930
 I'm going to give you some advice either 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.090
 either of these two cases or of 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.550
 any other first what you have to 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.440
 to do is to know what part of the development 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.930
 video game you like more programming 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.790
 design of the game design music etc and 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 analyze if really good or you have 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 to learn new things 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.760
 once you have clear another part of the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.800
 development you want to focus on 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.740
 improve that knowledge and 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.530
 perfect your techniques and how to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 perfect very easy reading manuals 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.830
 books and especially practice practicing 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.590
 and more practices the practice in which you 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.000
 You will take to improve the doubts that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.710
 you can leave is for example if you are 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 trainers that you do with the part 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 very simple graphic if you are 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.350
 programmers start using 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.760
 tools that will set you free 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.980
 to develop your yours 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.410
 programming ability but use 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.180
 graphics that already exist in google yes 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.400
 you put spray of any game that you 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.440
 like in 2d because you always have to 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.320
 start with 12 because it's going to simplify 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.730
 the learning and you can use it 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.780
 perfectly to develop our 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.940
 own frame is not going to be a game 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.230
 commercial but it's not the idea that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.569
 the first game you make go to the 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.090
 college 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.549
 If instead what you notice 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.730
 what you want to dedicate is to the 2d design or 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.109
 3d and in 2d you can use tools like 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.579
 game maker that you can match 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.859
 perfectly two-dimensional without 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.870
 know just how to program and if it is in 3d 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.389
 then you can use for example the engine 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.069
 unity 3d that has free version and 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.349
 that if you need some programming 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.240
 there are many scripts that are already made and 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.130
 you can download from the internet 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.920
 all the villages then in two 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.570
 tips the first one is online 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.450
 what part of the development would you like 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.060
 dedicate yourself and the second throw yourself 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.770
 experience testing and as they go 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.910
 coming out the problems try 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.920
 solve them in the least possible way 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.480
 Only then you can go acquiring 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.240
 experiences and being able to develop 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.310
 increasingly complex things 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.220
 the subject of this video has been too 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.080
 simple and obvious but it is true that everything 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.830
 the world has it assimilated by or salt 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.630
 how to start 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.910
 Anyway if you have any questions 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.820
 send me a message or you can leave it 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.590
 here on the same channel or send it to 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.840
 mail that I will try to put in the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.000
 description you can also do 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.230
 any suggestion that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.440
 this one you want them to treat the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.910
 indifferent and this means anyway 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.560
 I'm going to deepen it a lot in the part 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.600
 technique of the development of your body 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.840
 right now the idea is that the people who 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.730
 have doubts and do not know how to start 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.730
 a form of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.010
 will start in this good world already without 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.140
 more I say goodbye if you like the video 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.239
 I like to hope that if I do not 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.400
 you have done yet or subscribe and 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.000
 I hope to see you future future videos 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000
