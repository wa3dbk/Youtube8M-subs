00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
remember one thing one of the major

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710

reasons<00:01:08.100> why<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.700> bought<00:01:09.000> gold<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
reasons why people bought gold in the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
reasons why people bought gold in the
first<00:01:09.930> place<00:01:10.229> many<00:01:10.470> years<00:01:10.560> ago<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
first place many years ago was as a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.179 
first place many years ago was as a
hedge<00:01:12.799> okay<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> hedge<00:01:14.659> against<00:01:15.659> QE

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
hedge okay so as a hedge against QE

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
hedge okay so as a hedge against QE
alright<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:18.630> saying

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
alright but now that if they're saying

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.390 
alright but now that if they're saying
and<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.619> serious<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and if there really are serious but the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
and if there really are serious but the
whole<00:01:20.549> idea<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.110> slowing<00:01:22.110> down<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.439> even

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
whole idea of slowing down or even

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.910 
whole idea of slowing down or even
ending<00:01:23.070> QE<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.299> certainly<00:01:25.049> spells<00:01:25.409> bad<00:01:25.650> news

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
ending QE that certainly spells bad news

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920

speculating<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.430> gold<00:01:53.820> market<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
speculating that the gold market is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510 
speculating that the gold market is
gonna<00:01:54.509> go<00:01:54.689> even<00:01:54.930> lower<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:56.040> may<00:01:56.159> happen

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
gonna go even lower now that may happen

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.830 
gonna go even lower now that may happen
but<00:01:56.610> there's<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:56.969> thing<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.540> about<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
but there's one thing we know about the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
but there's one thing we know about the
market<00:01:58.079> through<00:01:58.380> experience<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.219> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
market through experience which is this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
market through experience which is this
which<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> markets<00:02:00.899> always<00:02:01.380> tend<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
which is that markets always tend to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
which is that markets always tend to
surprise<00:02:02.159> us<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.520> always<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> opposite

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
surprise us they always do the opposite

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.539 
surprise us they always do the opposite
what<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.930> expect<00:02:04.290> them<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.340> really

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
what we expect them to and the really

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.310 
what we expect them to and the really
interesting<00:02:05.579> question<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.420> why<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.990> goal

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
interesting question is why is it a goal

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.889 
interesting question is why is it a goal
did<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.890> sell<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.700> news<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> QE<00:02:09.479> may

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
did not sell off on this news the QE may

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
did not sell off on this news the QE may
slow<00:02:10.140> down<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:10.530> end<00:02:10.950> by<00:02:11.250> Christmas<00:02:11.730> now

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
slow down or even end by Christmas now

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.559 
slow down or even end by Christmas now
my<00:02:13.020> personal

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
my personal

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.259 
my personal
belief<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.019> this<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.469> that<00:02:14.709> if<00:02:14.920> indeed<00:02:15.249> QE<00:02:15.640> is

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
belief on this is that if indeed QE is

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.259 
belief on this is that if indeed QE is
going<00:02:16.749> to<00:02:16.840> be<00:02:16.900> slowed<00:02:17.200> down<00:02:17.230> or<00:02:17.650> end<00:02:18.269> either

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
going to be slowed down or end either

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.869 
going to be slowed down or end either
it's<00:02:19.540> because<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.439> market<00:02:21.099> participants<00:02:21.639> or

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
it's because that market participants or

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.550 
it's because that market participants or
investors<00:02:22.269> are<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.629> not<00:02:22.870> believing<00:02:23.439> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
investors are really not believing the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.069 
investors are really not believing the
Fed<00:02:23.829> because<00:02:24.700> sometimes<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.389> Fed<00:02:25.599> says<00:02:25.900> one

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
Fed because sometimes the Fed says one

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.869 
Fed because sometimes the Fed says one
thing<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.469> there's<00:02:26.650> another<00:02:26.829> there<00:02:27.639> actually

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
thing but there's another there actually

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.280 
thing but there's another there actually
could<00:02:27.909> be<00:02:28.120> another<00:02:28.420> reason<00:02:28.810> probably<00:02:29.079> a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
could be another reason probably a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.670 
could be another reason probably a
better<00:02:29.499> reason<00:02:29.709> which<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.159> that<00:02:31.120> if<00:02:31.510> indeed<00:02:31.989> QE

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
better reason which is that if indeed QE

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.599 
better reason which is that if indeed QE
is<00:02:32.920> gonna<00:02:33.099> end

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
is gonna end

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.569 
is gonna end
that<00:02:34.030> means<00:02:34.239> bonds<00:02:34.810> are<00:02:34.930> gonna<00:02:35.170> collapse<00:02:35.739> I'm

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
that means bonds are gonna collapse I'm

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.780 
that means bonds are gonna collapse I'm
just<00:02:36.760> write<00:02:36.879> us<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.359> if<00:02:37.480> bonds<00:02:38.170> are

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
just write us now so if bonds are

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.729 
just write us now so if bonds are
heading<00:02:39.790> lower<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.870> means<00:02:40.930> interest<00:02:41.859> rates

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
heading lower that means interest rates

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.390 
heading lower that means interest rates
interest<00:02:44.739> rates<00:02:44.950> will<00:02:45.430> rise<00:02:46.709> alright<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.889> if

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
interest rates will rise alright and if

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.399 
interest rates will rise alright and if
interest<00:02:48.609> rates<00:02:48.909> are<00:02:49.209> rising<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.780> means<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
interest rates are rising that means of

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.899 
interest rates are rising that means of
course<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.790> inflation<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:53.159> going<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.519> show

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
course that inflation is going to show

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.539 
course that inflation is going to show
up<00:02:55.060> its<00:02:55.209> ugly<00:02:55.569> head<00:02:55.599> so<00:02:56.560> one<00:02:57.310> particular

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
up its ugly head so one particular

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.939 
up its ugly head so one particular
reason<00:02:58.090> why<00:02:58.449> gold<00:02:58.719> maybe<00:02:59.139> is<00:02:59.319> not<00:02:59.530> dropping

00:02:59.939 --> 00:02:59.949 
reason why gold maybe is not dropping

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.399 
reason why gold maybe is not dropping
here<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.459> because<00:03:00.819> gold<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.419> also<00:03:01.870> seen<00:03:02.199> as<00:03:02.379> a

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
here is because gold is also seen as a

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.869 
here is because gold is also seen as a
hedge<00:03:02.969> against<00:03:03.969> so<00:03:04.629> as<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> hedge<00:03:05.879> against

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
hedge against so as a hedge against

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.420 
hedge against so as a hedge against
inflation<00:03:08.250> alright

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
inflation alright

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.939 
inflation alright
so<00:03:09.879> this<00:03:10.719> is<00:03:10.900> really<00:03:11.079> beginning<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.439> get<00:03:11.620> very

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:11.949 
so this is really beginning to get very

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.129 
so this is really beginning to get very
interesting<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.609> on<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:12.849> market<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.689> I

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
interesting here on this market and I

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.720 
interesting here on this market and I
think<00:03:14.379> potentially<00:03:14.769> we're<00:03:15.280> getting<00:03:15.519> very

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
think potentially we're getting very

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.080 
think potentially we're getting very
close<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.239> game-changer<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.260> gold<00:03:17.949> and<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
close to a game-changer in gold and the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.969 
close to a game-changer in gold and the
stock<00:03:19.329> market<00:03:19.720> as<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> whole<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.590> certainly

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
stock market as a whole so certainly

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.869 
stock market as a whole so certainly
going<00:03:21.069> to<00:03:21.129> be<00:03:21.189> watching<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.609> very<00:03:21.790> closely

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
going to be watching this very closely

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.869 
going to be watching this very closely
in<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:23.049> coming<00:03:23.349> days<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.739> weeks<00:03:23.979> ahead<00:03:24.099> but

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
in the coming days and weeks ahead but

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.909 
in the coming days and weeks ahead but
there<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.269> one<00:03:25.599> thing<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:26.019> course<00:03:26.229> that<00:03:26.470> is

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
there is one thing of course that is

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.740 
there is one thing of course that is
keeping<00:03:27.310> me<00:03:27.430> kind<00:03:27.759> of<00:03:27.819> skeptical<00:03:28.269> by<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.629> way

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
keeping me kind of skeptical by the way

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.179 
keeping me kind of skeptical by the way
this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.079> level<00:03:29.319> of<00:03:29.379> just<00:03:29.620> drawn<00:03:29.799> here<00:03:30.040> for

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
this is a level of just drawn here for

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.490 
this is a level of just drawn here for
you<00:03:30.280> guys<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:31.299> bonds<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.930> gonna<00:03:32.079> be<00:03:32.169> a<00:03:32.199> level

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
you guys on bonds is gonna be a level

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.710 
you guys on bonds is gonna be a level
you<00:03:32.680> want<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:32.859> watch<00:03:33.069> very<00:03:33.310> closely<00:03:33.549> but<00:03:33.909> 146

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
you want to watch very closely but 146

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.110 
you want to watch very closely but 146
level<00:03:34.989> here<00:03:35.229> ok<00:03:35.919> that's<00:03:36.129> a<00:03:36.220> very<00:03:36.430> key<00:03:36.669> support

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
level here ok that's a very key support

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420 
level here ok that's a very key support
level<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:37.449> bonds<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.139> if<00:03:38.259> and<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:38.769> bonds<00:03:39.069> take

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
level on bonds and if and if bonds take

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.069 
level on bonds and if and if bonds take
out<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:39.729> level<00:03:39.970> then<00:03:40.239> certainly<00:03:40.659> that<00:03:40.720> could

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
out this level then certainly that could

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.619 
out this level then certainly that could
show<00:03:41.739> us<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.889> huge<00:03:42.220> indication<00:03:42.639> we're<00:03:43.150> seeing<00:03:43.419> a

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
show us a huge indication we're seeing a

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.830 
show us a huge indication we're seeing a
rise<00:03:43.870> in<00:03:43.930> interest<00:03:44.259> rates<00:03:44.909> now<00:03:45.909> let's<00:03:46.180> just

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
rise in interest rates now let's just

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.479 
rise in interest rates now let's just
show<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.079> this<00:03:47.290> particular<00:03:47.560> index<00:03:48.340> as<00:03:48.459> well

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
show you this particular index as well

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.309 
show you this particular index as well
so<00:03:48.790> if<00:03:48.879> you<00:03:48.939> look<00:03:49.060> at<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.180> dollar<00:03:49.449> the<00:03:50.290> dollar

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
so if you look at the dollar the dollar

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.550 
so if you look at the dollar the dollar
index<00:03:51.389> alright<00:03:52.389> this<00:03:52.689> is<00:03:52.840> partly<00:03:53.139> what's

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
index alright this is partly what's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.679 
index alright this is partly what's
confusing<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.879> whole<00:03:55.000> situation<00:03:55.150> here

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
confusing the whole situation here

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.390 
confusing the whole situation here
because<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.500> dollar<00:03:56.739> has<00:03:57.040> remained

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
because the dollar has remained

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.539 
because the dollar has remained
particularly<00:03:57.909> strong<00:03:58.269> as<00:03:58.569> we've<00:03:58.810> seen<00:03:59.549> just

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
particularly strong as we've seen just

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.520 
particularly strong as we've seen just
have<00:04:00.699> a<00:04:00.729> look<00:04:00.879> at<00:04:00.969> this<00:04:01.090> here

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
have a look at this here

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.039 
have a look at this here
so<00:04:02.919> the<00:04:03.340> dollar<00:04:03.579> has<00:04:03.819> rallied<00:04:04.269> here<00:04:04.629> remained

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
so the dollar has rallied here remained

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.899 
so the dollar has rallied here remained
very<00:04:05.290> strong<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.979> in<00:04:06.040> fact<00:04:06.250> potentially

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
very strong and in fact potentially

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.270 
very strong and in fact potentially
could<00:04:07.030> still<00:04:07.239> head<00:04:07.689> higher<00:04:07.900> from<00:04:08.169> here<00:04:08.409> but

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
could still head higher from here but

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.640 
could still head higher from here but
certainly<00:04:10.000> if<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.449> dollar<00:04:10.689> continues<00:04:11.229> to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
certainly if the dollar continues to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.459 
certainly if the dollar continues to
remain<00:04:12.039> strong<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.459> continues<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.539> rally

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
remain strong and continues to rally

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.069 
remain strong and continues to rally
from<00:04:15.310> here<00:04:15.729> I<00:04:15.849> mean<00:04:16.329> we<00:04:16.599> don't<00:04:16.719> know<00:04:16.870> if<00:04:16.989> it

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
from here I mean we don't know if it

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.259 
from here I mean we don't know if it
will<00:04:17.229> but<00:04:17.560> if<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.769> does<00:04:18.009> then<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:18.849> certainly

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
will but if it does then that certainly

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.330 
will but if it does then that certainly
is<00:04:19.389> gonna<00:04:19.539> put<00:04:19.719> downward<00:04:20.019> pressure<00:04:20.199> on<00:04:20.739> gold

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
is gonna put downward pressure on gold
