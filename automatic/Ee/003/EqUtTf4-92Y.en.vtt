00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590

anyway I decided this wasn't good enough
even<00:01:10.590> after<00:01:10.740> I've<00:01:10.980> taken<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.370> little

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.050 
have done this now I gave the sucker a
blue<00:01:52.320> paint<00:01:52.650> job<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.580> exact

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
blue paint job it's not quite the exact

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.770 
blue paint job it's not quite the exact
same<00:01:54.330> blue<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> neck<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.950> yeah<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
same blue as the neck but yeah I like it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.810 
same blue as the neck but yeah I like it
I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.260> looks<00:01:58.410> kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.620> cool<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:59.130> used<00:01:59.670> an

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I think it looks kind of cool I used an

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.030 
I think it looks kind of cool I used an
acrylic<00:02:00.240> paint<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:01.320> there's<00:02:01.500> definitely<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
acrylic paint so there's definitely a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640 
acrylic paint so there's definitely a
pattern<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.760> funky<00:02:03.300> swirly<00:02:03.810> pattern<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.410> on

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
pattern a funky swirly pattern going on

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.970 
pattern a funky swirly pattern going on
in<00:02:04.950> there<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.340> did<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.480> multiple<00:02:07.020> layers<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
in there I did it in multiple layers and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.830 
in there I did it in multiple layers and
I<00:02:08.250> did<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.670> layers<00:02:08.910> more<00:02:09.179> than<00:02:09.360> others<00:02:09.599> just

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
I did some layers more than others just

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.830 
I did some layers more than others just
to<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:11.180> non-uniform<00:02:12.180> look<00:02:12.660> I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
to kind of get a non-uniform look I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.690 
to kind of get a non-uniform look I
thought<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.170> would<00:02:13.290> be

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
thought that would be

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.360 
thought that would be
cooler<00:02:13.879> than<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.510> straight<00:02:14.840> blue<00:02:15.440> ukulele

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
cooler than just a straight blue ukulele

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.839 
cooler than just a straight blue ukulele
so<00:02:17.300> yeah<00:02:17.480> I've<00:02:17.780> taken<00:02:18.019> my<00:02:18.290> favorite<00:02:18.860> old<00:02:19.099> blue

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
so yeah I've taken my favorite old blue

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.410 
so yeah I've taken my favorite old blue
Mahalo<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.510> turned<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> into<00:02:21.560> an<00:02:22.420> actual

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
Mahalo and turned it into an actual

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
see how it sounded the only possible

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.479 
see how it sounded the only possible
thing<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.799> bit<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.190> disappointment

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
thing that is a bit of a disappointment

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.430 
thing that is a bit of a disappointment
is<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.090> electric<00:03:29.540> i<00:03:30.370> mounted<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.670> pickup

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
is the electric i mounted the pickup

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.140 
is the electric i mounted the pickup
absolutely<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.560> wrong<00:03:33.739> place<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.340> maybe

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
absolutely in the wrong place and maybe

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.240 
absolutely in the wrong place and maybe
with<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> banjo<00:03:36.079> ukulele<00:03:36.470> simply<00:03:37.160> as

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
with a banjo ukulele simply as

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.590 
with a banjo ukulele simply as
impossible<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.850> mount<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.389> right

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
impossible to mount it in the right

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.039 
impossible to mount it in the right
place<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.139> mount<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.870> wooden<00:03:41.870> back

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
place I mount it to the wooden back

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.979 
place I mount it to the wooden back
piece<00:03:42.730> which<00:03:43.730> perhaps<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.660> isn't<00:03:44.840> getting

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
piece which perhaps this isn't getting

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.809 
piece which perhaps this isn't getting
enough<00:03:45.170> vibration<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.040> transmit<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.639> sound

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
enough vibration to transmit the sound

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.809 
enough vibration to transmit the sound
properly<00:03:47.510> through<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.350> really<00:03:48.620> big<00:03:48.889> amp<00:03:49.130> it

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
properly through a really big amp it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.460 
properly through a really big amp it
works<00:03:50.030> fine<00:03:50.329> but<00:03:50.389> through<00:03:50.870> my<00:03:51.019> little<00:03:51.290> pig

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
works fine but through my little pig

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.410 
works fine but through my little pig
nose<00:03:51.650> for<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:51.950> little<00:03:52.130> small<00:03:52.370> amp<00:03:52.579> it's<00:03:53.269> not

nose for a little small amp it's not

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.140 
nose for a little small amp it's not
fantastic<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.459> regardless<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.700> very<00:03:55.970> loud

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
fantastic but regardless it's very loud
