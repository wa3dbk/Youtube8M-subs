the<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.079> thing<00:02:07.409> which<00:02:07.619> i<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> extremely

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the one thing which i think is extremely

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.639 
the one thing which i think is extremely
important<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.420> drives<00:02:09.690> home<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> extent

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
important is it drives home the extent

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.680 
important is it drives home the extent
to<00:02:10.679> which<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.069> gold<00:02:11.280> market<00:02:11.459> really<00:02:12.180> doesn't

leaving Switzerland they completely off
base<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.840> mean<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.379> incredibly<00:02:22.159> stupid

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
base I mean it is incredibly stupid

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.789 
base I mean it is incredibly stupid
second<00:02:23.659> thing<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.019> much<00:02:24.110> more<00:02:24.260> important<00:02:24.680> and

much<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:25.069> bullish<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.579> think<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.909> the<00:02:26.390> fact

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
much more bullish I think is the fact

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.979 
much more bullish I think is the fact
that<00:02:26.720> yes<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.159> not<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.430> China<00:02:28.879> story<00:02:29.269> you
