00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.830
 I think back to a very different one 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.370
 time wolfgang witte water yes there 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.849
 been 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.820
 the wander Bodensee and have one there 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.759
 Inventor visited and the inventor was called 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.830
 Otto Müller together with his wife 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.930
 ilse müller that was always there 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.080
 if Otto Müller had anything to do 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.010
 And this otto müller has me at one 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.800
 walk something completely told he said 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.190
 I even looked at my pentium 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.980
 that was 93 we think so around there 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.860
 the time around the pentium viewed 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.960
 and have seen that has so many 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.420
 Rest times then he does not do anything and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.539
 then I am through the forest 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.950
 Walk along Lake Constance and have me 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.320
 thought how could you do that 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.469
 do better and come out at the same time 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.600
 is a half stone half town that was 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.690
 a processor was very variable 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.520
 and he does not have him break this 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.039
 as the pentium was also a lot 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.250
 smaller of the transistors he but 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.740
 much more effective and you could do it 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.890
 adapt to telecommunication devices 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.990
 or even as an mp3 player as 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 processor or we still have to today 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.229
 find is at the sd cards 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
 as a processor as well as a customer and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.210
 scooter 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.900
 what do you have memories of this 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.729
 car miller totally wrong otto müller us 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.159
 went for a walk 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 the evening also walk to the Swiss 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.530
 eaten and when he starts to tell 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 I then told how how does it work 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.299
 So actually the run since the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.009
 along Lake Constance how can you get one 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.540
 Processor just thinking in the head 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.990
 when they come back you are now 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.079
 15 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.090
 because i said no no till so long 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.070
 the processor is finished the new core 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 finished I do not take any notes 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.210
 but the one that works in your head says 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.619
 how do you all that he said 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 I do not know that is just im 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.060
 head under it the processes yes the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.159
 but in vain was such 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.659
 split and it was just the years 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.729
 you could also go deep into it with him 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.670
 go down to the single gate 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.130
 down 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.700
 he has pacified everything that is that is 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.130
 it is precisely the attribute of chemistry that one can 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.300
 certainly here your use absolutely so 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.520
 definitely with him 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
 He had therefore quite pitch he 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.480
 the company siemens wanted it 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.480
 Do things for the car yes with the hyper 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.489
 stone the company siemens were there 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.069
 constantly with him with several people 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.590
 and at some point there was a change in 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.040
 the siemens central and there was none 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.890
 more 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.200
 and otto müller sat alone on his 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.150
 nothing happened on its development 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.580
 paid more and he had to go now 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.870
 asia and had to see if he was there 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.790
 maybe someone will find him 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.980
 supported and he has it too 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.420
 found only yes he never had the chance 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.140
 had the was in fact at that time so the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.930
 time calm in the arm processors corner 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.430
 pushed into it and would have worldwide 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.680
 can make revenue so 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.720
 that was the merit of siemens 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.900
 I think that was just when 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.819
 When we got down there that was an issue 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.260
 what it is very very sad on what 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.510
 we are there and we catch that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.440
 outrageous as you just someone 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.190
 let sit 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.840
 he will but that's the way it is and all 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.739
 big companies have done that in the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.959
 past broadcast 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.079
 We talked about seven jobs 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.760
 also the world has the people in 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.470
 Apple sold in the apple before 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.180
 countries were then you have the things 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.140
 all closed in base for the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.200
 Example in Germany 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.120
 here wool gates also has a lot 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.310
 certainly here was a genius too 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.930
 some plates made even though it was the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.720
 processor and the company still exists today 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.799
 unfortunately, müller is deceased or müller 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.440
 Of course, before at nixdorf the 820 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.790
 developed for the 820 so it was him 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.840
 was not his first work what he 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.849
 has committed 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.849
 I could not do that in my head
