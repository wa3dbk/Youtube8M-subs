00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.170 
without any glitches you can just walk
with<00:03:05.519> her<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> still<00:03:06.510> looks<00:03:06.540> flawless<00:03:08.180> so

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
with her and it still looks flawless so

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.199 
with her and it still looks flawless so
it<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.989> looks<00:03:10.170> fine<00:03:10.820> only<00:03:11.820> way<00:03:12.000> you're

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
it kind of looks fine only way you're

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.850 
it kind of looks fine only way you're
sitting<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> horse<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:16.170> just<00:03:16.530> looked<00:03:16.769> like

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
sitting on a horse it just looked like

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.030 
sitting on a horse it just looked like
you<00:03:17.280> see<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> butt<00:03:18.060> crack<00:03:18.330> just<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.260> think<00:03:19.860> that's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
you see a butt crack just I think that's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.310 
you see a butt crack just I think that's
a<00:03:20.130> little<00:03:20.280> bit<00:03:20.550> out<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:21.690> worry<00:03:22.080> like

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
a little bit out and I don't worry like

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.559 
a little bit out and I don't worry like
that<00:03:23.780> let<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.930> overall<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.220> looks<00:03:26.820> nice

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
that let it overall it it looks nice

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.640 
that let it overall it it looks nice
so<00:03:31.989> now<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.230> looks<00:03:33.379> fine<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> problem<00:03:35.650> when

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
so now it looks fine not a problem when

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.339 
so now it looks fine not a problem when
you<00:03:36.739> go<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> little<00:03:37.190> bit<00:03:37.430> faster<00:03:37.580> just<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:39.200> is

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
you go a little bit faster just it is

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.259 
you go a little bit faster just it is
just<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.709> shimmer<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.459> just<00:03:40.640> almost<00:03:40.790> looks

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
just a shimmer but it just almost looks

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.770 
just a shimmer but it just almost looks
like<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.750> see<00:03:42.670> slightly<00:03:43.670> part<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.420> butt

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
like you see slightly part of a butt

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:57.330 
like you see slightly part of a butt
crack<00:03:47.349> which<00:03:48.349> I<00:03:48.530> don't<00:03:48.769> really<00:03:49.340> really<00:03:49.959> like

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.509 

but<00:03:57.879> overall<00:03:58.300> yet<00:03:58.840> again<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.920> lovely<00:04:03.160> mom

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
but overall yet again it's a lovely mom

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.960 
but overall yet again it's a lovely mom
all<00:04:04.180> right<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.019> kind<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.530> logical<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.790> as

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
all right it is kind of logical but as

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.809 
all right it is kind of logical but as
mod<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.540> not<00:04:07.900> made<00:04:08.290> for<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.709> male<00:04:09.010> character<00:04:09.310> so

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
mod is not made for a male character so

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.039 
mod is not made for a male character so
you<00:04:09.879> can<00:04:10.150> only<00:04:10.300> use<00:04:10.510> those<00:04:11.110> female<00:04:11.650> characters

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
you can only use those female characters

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.770 
you can only use those female characters
it<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.260> logic<00:04:14.739> but<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.730> checked<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.239> out<00:04:16.329> anyway

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
it is logic but I checked it out anyway

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.150 
it is logic but I checked it out anyway
and<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:18.070> not<00:04:18.639> wearable<00:04:19.630> for<00:04:20.049> meals<00:04:20.320> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
and it's not not wearable for meals of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.659 
and it's not not wearable for meals of
course<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:23.490> think<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.910> looks<00:04:25.270> good<00:04:25.750> a

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
course and I think it looks good a

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.409 
course and I think it looks good a
little<00:04:27.669> little<00:04:29.220> well<00:04:30.220> dark<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.820> with<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.150> belt

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
little little well dark on with the belt

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.600 
little little well dark on with the belt
you<00:04:32.320> cannot<00:04:32.620> really<00:04:32.889> see<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.280> she<00:04:33.460> has<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
you cannot really see that she has a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
you cannot really see that she has a
belt<00:04:34.090> on<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:35.350> would<00:04:35.590> be<00:04:35.770> nice<00:04:35.950> if<00:04:35.979> they<00:04:36.370> have

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
belt on so it would be nice if they have

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.100 
belt on so it would be nice if they have
some<00:04:37.630> more<00:04:39.000> detail<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.930> can

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
some more detail to it so that you can

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.520 
some more detail to it so that you can
see<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.710> he<00:04:41.919> wears<00:04:42.130> a<00:04:42.340> belt<00:04:42.520> over<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:44.380> will

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
see is he wears a belt over it that will

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.310 
see is he wears a belt over it that will
be<00:04:44.650> awesome<00:04:48.539> that<00:04:49.539> will<00:04:49.690> be<00:04:49.810> awesome<00:04:49.960> if

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
be awesome that will be awesome if

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.350 
be awesome that will be awesome if
though<00:04:50.530> would<00:04:51.280> be<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.460> change<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:52.000> could<00:04:52.180> be<00:04:52.330> a

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
though would be a change of could be a

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.350 
though would be a change of could be a
chase<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.039> straps<00:04:54.430> on<00:04:54.669> our<00:04:54.820> arms

their<00:05:01.210> arms<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.720> on<00:05:01.870> our<00:05:02.050> body<00:05:02.320> piece<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:03.520> will

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
their arms and on our body piece it will
