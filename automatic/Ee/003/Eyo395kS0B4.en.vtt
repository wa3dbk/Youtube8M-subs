be coming up on the channel very soon

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.819 
be coming up on the channel very soon
so<00:03:16.370> you've<00:03:16.519> got<00:03:16.639> that<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.909> look<00:03:16.940> forward<00:03:17.090> to

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
so you've got that to look forward to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.199 
so you've got that to look forward to
and<00:03:18.829> then<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.010> think<00:03:19.190> there<00:03:19.400> might<00:03:19.609> be<00:03:19.670> one<00:03:19.819> more

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
and then I think there might be one more

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.390 
and then I think there might be one more
base<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.750> there<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> base<00:03:21.170> for<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:21.739> myself

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
base is there a base for that one myself

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.149 
base is there a base for that one myself
oh<00:03:22.909> no<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:24.139> there's<00:03:24.349> only<00:03:24.440> basis<00:03:24.889> for<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
oh no so there's only basis for the

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.099 
oh no so there's only basis for the
other<00:03:25.280> two<00:03:25.579> so<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.299> seems<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.659> the<00:03:26.780> other<00:03:26.930> two

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
other two so it seems like the other two

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.069 
other two so it seems like the other two
came<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:27.650> these<00:03:28.090> these<00:03:29.090> bases<00:03:29.629> but<00:03:29.780> not<00:03:29.959> the

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
came with these these bases but not the

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.170 
came with these these bases but not the
the<00:03:30.650> Styracosaurus<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:31.699> that's<00:03:31.849> great<00:03:32.150> I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
the Styracosaurus but that's great I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.789 
the Styracosaurus but that's great I
think<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.569> mean<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.810> know<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.139> use<00:03:33.440> these<00:03:33.590> for
