for farming because i need to get my

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.300 
for farming because i need to get my
farming<00:01:20.820> level<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> only<00:01:21.990> 60<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.740> a

farming level up this is only 60 and a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
farming level up this is only 60 and a
lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.670> skills<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.030> getting<00:01:24.090> 70<00:01:24.479> Plus<00:01:24.689> now

over a mil and a half XP or so but

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.619 
over a mil and a half XP or so but
that's<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.379> bad<00:02:13.530> cuz<00:02:13.739> it's<00:02:13.860> cooking<00:02:14.159> so

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
here we have the tools tab the random

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.020 
here we have the tools tab the random
tab<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.080> probably<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> tab<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.310> looks<00:02:20.580> or

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
tab and probably the tab that looks or

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
tab and probably the tab that looks or
is<00:02:21.209> worth<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> most<00:02:21.780> sort<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.440> moment<00:02:22.709> is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
is worth the most sort at the moment is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.210 
is worth the most sort at the moment is
my<00:02:23.340> Slayer<00:02:23.610> tab<00:02:23.879> /<00:02:24.330> booze<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:24.989> blue<00:02:25.170> tab<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.190> I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
my Slayer tab / booze for blue tab so I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.979 
my Slayer tab / booze for blue tab so I
kept<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.459> tab<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.030> probably<00:02:27.360> worth<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
kept this tab is probably worth to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.380 
kept this tab is probably worth to
millers<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.560> I'm<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.489> guessing<00:02:29.640> Mel<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.329> a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
millers so I'm just guessing Mel and a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.569 
millers so I'm just guessing Mel and a

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.530 
now instead of wasting the money on
something<00:03:15.540> else<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.349> another<00:03:16.590> skill<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.540> yeah
