00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.479
 hello friends good this video is what 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.690
 I dedicate to Pablito I had promised 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:12.450
 he is a fan of these lamps are the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.849
 xenon lamps because good what happened 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.950
 with the mask you already know that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.420
 they watched the videos that is nothing more 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.760
 original expensive and does not have the bluff 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.160
 original this bluff is much smaller 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.610
 that the original with which he lost something 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.110
 of luminosity with the halogen lamp 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.500
 although I'm happy with the lamp 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.860
 led I am quite dissatisfied with the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.350
 halogen lamp then the best way 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.420
 to give you more power will be easier 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.920
 change the halogen lamp that is very 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.040
 similar to a h3c is here I'm going to 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.680
 change for these were these lamps in 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.790
 on work with these ballasts 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.790
 a ballast of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 35 watts are of different powers 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.320
 35 and work with 23 thousand volts that is 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.840
 the output we have high voltage for 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.370
 our great xenon stop and what 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.820
 is the most powerful thing that can be reached 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.820
 to put 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.220
 they will have seen many cars or even 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.110
 some motorcycles generate a light enough 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.230
 azure blue that depends on the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 temperature is 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.070
 6000 6000 I think it's pretty white 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.000
 then it 's good to impersonate it 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.620
 original that went here 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.760
 directly with benefit I bought them 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 by mercadolibre 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.130
 the turn off 280 pesos 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.720
 so I'm here to put the nut 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.120
 it's a small adaptation but I think 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.500
 is ready and the advantage of this has 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.630
 lamp is that it has high and low as 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 how does this work good change the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.150
 angle changes the angle of the lamp 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.460
 there we see a small light when it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.180
 active the high light changes the angle 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.510
 I do not really want to touch it but 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.790
 pivots in this way 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.720
 then it also changes angle and changes 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.299
 the focus and makes it have low and 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.159
 high with the same lamp because it has 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.959
 the only one who commits has to have is 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.209
 the signal that it takes to undertake a 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.849
 little bit so the wink is something 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.650
 complicated because if we had two one 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.880
 for is and another for low would take 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 undertake and it would not take effect then 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.190
 keep in mind that here I will have high and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.770
 falls within the same little bit as 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.440
 likely to be directly what 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.360
 replace because I used it 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.150
 as opposition and high but I do not know 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.070
 justify because I'm going to have the high 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.800
 in this other lamp with which I'm going 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.650
 I'm going to take it out and probably put 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.030
 a band of 100 thousand numbers that are from 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.120
 good power as position light 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.980
 only so good stick here 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.900
 you have the video 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.849
 Now I'm just going to put it together and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.420
 then in any case we will see how it is 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.420
 working
