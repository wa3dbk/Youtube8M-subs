00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 weekend weather with the prospects 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.849
 called with a cross and greet god when 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 weather for all who are right now 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.639
 sunny stable spring weather 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.320
 I expect a bit more 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 wait, it's sure to come 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 changeable phase purely for the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.130
 coming five to seven days 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.869
 the north of germany's war first 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 changeable weather always look 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.740
 again, then probably 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 direction middle of the week slow improvement 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.910
 the shivers are becoming rarer and rarer 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 the sunny sections are getting longer and longer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 but it gets really clean 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 probably not with the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.390
 Northeast wind always a good sign for 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 The coast then slowly a bit 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.610
 the rest of the rest dries out 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 Germany also the next days 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.300
 rather changeable with chills 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 short breaks it gets pretty 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 Freshen the temperatures during the day only 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.050
 still mostly between 10 and 15 degrees 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 the snowfall border in the alps 1100 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.789
 until 1400 meters in this direction 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 that's probably true if they're over somewhere 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.020
 they want a pass or something 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.240
 expect that next to it temporarily 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.330
 at least have snow-covered roads 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 the same is true for the saturday 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.360
 lift oso until the beginning of july finished 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 be waived and an update court always 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.100
 again changeable april on 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.140
 searched and a German and a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.130
 ship again and hear again call 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.509
 pretty cold we have in the old one 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.340
 border between 100 and 400 meters and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 as dobernig as the winter times 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.500
 at least temporarily if they are 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 currently on seehofer pink or orders 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.299
 open and so nice again like it 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.210
 next week special feature for the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.909
 east austria vienna 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.460
 the saturday morning so okay to still 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 a lot of sun and about 20 degrees a breath 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 from the past more than a breath of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.320
 spring monday is whole again 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.240
 okay sunday in between too 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.210
 reduced in vienna and eastern austria 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 generally behind then changeable with 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.090
 shudder 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.520
 but the temperatures are slowing down too 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.099
 recover direction 15 to 20 degrees 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.160
 So not quite as cool as Germany 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.300
 and Switzerland 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.150
 everyone will write that again 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 the Ice Saints are not ard 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 spectators will remember 1582 has 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.380
 Pope Gregor said I want it all 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 ten days later is Gregorian 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.460
 calendar reform and the igloo the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.800
 then, so you really participated 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.240
 sees a small dent in the long run 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.680
 temperature course around the 25th 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.870
 that's just right now 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.130
 calendrical iguanas fits where 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.350
 they actually do not really exist 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.880
 are pure coincidence but will 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.600
 anyway, wherever I wrote him 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.040
 does not need to tell any further 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.450
 she did not tell it again 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.240
 Somehow the summer is getting hot again 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.770
 Every year he will kick that 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.360
 On the contrary, maybe it will work out 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.460
 sometimes the chance is always fifty 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.340
 fifty and hope for the whole 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.290
 charlatans always some fucking 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.540
 tell and then reprinted 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.820
 and someday it will be written 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.110
 maybe this 50 hit rate 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.270
 like to arrive 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.220
 So far, almost always the opposite was the case 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.260
 but if you can be that it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.600
 This year I wish it all 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.060
 The people who like a beautiful and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.000
 want to have hot summer so that was 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.320
 I believe the essential 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.910
 after this changeable and cool week 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.740
 He does not know what's going on 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.990
 after her is completely apart 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.480
 but can not become a summer still 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.310
 stay late winter 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.440
 BlÃ¼mchen alarm does not look dramatic 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.680
 maybe get along 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.360
 Thursday morning the local frost in the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.670
 ground is the reason is just too many 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.459
 clouds and too much wind still there and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.830
 that usually prevents just that 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.930
 next to it a really frosty clear and 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.610
 chooses to give quiet night if I can 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.680
 Something else will change course 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.989
 the information always on twitter @ 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.810
 tile man or facebook tile man 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.880
 weather and these are the essentials 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.160
 things e mails is a nice 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.940
 good monday and ever for 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.940
 god and bye
