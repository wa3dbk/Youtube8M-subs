00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the adjectives that are quick and easy 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.560
 you will choose to describe the dish of the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.930
 day 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.090
 the menu in fact provides a pizza without 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 brewer's yeast and without any other 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 type of leavening agent even if not 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.750
 you can certainly define true pizza e 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.570
 the one I suggest today is 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 a compromise for those who are intolerant or 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 allergic to brewer's yeast and also 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 to substances present in yeasts 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.810
 Today's pizza chemists is also a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 pseudo pizza let's call it so indicated 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 for those who want to propose something new 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.940
 and alternative and little guests without 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 give up the taste for the dough 370 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.059
 grams of white flour 00 180 thousand 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 liters of water 8 grams of salt 30 thousand 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 liters of seed oil or 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 extra virgin for the filling 200 grams 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.770
 of tomato sauce 300 g of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.350
 mozzarella for pizza a spoon of 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 oregano then girls the doses I have you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 suggested go well between preparation 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.379
 of two pizzas two pizzas because I make you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 see two different cooking methods 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.610
 the first we will use the plate in 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.100
 refractory stone that you are already 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 heating is this here mine was in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.290
 supplied with the forms however clearly 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.180
 you can also buy it online 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.549
 the second most classic method provides 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.330
 instead the use of the classic pan 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.900
 in other words, for the dripping pan, ok 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's start with the preparation 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.850
 dough 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.140
 here I have already sieved white flour 0 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 0 in a bowl 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.369
 you can also mix half the flour 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 white in whole wholemeal flour 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.020
 do not recommend invitations to use only 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.530
 wholemeal flour then pour water over the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 salt 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.850
 and 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 possibly 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.270
 we mix everything together before 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.520
 wooden spoon and then and hand up to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 obtain a smooth and compact dough 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.500
 if necessary and add a little bit 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.500
 of flour if the mixture is too much 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 sticky 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.620
 so we got a nice ball 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.540
 of dough though even if there is no 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.480
 we must leave yeast anyway 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.610
 rest the dough so that it relaxes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 to form gluten in this way 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 the dough we will be able to roll out a lot 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.560
 easily even with hands without 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.890
 then use the rolling pin 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.840
 we keep out of the fridge about an hour after a 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 now here we are, the ball came 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.489
 rested and we can remove it from the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.690
 We cut the film in half because 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.780
 we said we want to do two 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.300
 pizzas ok so 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.950
 we leave the other piece of dough from 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.100
 always starts with the film otherwise 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.200
 dry we put plenty of flour 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.620
 under white or semolina you see 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.910
 how it opens up as elastic even in the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.400
 we do not use our pizza base 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.709
 rolling pin because we want to do 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.459
 incorporate the area as much as possible 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.459
 inside the dough 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.769
 I am not a pizzaiola, however 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.989
 it took me a bit of effort now 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.970
 put the tomato puree immediately 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.910
 I advise you not to overdo it with the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.640
 quantity of ingredients because it is one 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.500
 pasta that will not inflate obviously 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.810
 cooking precisely because there is no 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.970
 we can however flavor the yeast 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.989
 tomato sauce with a little salt 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.780
 pepper and a goccino of oil if we want 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.940
 we are a bit of mozzarella for pizza 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.890
 otherwise the classic mozzarella tends 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.590
 to lose some liquid, however, this is 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.390
 my opinion then is up to you to decide the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.390
 type of cheese and also procedure 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.820
 to use we also put some 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.450
 Origan 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.959
 I did a classic in short, let's take 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.060
 then the special pizza shovel and with a 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.860
 decisive blow let's go below put us 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.390
 always a bit of flour and I even put it 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.390
 also on the shovel 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.450
 now all we have to do is do 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.140
 always slide the pizza quickly 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:34.900
 on the plate we close 250 gr of oven 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.270
 already warm for up to 10 minutes 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.790
 in the meantime we carry on 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.350
 we prepare the second pizza for the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.750
 second impasto life the other see 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.270
 below we already put the parchment paper 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.330
 we always put a bit of semolina I have a little 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.410
 in short, we spread the white flour 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.410
 With the hands 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:03.019
 I transferred the base to the plate 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.149
 now we put ourselves as the only condiment 

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:07.069
 tomato not mozzarella that 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:09.649
 require different cooking times 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.110
 because the stone plate is already hot 

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:14.719
 while the plate this is normal 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.879
 we must bring in temperature then i 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:20.979
 cooking times of this pizza will be 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.979
 longer than the previous one 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.889
 meanwhile this is ready we wait 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.599
 the pizza of the stone plate and then 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.569
 let's see how to proceed for this 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:36.139
 second pizza very well passed 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:39.649
 eight minutes to 250 gr of always with the 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.739
 shovel we take away the pizza they have attention 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:44.449
 burn ourselves and this is the result 

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:48.229
 invites a lot of cooking 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.819
 let 's put the other one at 230 only 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.009
 grades then we need a little 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:57.529
 temperature 230 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.199
 only with tomato and then we see how 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:07.249
 put the mozzarella after ten 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:11.919
 minutes we remove the base from the thunder you see 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:16.369
 that is not cooked completely we finish 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:19.399
 with the mozzarella and then bake for 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:22.069
 another 5 minutes because this is because 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:25.989
 otherwise the mozzarella will burn if 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.989
 we had started from the beginning 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.330
 the kitchen has been invaded for a while 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:41.490
 wonderful 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.059
 so here they are our two pizzas 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:48.240
 the first 15 are cooked in two different ways 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:51.240
 cooking minutes on normal cloth e 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.649
 this instead eight minutes at temperature 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.330
 higher 250 degrees for 8 minutes 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:07:00.029
 let's try to cut to see the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.270
 even the consistency of the interior is 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:13.860
 quite crunchy cut one 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:15.869
 slice and this is the inside 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.729
 as you can see if the slice remains 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.759
 infects the word game even by holding 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.889
 with one hand 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:29.580
 we also keep a strip of this 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:30.119
 cooked on normal size and this is the 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.830
 result 

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:34.229
 and even this can be done safely 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.059
 hold the only advice in your hand 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:38.159
 what the only important trick of 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:40.349
 don't make pasta too big 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.300
 otherwise you would have problems during 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:43.979
 cooking because the inside could 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.199
 stay a little colder 

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.909
 for the rest that to say good appetite e 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.379
 good pizza all you see a like if
