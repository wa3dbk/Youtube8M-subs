00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.749 

this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.760> called<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.120> ramp<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:04.130> made<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.339> box

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is called a ramp I made this box

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.290 
this is called a ramp I made this box
basically<00:00:06.150> what<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:07.639> an<00:00:08.639> impedance

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
basically what it is is an impedance

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.060 
basically what it is is an impedance
interface<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:12.650> when<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.679> sees<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
interface so that when it sees the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.609 
interface so that when it sees the
guitar<00:00:14.309> amplifier<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.080> same<00:00:16.260> impedance

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
guitar amplifier it's the same impedance

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.650 
guitar amplifier it's the same impedance
as<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> guitar<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.270> plugging

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
as a guitar and it's just like plugging

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.320 
as a guitar and it's just like plugging
a<00:00:18.720> guitar<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.400> only<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.910> luxury

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
a guitar into it only I have to a luxury

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
a guitar into it only I have to a luxury
of<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.600> having<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> play<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.890> fiddle<00:00:23.100> with

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
of not having to play I can fiddle with

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.990 
of not having to play I can fiddle with
sounds<00:00:23.939> mic<00:00:24.570> placement<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.789> worried

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
sounds mic placement and just worried

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.570 
sounds mic placement and just worried
about<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.330> recording<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.279> by<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.519> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
about the recording of it by the way so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
about the recording of it by the way so
we're<00:00:29.849> using<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.480> shure<00:00:31.260> sm57<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.700> got<00:00:32.850> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we're using a shure sm57 I've got it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
we're using a shure sm57 I've got it
about<00:00:33.030> 30<00:00:33.329> degrees<00:00:33.480> off<00:00:33.809> access<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
about 30 degrees off access and by the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.220 
about 30 degrees off access and by the
way<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.820> modified<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.809> took<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
way this is modified I took the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.430 
way this is modified I took the
transformer<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.660> because<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> extends<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
transformer out because it extends the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.889 
transformer out because it extends the
range<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.070> makes<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.149> lows<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.980> smoother

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
range it makes the lows a lot smoother

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.920 
range it makes the lows a lot smoother
it<00:00:45.899> sounds<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.930> sm7<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:51.629> then<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it sounds more like a sm7 and then the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.580 
it sounds more like a sm7 and then the
other<00:00:51.960> mike<00:00:52.969> is<00:00:54.020> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.230> used<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
other mike is going to be used to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
other mike is going to be used to
capture<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.280> room<00:00:56.550> sound<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.070> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
capture the room sound and this is this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
capture the room sound and this is this
is<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> large<00:00:59.579> diaphragm<00:00:59.969> tube<00:01:00.449> mic<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> i

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is a large diaphragm tube mic that i

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.649 
is a large diaphragm tube mic that i
made<00:01:01.440> called<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> origin<00:01:02.460> g7<00:01:05.119> as<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.570> the

made called the origin g7 as for the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
made called the origin g7 as for the
rest<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> signal<00:01:07.409> path<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> mic

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
rest of the signal path this is the mic

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.749 
rest of the signal path this is the mic
pre<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.900> into

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
pre that it's going to be going into

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.539 
pre that it's going to be going into
this<00:01:17.759> mic<00:01:18.119> pre<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.689> make<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this mic pre I make these as well this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.609 
this mic pre I make these as well this
is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> solid-state<00:01:21.450> discrete<00:01:22.140> mic<00:01:22.799> pre<00:01:23.159> and

is a solid-state discrete mic pre and

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
is a solid-state discrete mic pre and
this<00:01:25.619> 57<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> side<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.479> then

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this 57 is going into this side and then

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.420 
this 57 is going into this side and then
straight<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> interface<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
straight into the interface and the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.550 
straight into the interface and the
large<00:01:32.430> diaphragm<00:01:32.729> tube<00:01:33.150> condenser<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.900> going

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
large diaphragm tube condenser is going

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
large diaphragm tube condenser is going
into<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
into this side and then from there it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.039 
into this side and then from there it
goes<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:39.079> compressor<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.000> opto

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
goes to this compressor this is a opto

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.850 
goes to this compressor this is a opto
tube<00:01:43.049> compressor<00:01:44.689> based<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.899> an<00:01:46.020> LA<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
tube compressor based on an LA to a it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
tube compressor based on an LA to a it's
a<00:01:46.920> clone<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> an<00:01:47.430> LA<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> circuit<00:01:48.329> with

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
a clone of an LA to a circuit with

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.160 
a clone of an LA to a circuit with
upgraded<00:01:49.799> parts<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.390> made<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> compressor<00:01:52.020> as

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
upgraded parts I made this compressor as

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:29.580 
upgraded parts I made this compressor as
well<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.659> let's<00:01:54.659> give<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.290> go

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.729 

cool<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.769> got<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.780> main<00:02:33.049> guitar<00:02:33.260> track

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
cool we got that the main guitar track

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.800 
cool we got that the main guitar track
from<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.069> Morris<00:02:34.519> aunt<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:34.969> 212<00:02:35.239> cabinet

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
from the Morris aunt in the 212 cabinet

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.759 
from the Morris aunt in the 212 cabinet
and<00:02:36.249> now<00:02:37.249> what<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:37.519> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.819> do<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.590> there<00:02:39.590> is

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
and now what I'm going to do is there is

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.979 
and now what I'm going to do is there is
a<00:02:40.299> second<00:02:41.299> guitar<00:02:41.629> track<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.749> often<00:02:44.749> for<00:02:44.900> this

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
a second guitar track and often for this

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.830 
a second guitar track and often for this
kind<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.260> music<00:02:46.000> doubling<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> guitar<00:02:47.480> track

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
kind of music doubling a guitar track

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.830 
kind of music doubling a guitar track
and<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:48.769> panning<00:02:49.310> them<00:02:49.430> left<00:02:49.670> right<00:02:50.030> makes

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and then panning them left right makes

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.429 
and then panning them left right makes
for<00:02:51.139> a<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.889> huge<00:02:52.400> thick<00:02:53.090> guitar<00:02:53.480> sound<00:02:53.810> but

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
for a really huge thick guitar sound but

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.649 
for a really huge thick guitar sound but
this<00:02:54.560> isn't<00:02:54.829> exactly<00:02:55.219> a<00:02:55.519> duplicate<00:02:56.299> guitar

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
this isn't exactly a duplicate guitar

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.970 
this isn't exactly a duplicate guitar
part<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> some<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.879> it<00:02:58.999> is<00:02:59.180> actually

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
part this is a some of it is actually

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.640 
part this is a some of it is actually
you<00:03:00.980> know<00:03:01.099> unison<00:03:01.939> played<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.450> same<00:03:02.659> and<00:03:02.930> some

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
you know unison played the same and some

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.759 
you know unison played the same and some
of<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:03.919> harmony<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.189> contrast

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
of it is harmony so just for contrast

chicky great engineer I worked with him
on<00:03:28.189> a<00:03:29.000> Jeff<00:03:29.299> Healey<00:03:29.510> record<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.939> he<00:03:31.939> took<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
on a Jeff Healey record and he took the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.339 
on a Jeff Healey record and he took the
amp<00:03:32.449> and<00:03:32.719> just<00:03:33.680> gave<00:03:33.859> it<00:03:34.009> balls<00:03:34.509> it<00:03:35.509> was<00:03:36.169> pretty

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
amp and just gave it balls it was pretty

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.719 
amp and just gave it balls it was pretty
tame<00:03:36.709> fairly<00:03:37.609> clean<00:03:37.879> at<00:03:38.090> before<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.370> I

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
tame fairly clean at before but now I

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.089 
tame fairly clean at before but now I
mean<00:03:41.329> it's<00:03:41.509> got<00:03:41.659> no<00:03:41.870> tone<00:03:42.169> it's<00:03:42.470> got<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:42.799> only

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
mean it's got no tone it's got it's only

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.089 
mean it's got no tone it's got it's only
things<00:03:43.370> got<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.639> loudness<00:03:44.090> control<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:45.099> that's

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
things got a loudness control and that's

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.830 
things got a loudness control and that's
we're<00:03:46.370> going<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.609> get<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:46.729> gain<00:03:46.970> from<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.479> the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
we're going to get a gain from and the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.860 
we're going to get a gain from and the
reason<00:03:47.989> we're<00:03:48.229> going<00:03:48.259> into<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:49.870> it's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
reason we're going into this it's

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.420 
reason we're going into this it's
because<00:03:51.169> it's<00:03:51.319> a<00:03:51.409> totally<00:03:51.739> different<00:03:51.799> sound

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
because it's a totally different sound

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.089 
because it's a totally different sound
than<00:03:52.759> the<00:03:53.090> more<00:03:53.449> than<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.900> Morris<00:03:54.229> head<00:03:54.439> the

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
than the more than the Morris head the

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.289 
than the more than the Morris head the
morris<00:03:55.400> had<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:55.819> know<00:03:55.909> it's<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.359> big<00:03:57.019> throaty

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
morris had you know it's a big throaty

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.979 
morris had you know it's a big throaty
deep<00:03:59.299> sound<00:03:59.840> big<00:04:00.319> huge<00:04:00.620> rock<00:04:00.919> sound<00:04:01.659> this<00:04:02.659> is

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
deep sound big huge rock sound this is

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.379 
deep sound big huge rock sound this is
actually<00:04:03.949> it's<00:04:04.099> just<00:04:04.250> good<00:04:04.400> tenant<00:04:04.970> speaker

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
actually it's just good tenant speaker

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.030 
actually it's just good tenant speaker
and<00:04:05.739> it's<00:04:06.739> much<00:04:07.099> ratty<00:04:07.609> or<00:04:07.849> sounding<00:04:08.389> and<00:04:09.040> so

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
and it's much ratty or sounding and so

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.289 
and it's much ratty or sounding and so
the<00:04:10.669> contrast<00:04:11.239> will<00:04:11.479> be<00:04:11.629> will<00:04:11.930> be<00:04:11.959> great<00:04:13.299> let

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
the contrast will be will be great let

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.459 
the contrast will be will be great let
me<00:04:14.359> just<00:04:14.540> give<00:04:14.659> you<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> little<00:04:14.900> sample<00:04:15.169> of<00:04:15.409> what
