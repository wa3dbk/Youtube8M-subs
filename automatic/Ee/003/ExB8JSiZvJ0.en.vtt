00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello my name is angelina and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.210
 Today I want to make out there is not a group 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.420
 battery beetles 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 this is a song for some reason we all like 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.410
 Of course they don't like her and I think 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.119
 is that this song is for all times at all 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.920
 places yes everywhere will suit many and know and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.750
 anastasia is really easy let's 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.890
 Iâ€™ll finally start learning first 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 chord is code h 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.220
 next comes the chord am 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.110
 then chord g 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.270
 and chord entrance 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:54.010
 we all had the usual eight we 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:57.250
 play half the battle for every chord 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.250
 so again 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.190
 that is, two blows down then on 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.160
 next chord and century beats 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:26.180
 we snow then 5th outwardly and the next 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.180
 again up up neither snow nor media 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 this 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.750
