00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.950
 updated updated mod 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.950
 wait wait 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:11.300
 that's what I love for nakida and classics then 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:16.660
 you broke the thing glades so come 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.660
 aside distilled off naked 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.130
 so is it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.130
 and we will buy this thing cheaply 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:32.000
 everything is not here already a certain campaign if you see 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.000
 don't enter the turn just drive straight 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.580
 so it's ok here we will buy this thing 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.580
 only rope 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.970
 radiator whole everything is fine 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.070
 Dodi's motorcycle is a big consumer 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.380
 the main thing is that I keep the whole completely you 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.340
 pebbles just for messing it all 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.950
 and your jeans saved you and your knee 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.220
 through the ticket steers not falling the one who is not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.220
 there is 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.900
 it can be with anyone with experiences 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.760
 inexperienced 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.760
 this situation is different 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.530
 but these cornerstones are 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:25.229
 very scary thing they do bad 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.699
 service when you slow down when you 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.919
 accelerate and when you turn in 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.990
 In general, everything that you do whatever you do 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:41.500
 it's all they will bother you 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:43.389
 prevent above all the fall and how with 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.560
 this fight is the main thing to expose the leg 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:49.900
 at least one so that if you carry it 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.590
 so that you could catch as bulan 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.280
 tightrope walker 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.820
 and does not accelerate or slow down if 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.160
 slow down just with a straight motorcycle 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.430
 smooth and ready to let go at any moment 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.020
 front brake so what if you 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.820
 front wheels block it right away 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.880
 support flexible from happened 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.880
 we
