00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
because as you can see i change the

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.030 
because as you can see i change the
world<00:00:16.000> gen<00:00:16.209> quite<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.480> bit<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:17.680> funny<00:00:17.920> because

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
world gen quite a bit it's funny because

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.320 
world gen quite a bit it's funny because
i<00:00:18.160> just<00:00:18.310> got<00:00:18.400> it<00:00:18.490> working<00:00:18.790> and<00:00:18.880> then<00:00:18.970> decided

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
i just got it working and then decided

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.840 
i just got it working and then decided
you<00:00:19.450> know<00:00:19.540> what<00:00:19.570> let's<00:00:19.870> change<00:00:20.110> it<00:00:20.200> all<00:00:20.850> it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
you know what let's change it all it's

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.270 
you know what let's change it all it's
kind<00:00:22.000> of<00:00:22.090> funny<00:00:22.270> but<00:00:23.020> yeah<00:00:23.260> basically<00:00:23.470> am<00:00:24.070> at

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
kind of funny but yeah basically am at

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.520 
kind of funny but yeah basically am at
the<00:00:24.400> moment<00:00:24.550> like<00:00:25.510> before<00:00:25.840> i<00:00:25.869> was<00:00:26.230> using<00:00:26.350> this

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530 
the moment like before i was using this

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.620 
the moment like before i was using this
kind<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.800> noise<00:00:26.980> gin<00:00:27.310> which<00:00:27.460> wasn't<00:00:27.670> great<00:00:27.850> so

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
kind of noise gin which wasn't great so

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.390 
kind of noise gin which wasn't great so
basically<00:00:28.960> have<00:00:29.140> this<00:00:29.289> noise<00:00:29.530> pattern<00:00:29.920> it's<00:00:30.310> a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
basically have this noise pattern it's a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.470 
basically have this noise pattern it's a
good<00:00:30.520> thing<00:00:30.580> you<00:00:30.760> generate<00:00:31.060> in<00:00:31.150> math<00:00:31.330> and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
good thing you generate in math and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.270 
good thing you generate in math and
that's<00:00:32.320> how<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.559> generate<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:32.949> world<00:00:33.100> but

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
that's how you generate the world but

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.489 
that's how you generate the world but
the<00:00:33.370> one<00:00:33.489> I<00:00:33.520> had<00:00:33.640> before<00:00:33.670> wasn't<00:00:34.059> great<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:34.510> I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
the one I had before wasn't great and I

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:36.869 
the one I had before wasn't great and I
did<00:00:35.649> a<00:00:35.679> lot<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.859> kind<00:00:36.039> like<00:00:36.129> you<00:00:36.429> know<00:00:36.519> magic

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
did a lot of kind like you know magic

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.209 
did a lot of kind like you know magic
with<00:00:37.179> it<00:00:37.329> to<00:00:37.420> try<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.600> make<00:00:37.749> it<00:00:37.839> better<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:39.100> it

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
with it to try and make it better but it

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.149 
with it to try and make it better but it
just<00:00:39.370> wasn't<00:00:39.519> great<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.409> so<00:00:41.409> annoyed<00:00:41.649> me<00:00:41.800> plus

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
just wasn't great and so annoyed me plus

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.969 
just wasn't great and so annoyed me plus
the<00:00:42.429> way<00:00:42.519> it<00:00:42.609> was<00:00:42.670> done<00:00:42.909> I<00:00:43.149> can<00:00:43.269> only<00:00:43.359> use<00:00:43.539> one

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
the way it was done I can only use one

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.700 
the way it was done I can only use one
noise<00:00:44.979> waveform<00:00:45.249> which<00:00:46.030> was<00:00:46.210> bad<00:00:46.559> whereas<00:00:47.559> now

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
noise waveform which was bad whereas now

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.619 
noise waveform which was bad whereas now
I<00:00:47.819> basically<00:00:48.819> went<00:00:49.149> for<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.359> completely

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
I basically went for a completely

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.410 
I basically went for a completely
different<00:00:50.019> algorithm<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:51.999> one<00:00:52.210> allows

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
different algorithm and this one allows

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.049 
different algorithm and this one allows
me<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:52.870> first<00:00:53.559> off<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.920> can<00:00:54.519> make<00:00:54.639> several<00:00:54.879> of

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
me to first off I can make several of

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.129 
me to first off I can make several of
them<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:55.269> mix<00:00:55.359> them<00:00:55.449> together<00:00:55.569> which<00:00:55.899> is<00:00:55.989> nice

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
them and mix them together which is nice

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.799 
them and mix them together which is nice
but<00:00:57.039> also<00:00:57.219> i<00:00:57.670> can<00:00:57.819> very<00:00:58.030> easily<00:00:58.120> tweak<00:00:58.629> this

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
but also i can very easily tweak this

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.209 
but also i can very easily tweak this
with<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.019> bit<00:00:59.109> of<00:00:59.139> math<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.739> make<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.039> totally

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
with a bit of math to make it totally

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.250 
with a bit of math to make it totally
different<00:01:00.699> I<00:01:00.850> mean<00:01:01.389> this<00:01:01.780> one<00:01:02.019> you're<00:01:02.139> seeing

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
different I mean this one you're seeing

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.789 
different I mean this one you're seeing
right<00:01:02.379> here<00:01:02.530> right<00:01:02.979> now<00:01:03.010> it's<00:01:03.789> an<00:01:04.720> let<00:01:05.590> me<00:01:05.649> just

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
right here right now it's an let me just

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.289 
right here right now it's an let me just
see<00:01:05.890> if<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.159> longer<00:01:06.670> render<00:01:06.909> distance<00:01:07.000> here

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
see if it a longer render distance here

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.929 
see if it a longer render distance here
Q<00:01:07.719> an<00:01:07.810> idea<00:01:08.340> basically<00:01:09.340> what<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.579> is<00:01:09.759> doing

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
Q an idea basically what this is doing

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.480 
Q an idea basically what this is doing
its<00:01:10.299> am<00:01:12.030> how<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.090> explain<00:01:13.329> this<00:01:14.369> currently<00:01:15.369> i'm

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
its am how to explain this currently i'm

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.340 
its am how to explain this currently i'm
taking<00:01:15.759> i<00:01:15.820> think<00:01:15.969> is<00:01:16.060> one<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.810> actually<00:01:17.170> one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
taking i think is one it's actually one

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.770 
taking i think is one it's actually one
noise<00:01:17.710> wave<00:01:17.979> but<00:01:18.820> I'm<00:01:18.939> then<00:01:19.149> doing<00:01:19.420> three

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
noise wave but I'm then doing three

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.690 
noise wave but I'm then doing three
different<00:01:20.079> kind<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.469> em<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.340> mouth<00:01:21.520> on<00:01:21.640> it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
different kind of em it's a mouth on it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.190 
different kind of em it's a mouth on it
to<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.359> know<00:01:22.450> make<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.750> totally<00:01:22.810> different

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
to you know make it totally different

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.920 
to you know make it totally different
and<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:24.369> basically<00:01:25.030> takes<00:01:25.359> it<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:25.630> makes<00:01:25.840> it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
and one basically takes it and makes it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.139 
and one basically takes it and makes it
very<00:01:26.140> kind<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.619> am<00:01:26.740> like<00:01:26.979> even<00:01:27.609> kind<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.090> like--

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
very kind of am like even kind of like--

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.609 
very kind of am like even kind of like--
hills<00:01:28.509> like<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:28.899> saw<00:01:29.049> in<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.140> first<00:01:29.320> videos

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
hills like you saw in the first videos

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.310 
hills like you saw in the first videos
and<00:01:29.859> that's<00:01:30.820> very<00:01:31.000> smooth<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:31.689> you<00:01:31.929> do<00:01:32.170> that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
and that's very smooth if you do that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.410 
and that's very smooth if you do that
it's<00:01:32.409> kind<00:01:32.469> of<00:01:32.560> boring<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.759> i<00:01:33.789> have<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.179> that

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
it's kind of boring so i have that that

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.929 
it's kind of boring so i have that that
i<00:01:34.450> mix<00:01:34.689> it<00:01:34.780> together<00:01:34.929> with<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:36.789> gives

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
i mix it together with a one that gives

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.340 
i mix it together with a one that gives
you<00:01:37.060> kind<00:01:37.179> of<00:01:37.270> general<00:01:37.630> slope<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.259> get

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
you kind of general slope so you get

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.349 
you kind of general slope so you get
like<00:01:38.469> higher<00:01:38.679> areas<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.219> lower<00:01:39.369> areas<00:01:39.789> which

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
like higher areas and lower areas which

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.510 
like higher areas and lower areas which
is<00:01:40.450> cool<00:01:40.630> sing<00:01:41.469> at<00:01:41.590> mountains<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.070> stuff<00:01:42.219> and

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
is cool sing at mountains and stuff and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.270 
is cool sing at mountains and stuff and
then<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:44.020> mix<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.320> with<00:01:44.469> an<00:01:44.560> extreme<00:01:44.950> one<00:01:45.159> and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
then it mix it with an extreme one and

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.349 
then it mix it with an extreme one and
the<00:01:45.340> extreme<00:01:45.609> one<00:01:45.729> basically<00:01:46.060> gives<00:01:46.240> you

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
the extreme one basically gives you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.419 
the extreme one basically gives you
these<00:01:46.509> kind<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.289> like<00:01:47.409> big<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:48.070> know<00:01:48.159> kind<00:01:48.399> of

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
these kind of like big you know kind of

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.520 
these kind of like big you know kind of
like<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:49.179> goes<00:01:49.390> quite<00:01:49.719> far<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:50.049> and<00:01:50.170> down<00:01:50.289> and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
like it goes quite far up and down and

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.260 
like it goes quite far up and down and
that<00:01:50.590> gives<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.460> these<00:01:51.549> hills<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.119> these

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
that gives you these hills and these

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.630 
that gives you these hills and these
rivers<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.810> stuff<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.100> yeah<00:01:54.219> i<00:01:54.249> mean<00:01:54.490> like

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
rivers and stuff so yeah i mean like

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.039 
rivers and stuff so yeah i mean like
it's<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.299> same<00:01:55.479> kind<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.659> world<00:01:55.840> gym<00:01:55.960> i'm

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
it's the same kind of world gym i'm

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's the same kind of world gym i'm
going<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.259> just<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.499> know<00:01:56.560> i<00:01:56.799> decide<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.219> i

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
going to just you know i decide that i

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.399 
going to just you know i decide that i
get<00:01:57.729> 0<00:01:57.759> is<00:01:58.299> sea<00:01:58.479> level<00:01:58.719> and<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.140> like<00:01:59.319> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
get 0 is sea level and so like the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.859 
get 0 is sea level and so like the
waters<00:01:59.679> at<00:01:59.829> 0<00:02:00.069> Nina<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:01.240> then<00:02:01.359> yeah<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:01.780> we

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
waters at 0 Nina and then yeah and so we

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.840 
waters at 0 Nina and then yeah and so we
have<00:02:01.960> sand<00:02:02.229> textures<00:02:02.979> again<00:02:03.219> placeholders

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
have sand textures again placeholders

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.359 
have sand textures again placeholders
don't<00:02:04.060> even<00:02:04.210> tell<00:02:04.359> me<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:05.380> yeah<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.590> know<00:02:05.649> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
don't even tell me so yeah I know and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.559 
don't even tell me so yeah I know and
also<00:02:06.609> you'll<00:02:06.819> notice<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:07.090> if<00:02:07.329> I<00:02:07.420> go<00:02:07.450> down

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
also you'll notice that if I go down

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.770 
also you'll notice that if I go down
close<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.649> water<00:02:09.460> here<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.540> sand

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
close to the water here that the sand

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.270 
close to the water here that the sand
the<00:02:11.140> water<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.710> first<00:02:11.890> block<00:02:12.130> that's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
the water is the first block that's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.900 
the water is the first block that's
actually<00:02:12.580> not

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
actually not

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.860 
actually not
block<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.440> know<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.560> about<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:16.840> 0

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
block it's you know it's about not 0

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.500 
block it's you know it's about not 0
point<00:02:17.170> nine<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> meter<00:02:19.150> instead<00:02:19.420> of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
point nine like of a meter instead of

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.780 
point nine like of a meter instead of
one<00:02:19.600> meter<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.620> am<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.130> Sun<00:02:21.280> comes<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.700> a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
one meter so am the Sun comes just a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
one meter so am the Sun comes just a
book<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.210> like<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.470> looks<00:02:23.590> nice<00:02:23.740> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
book of it like and it looks nice of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.170 
book of it like and it looks nice of
course<00:02:24.340> there's<00:02:24.520> no<00:02:24.550> water<00:02:24.760> physics<00:02:25.090> yet

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
course there's no water physics yet

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.540 
course there's no water physics yet
because<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.540> expect<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.370> don't<00:02:27.370> want

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because you expect that and don't want

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.650 
because you expect that and don't want
to<00:02:27.580> get<00:02:27.700> around<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.540> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
to get around to that we just do it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.170 
to get around to that we just do it
someday<00:02:28.900> randomly<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.770> water<00:02:30.730> physics<00:02:31.060> be

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
someday randomly and water physics be

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.530 
someday randomly and water physics be
very<00:02:31.330> basic<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:31.870> they<00:02:32.260> should<00:02:32.440> do<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:34.090> yeah<00:02:34.300> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
very basic but they should do but yeah I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.510 
very basic but they should do but yeah I
mean<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.170> might<00:02:35.260> notice<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
mean you might notice that the like the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.300 
mean you might notice that the like the
trees<00:02:36.820> are<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.270> using<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.140> still<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
trees are now using the I still have the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.210 
trees are now using the I still have the
code<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.360> old<00:02:40.390> like<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.930> know

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
code in for the old like you know

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.890 
code in for the old like you know
generation<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.090> trees<00:02:43.330> are<00:02:43.360> actually

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
generation and the trees are actually

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.930 
generation and the trees are actually
they're<00:02:44.530> using<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:44.950> levels<00:02:45.280> from<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.730> new

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
they're using the levels from the new

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.850 
they're using the levels from the new
generation<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.720> they're<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> ground<00:02:47.620> as

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
generation so they're on the ground as

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.920 
generation so they're on the ground as
they<00:02:47.890> should<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.940> distribution<00:02:49.660> is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
they should be but the distribution is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
they should be but the distribution is
from<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> old<00:02:50.620> generation<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.220> they're<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> bit

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
from the old generation so they're a bit

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.030 
from the old generation so they're a bit
weird<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.200> get<00:02:53.350> some<00:02:53.530> areas<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:53.800> lots

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
weird like you get some areas but lots

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.340 
weird like you get some areas but lots
and<00:02:54.220> somewhat<00:02:54.430> none<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:56.080> I'm<00:02:56.170> going<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
and somewhat none but I'm going to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.070 
and somewhat none but I'm going to
change<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:57.040> yeah<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.720> mean<00:02:58.840> from<00:02:58.990> the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
change that so yeah but mean from the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.150 
change that so yeah but mean from the
most<00:02:59.200> parts<00:02:59.470> working<00:02:59.680> quite<00:02:59.860> well<00:02:59.890> actually

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
most parts working quite well actually

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.730 
most parts working quite well actually
like<00:03:00.490> how<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> sand<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.750> water<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.650> know

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
like how the sand and water is you know

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.660 
like how the sand and water is you know
done<00:03:03.210> like<00:03:04.210> how<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.390> came<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:06.220> let's<00:03:06.520> even

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
done like how it came out and let's even

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.490 
done like how it came out and let's even
find<00:03:06.880> nice<00:03:06.970> area<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:08.050> one<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.290> first<00:03:08.320> times

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
find nice area so one of the first times

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.600 
find nice area so one of the first times
I<00:03:08.620> actually<00:03:08.770> just<00:03:08.950> run<00:03:09.130> around<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.370> world<00:03:09.520> me

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
I actually just run around the world me

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.420 
I actually just run around the world me
like<00:03:09.730> oh<00:03:09.790> that's<00:03:10.000> cool<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.980> fighting

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
like oh that's cool and fighting

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.730 
like oh that's cool and fighting

probably land here sorry feeds bit laggy

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.320 
probably land here sorry feeds bit laggy
fraps<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.310> really<00:03:15.580> killing<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.970> it's

fraps but am but yeah I'll look granted
the<00:03:22.390> way<00:03:22.450> I'm<00:03:22.570> doing<00:03:22.660> chunks<00:03:22.990> right<00:03:23.170> now<00:03:23.320> I'm

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
the way I'm doing chunks right now I'm

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.400 
the way I'm doing chunks right now I'm
loading<00:03:24.340> more<00:03:24.490> than<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.670> need<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.880> be<00:03:25.380> which<00:03:26.380> is

loading more than I need to be which is
am<00:03:26.860> killing<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.340> bit<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.690> forget<00:03:28.690> my<00:03:28.780> own

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
am killing a bit I forget my own

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.460 
am killing a bit I forget my own
controls<00:03:29.490> even<00:03:30.490> though<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.610> set<00:03:30.850> them<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:32.440> a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
controls even though I set them but a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.170 
controls even though I set them but a
match<00:03:32.860> yet<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.520> like<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.730> mean<00:03:33.880> like<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.060> get

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
match yet so do like I mean like you get

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.730 
match yet so do like I mean like you get
these<00:03:34.270> into<00:03:34.420> kind<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.690> nice<00:03:34.810> flat<00:03:35.110> areas<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
these into kind of nice flat areas and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.190 
these into kind of nice flat areas and
then<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.850> get<00:03:36.970> hills<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.750> then<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.930> get<00:03:38.020> like

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
then you get hills and then you get like

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.930 
then you get hills and then you get like
kind<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.470> big<00:03:38.770> water<00:03:39.250> areas<00:03:39.640> i<00:03:39.760> love

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
kind of like big water areas i love

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.270 
kind of like big water areas i love
little<00:03:40.150> islands<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.600> stuff<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.160> see

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
little islands and stuff like you see

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.190 
little islands and stuff like you see
the<00:03:42.340> way<00:03:42.400> that's<00:03:42.580> very<00:03:42.640> smooth<00:03:43.120> they<00:03:43.930> used<00:03:44.110> to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the way that's very smooth they used to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.690 
the way that's very smooth they used to
be<00:03:44.290> all<00:03:44.500> like<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.890> whereas<00:03:45.190> now<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.370> get

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
be all like that whereas now you get

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.540 
be all like that whereas now you get
them<00:03:45.850> they're<00:03:46.270> quite<00:03:46.510> varied<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:48.220> actually

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
them they're quite varied or actually

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.920 
them they're quite varied or actually
one<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.820> way<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.330> done<00:03:49.420> at<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.660> moment

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
one of the way it's done at the moment

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.140 
one of the way it's done at the moment
is<00:03:50.050> as<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.410> said<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.709> it's<00:03:51.310> one<00:03:51.640> noise<00:03:51.820> pattern

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
is as I said it's it's one noise pattern

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.790 
is as I said it's it's one noise pattern
but<00:03:52.360> it's<00:03:52.900> kind<00:03:53.050> of<00:03:53.080> manipulated<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.650> three

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
but it's kind of manipulated in three

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.650 
but it's kind of manipulated in three
different<00:03:53.950> ways<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:55.060> those<00:03:55.270> are<00:03:55.300> mixed

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
different ways and then those are mixed

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.960 
different ways and then those are mixed
together<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> averages<00:03:56.770> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
together I just get the averages and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.580 
together I just get the averages and
then<00:03:57.970> also<00:03:58.180> one<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.480> them<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.660> rotated<00:03:59.140> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
then also one of them is rotated the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.140 
then also one of them is rotated the
reason<00:03:59.860> for<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.250> try<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.520> avoid<00:04:00.760> kind

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
reason for that is to try and avoid kind

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.600 
reason for that is to try and avoid kind
of<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:02.320> straight<00:04:02.650> edges<00:04:02.950> like<00:04:03.489> you

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
of like really straight edges like you

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.680 
of like really straight edges like you
see<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:04.030> here<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.239> shaken<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.510> good

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
see this one here is a shaken a good

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.990 
see this one here is a shaken a good
example<00:04:05.050> that's<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.980> bit<00:04:06.220> long<00:04:06.459> for<00:04:06.489> one<00:04:06.880> edge

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
example that's a bit long for one edge

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.960 
example that's a bit long for one edge
it's<00:04:07.840> quite<00:04:08.140> long<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.500> straight<00:04:08.970> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
it's quite long and straight that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.400 
it's quite long and straight that
normally<00:04:10.420> won't<00:04:10.540> happen<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.050> at<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.230> same

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
normally won't happen but at the same

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.440 
normally won't happen but at the same
time<00:04:11.560> if<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.160> hadn't<00:04:12.459> rotated<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:12.910> one<00:04:13.120> wave

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
time if I hadn't rotated that one wave

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.640 
time if I hadn't rotated that one wave
it<00:04:13.630> would<00:04:13.720> happen<00:04:13.810> all<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.080> time<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.560> know

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it would happen all the time you know

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.530 
it would happen all the time you know
now<00:04:15.340> granted<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.850> could<00:04:15.970> probly<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.239> more<00:04:16.450> with

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
now granted I could probly do more with

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.789 
now granted I could probly do more with
the<00:04:16.630> rotation<00:04:16.959> really<00:04:17.140> rotating<00:04:17.440> one<00:04:17.590> layer

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
around with that but I said no it's

the way this is done because it means I

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.779 
the way this is done because it means I
can<00:04:35.749> you<00:04:36.409> know<00:04:36.529> kind<00:04:36.620> of<00:04:36.710> tweak<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:37.129> as<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.520> like

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
can you know kind of tweak it as I like

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.309 
can you know kind of tweak it as I like
and<00:04:37.999> get<00:04:38.419> those<00:04:38.509> also<00:04:38.719> want<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.979> yeah<00:04:40.789> and

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
and get those also want and yeah and

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.450 
and get those also want and yeah and
it's<00:04:42.319> actually<00:04:42.379> I<00:04:42.590> think<00:04:42.620> it's<00:04:42.770> faster<00:04:43.310> than

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
it's actually I think it's faster than

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.739 
it's actually I think it's faster than
the<00:04:43.580> old<00:04:43.819> generation<00:04:44.210> used<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.539> be<00:04:44.599> which<00:04:44.719> is

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:44.749 
the old generation used to be which is

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.409 
the old generation used to be which is
nice<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.610> think<00:04:46.610> what's<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:46.819> only<00:04:47.090> real

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
nice I think what's the only real

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.809 
nice I think what's the only real
performance<00:04:47.870> issue<00:04:48.050> right<00:04:48.259> now<00:04:48.319> is<00:04:48.819> they're

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
performance issue right now is they're

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.920 
performance issue right now is they're
entering<00:04:50.090> is<00:04:50.240> going<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.449> be<00:04:50.509> coming<00:04:50.689> in<00:04:50.749> as<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
entering is going to be coming in as you

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.489 
entering is going to be coming in as you
now<00:04:51.080> because<00:04:52.009> of<00:04:52.189> the<00:04:52.340> water<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.050> also<00:04:54.050> I'm

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:54.499 
now because of the water and also I'm

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:56.769 
now because of the water and also I'm
this<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.580> actually<00:04:55.849> two<00:04:55.999> chunks<00:04:56.389> like<00:04:56.599> the

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:56.779 
this is actually two chunks like the

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.209 
this is actually two chunks like the
water<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.139> kind<00:04:57.259> of<00:04:57.379> in<00:04:57.499> one<00:04:57.650> chunk<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.099> these

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
water is kind of in one chunk and these

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.010 
water is kind of in one chunk and these
islands<00:04:58.699> are<00:04:58.759> in<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:58.879> different<00:04:59.060> chunk<00:04:59.330> that's

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
islands are in a different chunk that's

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.570 
islands are in a different chunk that's
a<00:05:00.169> bad<00:05:00.379> way<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.620> do<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.919> that's<00:05:01.039> really<00:05:01.340> killing

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
a bad way to do it that's really killing

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.800 
a bad way to do it that's really killing
performance<00:05:02.029> for<00:05:02.150> no<00:05:02.210> reason<00:05:02.479> so<00:05:02.569> i<00:05:02.599> might<00:05:02.779> as

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
performance for no reason so i might as

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.869 
performance for no reason so i might as
you<00:05:02.900> move<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.229> water<00:05:03.409> up<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.740> bit<00:05:03.889> like<00:05:04.699> kind<00:05:04.789> of

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
you move the water up a bit like kind of

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.600 
you move the water up a bit like kind of
halfway<00:05:05.060> up<00:05:05.270> with<00:05:05.360> chunk<00:05:05.539> an<00:05:06.319> aussie<00:05:06.710> see<00:05:07.490> like

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
halfway up with chunk an aussie see like

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.679 
halfway up with chunk an aussie see like
I<00:05:07.699> like<00:05:07.819> this<00:05:07.909> area<00:05:08.029> you<00:05:08.240> know<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.599> gonna

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
I like this area you know it's gonna

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.300 
I like this area you know it's gonna
cool<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.409> have<00:05:09.529> these<00:05:09.680> little<00:05:09.770> islands<00:05:10.159> and

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
cool you have these little islands and

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.200 
cool you have these little islands and
stuff<00:05:10.460> yeah<00:05:11.229> it's<00:05:12.229> coo<00:05:12.789> but<00:05:13.789> yeah<00:05:13.909> so<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.120> think

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
stuff yeah it's coo but yeah so I think

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.029 
stuff yeah it's coo but yeah so I think
and<00:05:14.539> what<00:05:15.139> I<00:05:15.169> really<00:05:15.349> we<00:05:15.409> need<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.680> do<00:05:15.800> now<00:05:16.009> is

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
and what I really we need to do now is

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.860 
and what I really we need to do now is
obviously<00:05:16.969> I<00:05:17.029> need<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.270> optimize<00:05:17.419> a<00:05:17.599> bit<00:05:17.719> more

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
obviously I need to optimize a bit more

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.290 
obviously I need to optimize a bit more
but<00:05:18.050> as<00:05:18.139> well<00:05:18.289> and<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:19.639> really<00:05:19.759> want<00:05:19.969> to<00:05:20.089> do<00:05:20.180> the

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
but as well and I really want to do the

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.510 
but as well and I really want to do the
player<00:05:20.569> physics<00:05:20.900> again<00:05:21.110> because<00:05:21.740> right<00:05:22.069> now<00:05:22.099> I

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
player physics again because right now I

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.550 
player physics again because right now I
kind<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.300> made<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.449> catch-all<00:05:23.930> kind<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.319> method

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
kind of made a catch-all kind of method

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.379 
kind of made a catch-all kind of method
for<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.770> physics<00:05:25.069> for<00:05:25.249> like<00:05:25.370> all<00:05:25.490> mobs<00:05:25.729> which

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
for the physics for like all mobs which

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.019 
for the physics for like all mobs which
works<00:05:26.749> but<00:05:27.020> it's<00:05:27.110> quite<00:05:27.259> slow<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.919> that's<00:05:28.099> the

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
works but it's quite slow and that's the

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.420 
works but it's quite slow and that's the
problem<00:05:29.300> there<00:05:29.659> is<00:05:29.689> that<00:05:29.900> if<00:05:30.259> you<00:05:30.560> if<00:05:31.250> your

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
problem there is that if you if your

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.369 
problem there is that if you if your
performance<00:05:31.879> tanks<00:05:32.240> at<00:05:32.360> all<00:05:32.509> you<00:05:33.110> start

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
performance tanks at all you start

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.570 
performance tanks at all you start
falling<00:05:33.740> through<00:05:33.860> blocks<00:05:34.069> that's<00:05:34.339> annoying

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
falling through blocks that's annoying

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.459 
falling through blocks that's annoying
now<00:05:35.419> it's<00:05:35.569> not<00:05:35.689> really<00:05:35.870> bad<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.139> fault<00:05:36.319> you're

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
now it's not really bad you fault you're

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.869 
now it's not really bad you fault you're
like<00:05:36.560> one<00:05:36.680> block<00:05:36.830> me<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.189> still<00:05:37.460> get<00:05:37.580> back<00:05:37.729> but

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
like one block me and still get back but

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.869 
like one block me and still get back but
it's<00:05:38.810> annoying<00:05:39.020> it's<00:05:39.439> really<00:05:39.620> annoying<00:05:39.889> you

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
it's annoying it's really annoying you

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.959 
it's annoying it's really annoying you
want<00:05:41.029> to<00:05:41.089> be<00:05:41.180> smooth<00:05:41.360> so<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.819> obviously<00:05:43.819> I'm

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
want to be smooth so and obviously I'm

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.760 
want to be smooth so and obviously I'm
trying<00:05:44.149> to<00:05:44.210> avoid<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.629> it's<00:05:45.349> just<00:05:45.500> gonna<00:05:45.589> run

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
trying to avoid that it's just gonna run

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.010 
trying to avoid that it's just gonna run
around<00:05:45.830> for<00:05:46.009> a<00:05:46.039> while<00:05:46.449> but<00:05:47.449> am<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.810> actually

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
around for a while but am I actually

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.529 
around for a while but am I actually
walk<00:05:48.289> quite<00:05:48.500> slowly<00:05:48.680> ah<00:05:49.270> script<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.449> its

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
walk quite slowly ah script and its

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.920 
walk quite slowly ah script and its
flight<00:05:50.719> refer<00:05:51.080> flying<00:05:51.349> it's<00:05:51.560> faster<00:05:52.719> but<00:05:53.719> am

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
flight refer flying it's faster but am

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.510 
flight refer flying it's faster but am
but<00:05:54.199> yeah<00:05:54.319> I<00:05:54.349> want<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.800> fix<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:55.099> physics<00:05:55.370> I'm

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
but yeah I want to fix the physics I'm

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.159 
but yeah I want to fix the physics I'm
basically<00:05:55.849> gonna<00:05:55.969> put<00:05:56.149> in<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.389> special

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
basically gonna put in a special

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.350 
basically gonna put in a special
specific<00:05:58.129> physics<00:05:58.430> model<00:05:58.699> for<00:05:58.879> like<00:05:59.000> one

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
specific physics model for like one

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.179 
specific physics model for like one
block<00:05:59.569> size<00:06:00.080> creatures<00:06:00.529> and<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.830> block<00:06:01.009> size

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:01.189 
block size creatures and to block size

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.889 
block size creatures and to block size
creatures<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:02.089> that<00:06:02.210> should<00:06:02.360> do<00:06:02.449> most<00:06:02.659> mobs

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:02.899 
creatures and that should do most mobs

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:04.360 
creatures and that should do most mobs
and<00:06:03.110> then<00:06:03.680> everything<00:06:03.860> else<00:06:04.009> can<00:06:04.189> use<00:06:04.279> the

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
and then everything else can use the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.589 
and then everything else can use the
catch-all<00:06:04.639> method<00:06:04.969> so<00:06:05.120> that's<00:06:05.270> just<00:06:05.360> still

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
catch-all method so that's just still

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.719 
catch-all method so that's just still
work<00:06:05.719> ooh<00:06:05.899> that's<00:06:06.169> nice<00:06:06.370> it's<00:06:07.370> being<00:06:07.520> flat

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
work ooh that's nice it's being flat

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.279 
work ooh that's nice it's being flat
area<00:06:07.969> I<00:06:08.860> love<00:06:09.860> that<00:06:09.889> it's<00:06:10.039> so<00:06:10.189> varied<00:06:10.639> like

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
area I love that it's so varied like

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.719 
area I love that it's so varied like
it's<00:06:12.289> not<00:06:12.439> all<00:06:12.620> Hills<00:06:12.889> you<00:06:13.069> know<00:06:13.129> now<00:06:13.580> as<00:06:13.699> I

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
it's not all Hills you know now as I

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.670 
it's not all Hills you know now as I
said<00:06:13.879> I<00:06:13.969> could<00:06:14.089> still<00:06:14.300> do<00:06:14.479> like<00:06:14.689> I<00:06:14.990> couldn't

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
said I could still do like I couldn't

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.679 
said I could still do like I couldn't
mix<00:06:15.830> this<00:06:15.979> with<00:06:16.159> like<00:06:16.490> one<00:06:16.789> wave<00:06:16.969> that's<00:06:17.479> like

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:17.689 
mix this with like one wave that's like

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.260 
mix this with like one wave that's like
em<00:06:17.990> or<00:06:18.349> one<00:06:18.860> layer<00:06:19.039> that's<00:06:19.279> like<00:06:19.939> really

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
em or one layer that's like really

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.850 
em or one layer that's like really
spread<00:06:21.229> out<00:06:21.259> like<00:06:23.199> if<00:06:24.199> I<00:06:24.319> can<00:06:24.439> try<00:06:24.589> to<00:06:24.649> explain

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
spread out like if I can try to explain

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.990 
spread out like if I can try to explain
this<00:06:24.979> a<00:06:25.069> little<00:06:25.129> bit<00:06:25.339> how<00:06:25.430> it<00:06:25.520> works<00:06:25.699> the<00:06:25.879> mouth

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
this a little bit how it works the mouth

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.860 
this a little bit how it works the mouth
mind<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:27.310> basically<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.729> can<00:06:29.419> kind<00:06:29.599> of<00:06:29.659> chew<00:06:29.839> in

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
mind it basically I can kind of chew in

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.629 
mind it basically I can kind of chew in
the<00:06:30.050> wave<00:06:30.199> so<00:06:30.589> that<00:06:30.860> it's<00:06:31.039> more<00:06:31.129> spread<00:06:31.610> out

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
the wave so that it's more spread out

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.600 
the wave so that it's more spread out
you<00:06:32.389> know<00:06:32.479> more<00:06:32.750> flat<00:06:32.960> but<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.129> then<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.399> can

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
you know more flat but it and then I can

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.990 
you know more flat but it and then I can
also<00:06:34.789> tune<00:06:35.180> how<00:06:35.419> kind<00:06:35.690> of<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.899> jacket<00:06:36.349> it<00:06:36.440> is<00:06:37.000> so

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
also tune how kind of a jacket it is so

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.519 
also tune how kind of a jacket it is so
like<00:06:38.180> I<00:06:38.269> could<00:06:38.449> make<00:06:38.599> an<00:06:38.750> area<00:06:38.930> where

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
like I could make an area where

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.289 
like I could make an area where
it<00:06:39.709> varies<00:06:40.159> in<00:06:40.339> height<00:06:40.489> a<00:06:40.519> lot<00:06:40.789> but<00:06:41.029> it's<00:06:41.149> still

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:41.299 
it varies in height a lot but it's still

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:42.729 
it varies in height a lot but it's still
quite<00:06:41.569> you<00:06:41.749> know<00:06:41.779> flash<00:06:42.259> doesn't<00:06:42.589> actually

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739 
quite you know flash doesn't actually

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.649 
quite you know flash doesn't actually
work<00:06:42.979> like<00:06:43.159> it's<00:06:43.279> not<00:06:43.399> very<00:06:43.489> jagged<00:06:43.699> or<00:06:44.089> I<00:06:44.449> can

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
work like it's not very jagged or I can

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:45.639 
work like it's not very jagged or I can
make<00:06:44.749> an<00:06:44.839> area<00:06:44.989> where<00:06:45.229> it<00:06:45.319> actually<00:06:45.439> it's

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:45.649 
make an area where it actually it's

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.079 
make an area where it actually it's
quite<00:06:45.799> checking<00:06:46.129> it's<00:06:46.309> just<00:06:46.429> it's<00:06:46.639> not<00:06:46.879> crazy

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.089 
quite checking it's just it's not crazy

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.389 
quite checking it's just it's not crazy
you<00:06:47.389> know<00:06:47.649> but<00:06:48.649> so<00:06:48.859> when<00:06:48.979> you<00:06:49.039> kind<00:06:49.129> of<00:06:49.249> tweak

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:49.399 
you know but so when you kind of tweak

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.159 
you know but so when you kind of tweak
those<00:06:49.549> two<00:06:49.789> that<00:06:49.969> gives<00:06:50.329> you<00:06:50.449> different<00:06:50.629> and

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
those two that gives you different and

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.679 
those two that gives you different and
results<00:06:51.849> so<00:06:52.849> as<00:06:52.999> I<00:06:53.089> said<00:06:53.179> like<00:06:53.329> this<00:06:53.539> whole

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
results so as I said like this whole

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.169 
results so as I said like this whole
world<00:06:53.959> is<00:06:54.079> coming<00:06:54.229> from<00:06:54.349> one<00:06:54.649> like<00:06:55.579> random

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:56.179 
world is coming from one like random

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:58.749 
world is coming from one like random
wave<00:06:56.299> pattern<00:06:56.629> basically<00:06:57.369> that's<00:06:58.369> the<00:06:58.549> only

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
wave pattern basically that's the only

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.889 
wave pattern basically that's the only
thing<00:06:58.819> that's<00:06:58.999> actually<00:06:59.209> generate<00:06:59.449> the<00:06:59.749> rest

00:06:59.889 --> 00:06:59.899 
thing that's actually generate the rest

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.889 
thing that's actually generate the rest
is<00:06:59.989> just<00:07:00.019> you<00:07:00.289> know<00:07:00.409> good<00:07:00.889> math<00:07:01.069> on<00:07:01.219> it<00:07:01.809> but<00:07:02.809> I'd

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:02.899 
is just you know good math on it but I'd

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:03.939 
is just you know good math on it but I'd
be<00:07:02.989> interested<00:07:03.139> to<00:07:03.349> see<00:07:03.499> what<00:07:03.589> I<00:07:03.619> can<00:07:03.679> do<00:07:03.799> this

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
be interested to see what I can do this

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.619 
be interested to see what I can do this
now<00:07:04.129> if<00:07:04.609> I<00:07:04.729> make<00:07:04.879> some<00:07:04.999> cool<00:07:05.179> mountains<00:07:05.539> or

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
now if I make some cool mountains or

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.749 
now if I make some cool mountains or
stuff<00:07:05.809> I<00:07:05.899> might<00:07:06.049> show<00:07:06.319> it<00:07:06.349> off<00:07:06.609> but<00:07:07.609> yeah<00:07:07.729> I

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
stuff I might show it off but yeah I

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.679 
stuff I might show it off but yeah I
really<00:07:07.849> just<00:07:08.029> wanna<00:07:08.149> make<00:07:08.209> it<00:07:08.269> even<00:07:08.449> give<00:07:08.629> you

like them and see be you know really

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.259 
like them and see be you know really
into<00:07:13.489> them<00:07:13.579> in<00:07:13.699> the<00:07:13.759> moment<00:07:13.999> so<00:07:14.089> I<00:07:14.119> just

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:14.269 
into them in the moment so I just

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:15.339 
into them in the moment so I just
thought<00:07:14.389> I'd<00:07:14.449> show<00:07:14.629> it<00:07:14.659> off<00:07:14.809> thought<00:07:15.229> of

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349 
thought I'd show it off thought of

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.429 
thought I'd show it off thought of
school<00:07:15.529> and<00:07:15.969> then<00:07:16.969> yeah<00:07:17.329> I'll<00:07:18.019> some<00:07:18.259> kind<00:07:18.409> of

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:18.439 
school and then yeah I'll some kind of

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.109 
school and then yeah I'll some kind of
the<00:07:18.529> setting<00:07:18.739> through<00:07:18.889> the<00:07:19.069> water<00:07:19.249> I<00:07:19.519> kind<00:07:20.029> of

00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:20.119 
the setting through the water I kind of

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:22.809 
the setting through the water I kind of
like<00:07:20.359> this<00:07:20.629> look<00:07:20.929> it's<00:07:21.199> weird<00:07:21.559> but<00:07:22.369> there's

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:22.819 
like this look it's weird but there's

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.219 
like this look it's weird but there's
something<00:07:23.089> about<00:07:23.269> like<00:07:23.599> the<00:07:23.719> bright<00:07:23.929> sound

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229 
something about like the bright sound

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.199 
something about like the bright sound
and<00:07:24.499> like<00:07:24.679> the<00:07:24.859> kind<00:07:25.669> of<00:07:25.699> the<00:07:25.789> plain<00:07:25.939> blue

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:26.209 
and like the kind of the plain blue

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.939 
and like the kind of the plain blue
which<00:07:26.359> just<00:07:26.569> looks<00:07:26.659> would<00:07:26.839> be<00:07:26.929> nice<00:07:27.109> to<00:07:27.259> me<00:07:27.379> it

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
which just looks would be nice to me it

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.519 
which just looks would be nice to me it
doesn't<00:07:28.159> suit<00:07:28.369> the<00:07:28.519> textures<00:07:28.849> at<00:07:28.939> all<00:07:29.289> but<00:07:30.289> am

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:30.529 
doesn't suit the textures at all but am

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:33.639 
doesn't suit the textures at all but am
looks<00:07:31.099> kind<00:07:31.249> of<00:07:31.279> cool<00:07:32.019> so<00:07:33.019> no<00:07:33.259> other<00:07:33.409> side<00:07:33.619> of

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:33.649 
looks kind of cool so no other side of

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:35.889 
looks kind of cool so no other side of
the<00:07:33.739> graphical<00:07:34.069> style<00:07:34.219> later<00:07:34.629> would<00:07:35.629> ya<00:07:35.779> I

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:35.899 
the graphical style later would ya I

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:38.439 
the graphical style later would ya I
think<00:07:36.079> for<00:07:36.229> now<00:07:36.319> guys<00:07:36.469> that's<00:07:36.889> not<00:07:37.449> i'll

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:38.449 
think for now guys that's not i'll

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:39.489

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:48.919 
actual you like to render text with so

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.239 
actual you like to render text with so
i'll<00:07:49.039> see<00:07:49.219> I<00:07:49.369> know<00:07:50.269> any<00:07:51.110> guys<00:07:51.259> in<00:07:51.559> the<00:07:52.069> meantime
