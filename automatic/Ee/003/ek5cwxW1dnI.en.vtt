instead<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> clear<00:01:18.960> gel<00:01:18.990> we're<00:01:19.320> actually

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
instead of clear gel we're actually

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
instead of clear gel we're actually
going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> start<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> colored<00:01:20.850> gel

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
going to start off with a colored gel
and<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> put<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> base

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and I'm going to put this into the base

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.620 
and I'm going to put this into the base
spreading<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.100> evenly<00:01:23.460> making<00:01:24.270> sure<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
spreading it out evenly making sure that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
spreading it out evenly making sure that
you<00:01:24.750> touch<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> frame<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> guys<00:01:26.369> want

you touch the frame and if you guys want

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
you touch the frame and if you guys want
you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.880> actually<00:01:27.000> skip<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> last<00:01:28.229> step

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you can actually skip to the last step

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
you can actually skip to the last step
which<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> add<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.400> builder<00:01:29.790> gel<00:01:29.970> however

layers again we're going to take our
builder<00:01:53.520> gel<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> we're<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> form<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
builder gel and we're going to form a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
builder gel and we're going to form a
dome<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.369> tip<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> guys

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
dome and just a little tip for you guys

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.490 
dome and just a little tip for you guys
if<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.540> completely<00:01:57.719> confident<00:01:58.380> in

if you're not completely confident in

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
if you're not completely confident in
sculpting<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.549> flip<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.030> piece

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
sculpting then you can flip this piece

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
sculpting then you can flip this piece
over<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.380> gravity<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:01.829> create<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.189> arch

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
over and the gravity will create an arch

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
over and the gravity will create an arch
for<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.060> mentioned<00:02:03.360> before<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.930> you

for you and as I mentioned before if you
just<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> add<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> color<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.280> can

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
just want to add a color then you can

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
to use this small circular motion that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.610 
to use this small circular motion that
I'm<00:02:44.520> showing<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.820> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> side<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I'm showing you on the side and this is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.170 
I'm showing you on the side and this is
going<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> allow<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.160> pick<00:02:47.460> up<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.730> lot<00:02:48.000> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
going to allow you to pick up a lot of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.270 
going to allow you to pick up a lot of
build<00:02:48.420> your<00:02:48.480> gel<00:02:48.720> at<00:02:48.870> once<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.440> knew<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.100> was

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
build your gel at once I knew I was

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
build your gel at once I knew I was
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.640> hands<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> way<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.240> you

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
going to get my hands in the way and you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.090 
going to get my hands in the way and you
wouldn't<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.660> able<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.870> see<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.830> was

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
wouldn't be able to see it so I was

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.310 
wouldn't be able to see it so I was
prepared<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.080> drop

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
prepared and then you just want to drop

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.680 
prepared and then you just want to drop
that<00:02:55.530> pearl<00:02:55.770> into<00:02:56.160> an<00:02:56.280> oval<00:02:56.640> shape<00:02:56.880> using<00:02:57.540> that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
that pearl into an oval shape using that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.060 
that pearl into an oval shape using that
same<00:02:57.900> circular<00:02:58.200> motion<00:02:58.710> that<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:58.950> normally

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
same circular motion that you normally

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.030 
same circular motion that you normally
use<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.790> again<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.750> turn<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.050> over<00:03:01.320> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
use and again you can turn this over to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.130 
use and again you can turn this over to
make<00:03:02.400> sure<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.940> nice<00:03:03.150> rounded

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
make sure that you get a nice rounded

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.960 
make sure that you get a nice rounded
arch<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.740> middle<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.520> now<00:03:05.640> I'm<00:03:05.820> actually

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
arch in the middle so now I'm actually

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.880 
arch in the middle so now I'm actually
going<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.300> apply<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.540> second<00:03:07.110> layer<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.410> gel<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
going to apply a second layer of gel and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.530 
going to apply a second layer of gel and
I'm<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.280> reinforcing<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:08.970> shape<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.330> I

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
I'm kind of reinforcing the shape that I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.540 
I'm kind of reinforcing the shape that I
just<00:03:09.810> created<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:10.680> also<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:11.070> into<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
just created but I'm also going into the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.190 
just created but I'm also going into the
wet<00:03:11.760> gel<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.270> black<00:03:12.600> color<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.110> I'm

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
wet gel with a black color and I'm

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.350 
wet gel with a black color and I'm
creating<00:03:13.620> my<00:03:13.650> veining<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.760> reason<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.150> this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
creating my veining the reason I do this

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.450 
creating my veining the reason I do this
in<00:03:15.570> two<00:03:15.660> stages<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.410> because<00:03:16.770> if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.190> apply

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
in two stages is because if you apply

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.850 
in two stages is because if you apply
too<00:03:17.520> much<00:03:17.700> gel<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.270> one<00:03:18.450> time<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.990> may<00:03:19.440> not<00:03:19.620> cure

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
too much gel at one time it may not cure

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.800 
too much gel at one time it may not cure
all<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.100> way<00:03:20.310> through<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.910> possibly<00:03:21.090> wrinkle

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
all the way through and possibly wrinkle

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.770 
all the way through and possibly wrinkle
or<00:03:22.080> still<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.010> some<00:03:23.340> wet<00:03:23.490> areas<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.750> a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
or still have some wet areas so as a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.030 
or still have some wet areas so as a
last<00:03:24.960> step<00:03:25.200> again<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.890> apply

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
last step again you're going to apply

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.160 
last step again you're going to apply
your<00:03:26.100> top<00:03:26.400> gel<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.700> cure<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.050> have

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
your top gel and cure and if you do have

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.480 
your top gel and cure and if you do have
any<00:03:28.320> small<00:03:28.500> imperfections<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.340> always

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
any small imperfections you can always

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.510 
any small imperfections you can always
shape<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.030> with<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.300> nail<00:03:30.420> file<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.520> we're

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
shape it up with the nail file and we're

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.070 
shape it up with the nail file and we're
done<00:03:32.640> guys<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.420> figured<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.930> guys<00:03:33.960> might

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
done guys but I figured you guys might

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.050 
done guys but I figured you guys might
want<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.530> see<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> little<00:03:34.980> demo<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.550> if<00:03:36.000> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
want to see a little demo and if you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.240 
want to see a little demo and if you
guys<00:03:36.210> remember<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.810> while<00:03:37.020> back<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.470> posted<00:03:38.010> some

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
guys remember a while back I posted some

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.100 
guys remember a while back I posted some
Japanese<00:03:38.670> inspired<00:03:38.970> nails<00:03:39.450> where<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.810> had<00:03:40.080> a

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
Japanese inspired nails where I had a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.340 
Japanese inspired nails where I had a
lot<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> 3d<00:03:40.920> art<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.550> just<00:03:42.300> clear<00:03:42.750> natural

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
lot of 3d art on just clear natural

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.800 
lot of 3d art on just clear natural
nails<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:45.150> guys<00:03:45.300> were<00:03:45.420> curious<00:03:45.690> how<00:03:45.780> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
nails and you guys were curious how I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.810 
nails and you guys were curious how I
got<00:03:46.110> them<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.950> kind<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.460> little<00:03:47.730> bit

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
got them so this is kind of a little bit

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.640 
got them so this is kind of a little bit
of<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.000> recreation<00:03:48.660> even<00:03:49.320> though<00:03:49.440> not

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
of a recreation even though not

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860 
of a recreation even though not
literally<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.520> all<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:50.640> did<00:03:50.760> was<00:03:51.030> apply<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.420> clear

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
literally so all I did was apply a clear

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.990 
literally so all I did was apply a clear
base<00:03:52.080> gel<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.470> my<00:03:52.590> natural<00:03:52.980> nails<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:53.970> I

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
base gel to my natural nails and then I

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.880 
base gel to my natural nails and then I
applied<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> little<00:03:54.660> bit<00:03:54.810> more<00:03:55.050> clear<00:03:55.380> gel<00:03:55.590> to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
applied a little bit more clear gel to

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.700 
applied a little bit more clear gel to
adhere<00:03:56.550> my<00:03:57.060> stones<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.570> my<00:03:57.630> 3d<00:03:57.960> art<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.410> then

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
adhere my stones and my 3d art and then
