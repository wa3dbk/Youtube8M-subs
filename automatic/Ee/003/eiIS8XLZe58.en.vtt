in this video I'm going to walk through
a<00:00:13.980> very<00:00:14.219> simple<00:00:14.759> program<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> 2-dimensional

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a very simple program of a 2-dimensional

job shop arena but first I want to talk
a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.759> bit<00:00:32.969> about<00:00:33.000> how<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.630> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
a little bit about how would you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.510 
a little bit about how would you
traditionally<00:00:34.530> process<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:36.149> CAD<00:00:36.360> cam

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
traditionally process that with CAD cam

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
traditionally process that with CAD cam
many<00:00:38.520> shops<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.239> who<00:00:39.390> say<00:00:39.629> I'll<00:00:39.960> never

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
many shops out there who say I'll never

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
many shops out there who say I'll never
use<00:00:40.350> conversational<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.940> CAD

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
use conversational because I have CAD

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
use conversational because I have CAD
cam<00:00:42.870> packages<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.040> programmers<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
cam packages I have programmers and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
cam packages I have programmers and
that's<00:00:45.719> fine<00:00:45.989> we've<00:00:46.800> said<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.160> other<00:00:47.370> videos

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that's fine we've said in other videos

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.500 
that's fine we've said in other videos
we<00:00:47.850> don't<00:00:48.300> try<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:49.910> convert<00:00:50.910> everybody<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we don't try to convert everybody to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.060 
we don't try to convert everybody to
conversational<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> take<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
conversational but I do want to take a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.790 
conversational but I do want to take a
minute<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> show<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:53.940> something<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.480> this

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
minute to show how something like this

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
minute to show how something like this
could<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.920> beneficial<00:00:56.640> done<00:00:57.239> on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
could be beneficial done on

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
could be beneficial done on
conversational<00:00:58.020> control<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
conversational control so here we have a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
conversational control so here we have a
screen<00:01:00.480> shot<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:01.109> master<00:01:01.530> cam<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.280> insert

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
screen shot from master cam but insert

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
screen shot from master cam but insert
your<00:01:02.969> favorite<00:01:03.149> cam<00:01:03.480> system<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.110> really

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
your favorite cam system here it really

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.340

the<00:01:15.030> shop<00:01:15.630> environment<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.290> capable<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> going

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the shop environment is capable of going

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880 
the shop environment is capable of going
to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.600> CAD<00:01:18.600> station<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> programming<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to the CAD station and programming the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
to the CAD station and programming the
part<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> few<00:01:21.150> guys<00:01:21.330> waiting<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
part so you have a few guys waiting on a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
part so you have a few guys waiting on a
couple<00:01:22.350> other<00:01:22.650> people<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> create<00:01:23.490> parts<00:01:24.030> now

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
couple other people to create parts now

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.940 
couple other people to create parts now
there<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.960> definitely<00:01:25.290> parts<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.770> there

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
there are definitely parts out there

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.160 
there are definitely parts out there
where<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.520> necessary

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
where that is necessary

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.060 
where that is necessary

what-have-you<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.689> also<00:01:30.840> very

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
what-have-you but there's also very

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
what-have-you but there's also very
simple<00:01:31.439> geometry<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> have

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
simple geometry like the one we have

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
simple geometry like the one we have
here<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.509> there's<00:01:33.689> no<00:01:33.810> need<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.409> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
here or there's no need for your

here or there's no need for your
operators<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> wait<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.329> guy<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> cam

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
to make to the program you have to go

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.609 
to make to the program you have to go
back<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:48.090> camp<00:01:48.570> programmer<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.380> has

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
back to the camp programmer and he has

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.660 
back to the camp programmer and he has
to<00:01:49.770> reprogram<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to reprogram it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
to reprogram it
I<00:01:50.700> can't<00:01:51.270> move<00:01:51.479> operations<00:01:51.869> around<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
I can't move operations around and so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.910 
I can't move operations around and so
forth

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.470 

and<00:01:57.920> where<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.220> herckel<00:01:58.520> advantage<00:01:59.000> comes<00:01:59.270> in

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
and where the herckel advantage comes in

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.510 
and where the herckel advantage comes in
here<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.440> conversational<00:02:01.160> control

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
here is with the conversational control

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520 
here is with the conversational control
being<00:02:01.760> used<00:02:02.030> at<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.450> floor<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.020> conjunction

in this case the 12 o'clock position

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.670 
in this case the 12 o'clock position
three<00:05:38.090> o'clock<00:05:38.360> would<00:05:38.570> be<00:05:38.630> zero<00:05:38.990> I'm<00:05:39.410> going<00:05:39.560> to

three o'clock would be zero I'm going to

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.129 
three o'clock would be zero I'm going to
put<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.919> first<00:05:40.190> hole<00:05:40.460> at<00:05:40.729> ninety<00:05:41.300> degrees<00:05:41.330> the

put the first hole at ninety degrees the

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.510 
put the first hole at ninety degrees the
reason<00:05:42.410> that's<00:05:42.500> important<00:05:43.039> is<00:05:43.130> because<00:05:43.340> I

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
reason that's important is because I

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.370 
reason that's important is because I
need<00:05:43.849> to<00:05:43.880> know<00:05:44.120> which<00:05:44.389> hole<00:05:44.660> is<00:05:44.690> number<00:05:45.139> one

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
need to know which hole is number one

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.860 
need to know which hole is number one
because<00:05:46.280> counting<00:05:46.880> from<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.599> position

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
because counting from that position

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.620 
because counting from that position
counterclockwise<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:49.340> have<00:05:49.520> holes<00:05:49.789> one<00:05:50.180> two

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
counterclockwise I have holes one two

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.450 
counterclockwise I have holes one two
three<00:05:51.169> four<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.800> so<00:05:51.889> on

hole in this eighth hole bolt circle I
do<00:05:59.300> not<00:05:59.599> need<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:00.710> simply<00:06:01.010> put<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.490> Skip

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
do not need so I simply put in the Skip

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.210 
do not need so I simply put in the Skip
list<00:06:02.060> number<00:06:02.539> eight<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.620> can<00:06:03.770> see<00:06:03.979> that

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
list number eight and you can see that

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.290 
list number eight and you can see that
it<00:06:04.340> Oh<00:06:04.490> mittens<00:06:06.639> early

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.600 

and<00:06:10.390> that<00:06:11.230> was<00:06:11.350> very<00:06:11.530> easy<00:06:11.800> to<00:06:12.040> walk<00:06:12.190> through

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
and that was very easy to walk through

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.630 
and that was very easy to walk through
well<00:06:13.570> now<00:06:13.840> as<00:06:14.200> I<00:06:14.590> mentioned<00:06:14.980> with<00:06:15.100> the<00:06:15.130> CAD<00:06:15.370> cam

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
well now as I mentioned with the CAD cam

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.730 
well now as I mentioned with the CAD cam
I<00:06:15.790> don't<00:06:15.970> have<00:06:16.120> much<00:06:16.330> flexibility<00:06:17.050> I<00:06:17.140> can't<00:06:17.530> go

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
I don't have much flexibility I can't go

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.070 
I don't have much flexibility I can't go
in<00:06:17.920> and<00:06:18.160> rearrange<00:06:18.730> processes<00:06:19.450> I<00:06:19.600> can't<00:06:19.870> use

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
in and rearrange processes I can't use

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.900 
in and rearrange processes I can't use
things<00:06:20.320> that<00:06:20.440> I've<00:06:20.620> already<00:06:20.800> programmed<00:06:21.130> to

just cut copy and paste where I want to

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.640 
just cut copy and paste where I want to
put<00:06:24.010> them<00:06:24.190> with<00:06:25.000> conversational<00:06:25.870> we're<00:06:26.530> able

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.300 
put them with conversational we're able
to<00:06:26.890> add<00:06:27.040> operations<00:06:27.990> very<00:06:28.990> very<00:06:29.560> easily<00:06:29.890> by

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
to add operations very very easily by

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.360 
to add operations very very easily by
using<00:06:30.340> things<00:06:30.940> we've<00:06:31.060> already<00:06:31.240> programmed<00:06:31.630> in

using things we've already programmed in

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.160 
using things we've already programmed in
this<00:06:33.370> case<00:06:33.640> I<00:06:33.910> want<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.840> take<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:35.620> mill<00:06:35.920> frame

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
this case I want to take that mill frame

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.430 
this case I want to take that mill frame
I'm<00:06:38.170> sorry<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.650> mill<00:06:38.830> circle<00:06:39.720> pocket<00:06:40.720> the

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
large one and I want to add a chamfer to

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.320 
large one and I want to add a chamfer to
it<00:06:44.070> well<00:06:45.070> I<00:06:45.100> can<00:06:45.370> simply<00:06:45.730> highlight<00:06:46.000> that

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
it well I can simply highlight that

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.050 
it well I can simply highlight that
particular<00:06:46.480> block<00:06:47.520> go<00:06:48.520> into<00:06:48.730> my<00:06:48.850> block

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
particular block go into my block

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.230 
particular block go into my block
multiple<00:06:50.050> block<00:06:50.230> functions<00:06:50.800> copy<00:06:51.280> and<00:06:51.670> then

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
multiple block functions copy and then

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.210 
multiple block functions copy and then
paste<00:06:52.270> that<00:06:52.750> block<00:06:53.050> after<00:06:53.320> the<00:06:53.620> wholes<00:06:53.950> block

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
paste that block after the wholes block

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.250 
paste that block after the wholes block
at<00:06:54.370> the<00:06:54.460> end<00:06:54.580> of<00:06:54.640> the<00:06:54.700> program<00:06:55.060> so<00:06:55.900> now<00:06:56.050> I've

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
at the end of the program so now I've

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.410 
at the end of the program so now I've
taken<00:06:56.290> block<00:06:57.070> number<00:06:57.400> three<00:06:57.670> I've

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
taken block number three I've

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.570 
taken block number three I've
highlighted<00:06:58.720> it<00:06:59.140> copied<00:06:59.710> it<00:06:59.830> and<00:06:59.980> pasted<00:07:00.460> it

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
highlighted it copied it and pasted it

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.050 
highlighted it copied it and pasted it
after<00:07:00.880> block<00:07:01.090> five<00:07:01.390> I<00:07:02.340> then<00:07:03.340> can<00:07:03.550> go<00:07:03.700> in<00:07:03.880> and

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
after block five I then can go in and

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.520 
after block five I then can go in and
change<00:07:04.270> the<00:07:04.360> depth<00:07:04.690> to<00:07:05.020> minus<00:07:05.290> thirty

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
change the depth to minus thirty

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.440 
change the depth to minus thirty
thousands<00:07:06.070> change<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:06.910> tool<00:07:07.120> that<00:07:07.330> I'm<00:07:07.420> going

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
thousands change the tool that I'm going

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.510 
thousands change the tool that I'm going
to<00:07:07.720> use<00:07:07.840> and<00:07:08.550> I<00:07:09.550> now<00:07:09.730> have<00:07:10.030> used<00:07:11.400> geometry<00:07:12.400> that

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
to use and I now have used geometry that

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.690 
to use and I now have used geometry that
I've<00:07:12.640> already<00:07:12.790> programmed<00:07:14.220> copied<00:07:15.220> it<00:07:15.340> pasted

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
I've already programmed copied it pasted

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.400 
I've already programmed copied it pasted
it<00:07:15.820> made<00:07:16.060> a<00:07:16.090> few<00:07:16.300> changes<00:07:16.330> and<00:07:16.840> was<00:07:16.960> able<00:07:17.050> to<00:07:17.200> do

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
it made a few changes and was able to do

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.590 
it made a few changes and was able to do
to<00:07:17.830> reproduce<00:07:18.490> that<00:07:18.700> with<00:07:19.180> a<00:07:19.210> different
