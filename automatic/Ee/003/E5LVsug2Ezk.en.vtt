00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.230 
hello minecraft this is Maxwell Jones
for<00:00:05.060> a<00:00:05.090> tutorial<00:00:05.510> on<00:00:05.870> the<00:00:06.200> pulverizer<00:00:07.240> so

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
for a tutorial on the pulverizer so

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.630 
for a tutorial on the pulverizer so
first<00:00:09.230> you<00:00:09.380> need<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:09.530> get<00:00:09.950> up<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.220> virus<00:00:10.400> I

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:10.640 
first you need to get up the virus I

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.400 
first you need to get up the virus I
will<00:00:10.820> not<00:00:10.940> show<00:00:11.120> you<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.300> recipe<00:00:11.840> you<00:00:12.050> will

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
will not show you the recipe you will

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.500 
will not show you the recipe you will
need<00:00:12.470> some<00:00:12.769> kind<00:00:12.800> of<00:00:13.190> power<00:00:13.460> to<00:00:13.700> power<00:00:13.940> it<00:00:14.120> here

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
need some kind of power to power it here

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.450 
need some kind of power to power it here
we<00:00:14.630> use<00:00:14.840> some<00:00:15.110> redstone<00:00:15.320> energy<00:00:15.950> conducts

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
we use some redstone energy conducts

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.989 
we use some redstone energy conducts
from<00:00:17.449> our<00:00:17.659> power<00:00:17.929> source<00:00:18.230> here<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:19.730> power

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:19.999 
from our power source here and we power

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:21.999 
from our power source here and we power
down<00:00:20.089> our<00:00:20.359> pulverizer<00:00:20.989> we<00:00:21.470> see<00:00:21.650> immediately

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
down our pulverizer we see immediately

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.909 
down our pulverizer we see immediately
that<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.310> energy<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.089> coming<00:00:23.659> in<00:00:23.960> it<00:00:24.650> can

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
that the energy is coming in it can

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.630

siren<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.969> main<00:00:59.179> output<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.870> down<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
siren on the main output and down is the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.130 
siren on the main output and down is the
secondary<00:01:00.949> output<00:01:01.359> you<00:01:02.359> can<00:01:02.510> pipe<00:01:02.749> it<00:01:02.929> also

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
secondary output you can pipe it also

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.530 
secondary output you can pipe it also
into<00:01:03.559> pipes<00:01:03.859> like<00:01:04.280> cobblestone<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.060> stone

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
into pipes like cobblestone and stone

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.390 
into pipes like cobblestone and stone
transport<00:01:06.050> pipe<00:01:06.260> like<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.800> and<00:01:09.130> let's<00:01:10.130> say<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
transport pipe like so and let's say the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.700 
transport pipe like so and let's say the
top<00:01:10.550> output<00:01:11.060> will<00:01:11.300> be<00:01:11.450> for<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> main<00:01:12.080> product

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
top output will be for the main product

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.070 
top output will be for the main product
and<00:01:12.970> right<00:01:13.970> output<00:01:14.450> will<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.810> for<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
and right output will be for the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.740 
and right output will be for the
secondary<00:01:15.470> product<00:01:18.340> we<00:01:19.340> can<00:01:19.520> put<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.730> leave

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
secondary product we can put a leave

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.900 
secondary product we can put a leave
so<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:21.290> activate<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:21.950> deactivate<00:01:21.980> it<00:01:22.700> so

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
so we can activate or deactivate it so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.870 
so we can activate or deactivate it so
output<00:01:23.120> one<00:01:23.900> iron<00:01:24.320> ore<00:01:24.440> inside<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.190> see<00:01:25.430> it's

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
output one iron ore inside you see it's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.940 
output one iron ore inside you see it's
polarizing<00:01:26.330> because<00:01:26.930> it's<00:01:27.140> activated<00:01:27.740> at<00:01:27.860> a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
polarizing because it's activated at a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.210 
polarizing because it's activated at a
moment<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.490> let's<00:01:28.670> deactivate<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.780> see

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
moment so let's deactivate it and see

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.280 
moment so let's deactivate it and see
now<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.370> should<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.550> off<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.150> not<00:01:32.510> doing<00:01:33.140> its

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
now it should be off and not doing its

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.670 
now it should be off and not doing its
work<00:01:34.390> there<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.540> couple<00:01:35.870> of<00:01:35.930> ways<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.350> input

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
work there is a couple of ways to input

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.620 
work there is a couple of ways to input
our<00:01:36.800> materials<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.670> pulverizer<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:44.390> now

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
our materials in the pulverizer so now

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.730
