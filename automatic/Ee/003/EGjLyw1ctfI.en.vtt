really all built to house this one major
air<00:01:31.350> vent<00:01:31.590> system<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.009> called<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> big<00:01:32.520> air

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
air vent system it's called the big air

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
air vent system it's called the big air
vent<00:01:32.970> system<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.780> you've<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.500> your

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
vent system so you've got all your

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
vent system so you've got all your
waterproof<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.880> protects<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> outside

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
waterproof and protects on the outside

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
waterproof and protects on the outside
double<00:01:37.920> layered<00:01:38.189> storm<00:01:38.640> flaps<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.210> snaps<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
double layered storm flaps with snaps in

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.100 
double layered storm flaps with snaps in
place<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> tape<00:01:41.100> zipper<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.700> well

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
place you have the tape zipper as well

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
place you have the tape zipper as well
but<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.290> underneath<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> here's<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> big

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
but then underneath that here's the big

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.370 
but then underneath that here's the big
air<00:01:44.790> vent<00:01:45.060> system<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:45.509> talking<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:45.930> it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
air vent system we're talking about it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
air vent system we're talking about it's
essentially<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.820> mesh<00:01:48.090> panels<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.780> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
essentially just two mesh panels one on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.899 
essentially just two mesh panels one on
each<00:01:49.049> side<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.740> zip<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.220> together<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
each side you can zip this together and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
each side you can zip this together and
then<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.840> hot<00:01:52.140> while<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:52.560> writing

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
then if you get hot while you're writing

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
then if you get hot while you're writing
you<00:01:53.280> open<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you open this up and now you have a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
you open this up and now you have a
massive<00:01:54.990> amount<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.290> air<00:01:55.380> flow<00:01:55.409> coming

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
massive amount of air flow coming

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
massive amount of air flow coming
through<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> center<00:01:56.219> these<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:57.299> go

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
through the center these actually go

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
through the center these actually go
back<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.100> snap<00:01:59.369> them<00:01:59.520> shut

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
back into here you can snap them shut

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.670 
back into here you can snap them shut
and<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.299> holds<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:00.750> flaps<00:02:01.079> out<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> way

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and it holds these flaps out of the way

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.039 
and it holds these flaps out of the way
in<00:02:02.579> terms<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.000> storage<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.810> some

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
in terms of storage you do have some

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.929 
in terms of storage you do have some
options<00:02:04.340> particularly<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.490> lower<00:02:05.640> part

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
options particularly on the lower part

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
options particularly on the lower part
of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> one-piece<00:02:07.079> suit<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.740> there's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
of the of the one-piece suit but there's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.589 
of the of the one-piece suit but there's
a<00:02:08.009> small<00:02:08.129> pocket<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.000> side<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
on the waist on each side that's normal

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.830 
on the waist on each side that's normal
right<00:02:40.129> however<00:02:40.400> they<00:02:41.000> also<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> up<00:02:41.629> here

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
right however they also have it up here

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.119 
right however they also have it up here
under<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.079> underarms<00:02:42.500> which<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.769> great

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
under the underarms which is great

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.619 
under the underarms which is great
especially<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:43.700> guy<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:43.819> Alex<00:02:44.269> he's<00:02:44.390> tall

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
especially for a guy like Alex he's tall

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.629 
especially for a guy like Alex he's tall
and<00:02:44.659> thin<00:02:45.019> cinch<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.769> down<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:46.250> really<00:02:46.430> helps

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
and thin cinch this down it really helps

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.399 
and thin cinch this down it really helps
pull<00:02:46.849> in<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> material<00:02:47.420> upper<00:02:48.019> leg<00:02:48.230> we're

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
pull in the material upper leg we're

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.990 
pull in the material upper leg we're
gonna<00:02:48.530> find<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.920> as<00:02:49.010> well<00:02:49.190> which<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.549> awesome

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
gonna find it as well which is awesome

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.369 
gonna find it as well which is awesome
and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.180> down<00:02:50.659> here<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> bottom<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.319> the

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
and then down here at the bottom of the

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.869 
and then down here at the bottom of the
cuff<00:02:51.530> which<00:02:51.709> again<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.069> pretty<00:02:52.310> standard<00:02:52.579> so

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
cuff which again is pretty standard so

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.789 
cuff which again is pretty standard so
adding<00:02:53.239> these<00:02:53.389> two<00:02:53.629> straps<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.139> think<00:02:54.379> is<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> big

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
adding these two straps I think is a big

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.819 
adding these two straps I think is a big
advantage<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.909> leg<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.409> this<00:02:57.560> long

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
advantage on the leg you have this long
