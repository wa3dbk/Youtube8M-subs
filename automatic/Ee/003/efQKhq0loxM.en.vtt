00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.910
 so beautiful that you are there 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.480
 press conference before our 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 basking on friday at the vfr basking 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 You can always say that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.460
 current table guide to all 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.950
 We will be about two and a half thousand fck 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.970
 we accompany fans here on site 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.520
 2100 tickets the entire contingent 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.820
 sold 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.880
 2000 fans included in the East Alb 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 the Swabian Ostalb resident 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.910
 louder fans will be there like that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.060
 that has not been determined 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.720
 that happens tomorrow run of the day 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:01.280
 then we play in the dfb cup in Rostock 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.700
 at the friendly sunday 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 I sold 30 to 300 tickets so far 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 say a little bit to there, we understand 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 So far, there are 18,600 ten permanent maps 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.450
 sold and then afterwards 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 Rostock then home game against 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 1860 Munich so far just over 24,000 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.040
 Tickets come to a guest matze though 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 for one or the other maybe 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.140
 surprisingly because jan simak announced 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.330
 are just too short a short explanation 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 began has indeed in the warm up 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.110
 suffered a calf injury 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 It may not be that serious 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.030
 use against people seriously endangered 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.520
 but there is still one 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.720
 Unpredictability gives us and we put the pressure on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.490
 the player was not increased yet 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.130
 we said we put on maxi 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.940
 Abel is full of joy 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.710
 has declared matze probably 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.930
 your first appearance in one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 on friday and directly with the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.260
 subsequent question that was already one 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.409
 Surprise that the tg speaks like that 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.700
 Have cushioned yes, first of all , nice 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.650
 monday hello everybody 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.930
 yes, of course something with surprise 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.989
 also abroad in the second league then 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.540
 relatively furious and sovereign 420 pieces too 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.670
 win, I guess that shows 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.459
 from a very good appearance and before 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.330
 to call a bit respect the medial 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.130
 it must be clear and they are with 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.370
 a victory in the season we started 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.010
 unfortunately still have a 3 3 cashed but 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 nonetheless, I think on friday 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 will be a good match we will be 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.470
 go there to play on victory 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.600
 three points finally the first three 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.120
 to score points 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.090
 and yes that's just our goal and 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.160
 with this with this expectation and with 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.700
 the great support as I live now 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.010
 with two and a half thousand fans we will 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.300
 address on Friday to leave the game 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.360
 take a quick look back at the game 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.290
 against union this is common with two 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.690
 completely different halves 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.860
 divided the first half 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.230
 Maybe they overslept 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 second for very fulminant too 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.750
 play for the audience with 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.340
 a total of six goals 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.220
 as judged only in retrospect 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.239
 yes, I judge similarly although I do 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.530
 again a little bit different 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.000
 visually I think that the first 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 it 's just such a game 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.709
 was what I think ours too 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.390
 fans a bit of the idea 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.530
 should adjust that all 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.489
 teams I believe here 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.560
 come that first back 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.269
 do not put it like a first 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.070
 league is what we definitely want 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.230
 tone must specify that the teams 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.810
 First, wait and see 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.250
 play counter and that's it then yes 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.950
 will be a completely different game for us 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.910
 when the last years have been and must be there 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.180
 maybe a bit more 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.159
 have patience 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.370
 and we look where the gaps arise 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.260
 and where the awo's approaches are to lift 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.549
 that such a team is so deep 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.450
 defensive team then 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.299
 can leverage 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.739
 and chances to come you have it 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.310
 Of course, the first half not so 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.750
 well done or not more than 0 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.980
 but also made a bit too 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.170
 played slowly but the second 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.750
 at half-time then also more rooms gave where 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.099
 We then really brave 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.969
 you have played forward then you have 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.500
 seen that we are always ahead 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.030
 can create opportunities again and then 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.250
 also three goals 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.590
 you probably have 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.090
 self- esteem of the aalener and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.009
 the related aspects on your part 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 wanted to go against him as wanted 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.110
 do you expect them and what do you know about them 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.780
 about the team, so I think so 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.400
 that's a very big sign 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.220
 Euphoria in the team is plan 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.039
 with this climb with which no one 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.599
 has necessarily expected and with the 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.130
 then you just enjoy it too 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.780
 Every season, every player has a season 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.099
 burn if you have the name now 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.030
 kaiserslautern hear again and the 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.590
 first home game 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.659
 I think there must be with all models 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.710
 Do not talk big then you would have to know 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:58.940
 he informed 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.400
 what is at stake and yes we have to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.840
 set us up and we have to do the same 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.030
 burn medial because it too ours 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.139
 first appearance is abroad and because 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.699
 We do not play the first game either 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.630
 I think so already 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.830
 it will be a good match where two 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.849
 enthusiastic teams on each other 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.279
 meet where we are then 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.770
 hopefully as winner of the place went 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:23.129
 have you asked once locked 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.709
 three file with the chef trainer franco 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.110
 foda of over 200,000 fans to begin with 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:31.229
 our outward debut total time 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.889
 call a spade that's just the 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.050
 truth current trend what to expect 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.830
 you for a game in all and how 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.559
 do you expect the opponent 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.110
 it is always great because otherwise 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.289
 many fans to the away game 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.789
 support 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.689
 and already here at the home game against 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.249
 Union Berlin unlikely great the 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.099
 especially support the team 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.839
 the team always has the 0 2 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.689
 have driven forward but also on 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.309
 the team believed therefore came too 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.349
 We are looking forward to the turnaround 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.080
 to be in the away game in Ahlen 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:11.129
 again actively support our 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.860
 Fans only away game will be safe 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.959
 we can play something different 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.089
 maybe a bit more compact 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.519
 play defensive forward plays too 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:22.499
 home on the away 4 1 won 

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:25.259
 of course try with this euphoria 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:27.360
 to play forward and would be safe 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.009
 hopefully much more space for us then 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.800
 and give space as the first half 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.869
 against union berlin is already foreseeable 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:40.199
 which players we have friday on 

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:41.939
 which can certainly not grow with 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:47.729
 not to debate also offer as before 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:49.469
 from simone is questionable otherwise you will 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:53.819
 see and it goes with this born 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:56.839
 finger and ready to ask now 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.839
 your side the textbook coaches
