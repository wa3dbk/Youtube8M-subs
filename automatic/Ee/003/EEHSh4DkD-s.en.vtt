00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.619
 min 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.759
 but we respect the clear foundations we are going to pass when we make the end 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.390
 of goal the first thing 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.779
 he wants to be clear about what is going to have three lines 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.679
 and I hope it's the sand these eleven people line our tanks 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.630
 the objective line 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.990
 and the line of the club face 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.580
 you have to perform 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 the sena through the line we are 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.050
 been to the stage 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 do not perform 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 the sena through the lines ico positive because it will enter very directly 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.810
 towards the inside of the bar causing an error 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.570
 It's very important 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 when climbing the golf club that breaks the wrists 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.760
 depending on the wrist breakage if you are going to have more or less success 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630
 if you have a banking outlet it is complicated 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.259
 with a very short flag will break very little his shoulders will turn little 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.610
 if you have a flag farther from the fair are much more dogs 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.110
 dolls i their shoulders to spin a lot more 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 a very important point how many times sustain these movements 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.520
 this series of farnals consequence sound that does is enter the edge of the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 clubhead 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.850
 and what Caesar nava the stoppage inside the fine sand ball does not come out is a mistake 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.020
 very serious like what you have to do is accelerate 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.030
 the clubhead through the sand this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 so that the ball so far up 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.200
 important point 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 if you 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 have this rise 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.550
 in his one final move 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.780
 it has to be the same proportion 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.190
 if you raise less 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 its proportion will be this 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.949
 well once chopped 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.249
 these four points we are going to realize a dream 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.480
 we place 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 we enjoy goal that's what we're doing 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.309
 fantastic 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.319
 to send the aldrin ball to the omc from ascended dotcom 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.329
 practice it 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.879
 mmmmm
