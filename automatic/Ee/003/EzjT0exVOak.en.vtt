00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
say about the microphone is that it does

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.420 
say about the microphone is that it does
not<00:00:55.060> play<00:00:55.510> what'd<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.080> say<00:00:56.350> back<00:00:56.800> into<00:00:57.280> your

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
not play what'd you say back into your

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.700 
not play what'd you say back into your
headset<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.060> since<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.750> headset<00:00:59.080> has<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.320> lot

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
headset and since the headset has a lot

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.560 
headset and since the headset has a lot
of<00:00:59.740> noise<00:01:00.040> cancelling<00:01:00.520> functions<00:01:01.000> in<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:01.330> it

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
of noise cancelling functions in it it

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.630 
of noise cancelling functions in it it
can<00:01:02.050> make<00:01:02.290> you<00:01:02.500> maybe<00:01:02.770> yell<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.130> bit<00:01:03.370> louder

can make you maybe yell a bit louder
into<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.119> microphone<00:01:04.509> but<00:01:04.839> that<00:01:05.049> can<00:01:05.259> be

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
into the microphone but that can be

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.230 
into the microphone but that can be
adjusted<00:01:05.560> for<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:06.880> one<00:01:07.060> extra

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
adjusted for it is just one extra

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.730 
adjusted for it is just one extra
feature<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.900> would<00:01:08.170> have<00:01:08.259> liked<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.530> see

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
which can lead to sometimes the headsets

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.110 
which can lead to sometimes the headsets
sliding<00:01:20.560> around<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.070> bit<00:01:21.220> but<00:01:21.400> don't<00:01:22.000> worry
