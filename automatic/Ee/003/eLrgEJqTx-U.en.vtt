all right mind if an athlete

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
all right mind if an athlete
round<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> competition<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:37.920> over

round two so the competition is now over

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.410 
round two so the competition is now over
and<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.430> been<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> couple<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.000> days<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.329> I've

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and it's been a couple of days and I've

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.900 
and it's been a couple of days and I've
been<00:00:39.510> able<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> kind<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> gather<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.440> thoughts

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
been able to kind of gather my thoughts

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
been able to kind of gather my thoughts
and<00:00:41.910> kind<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.570> let<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.350> mind

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and kind of let my mind

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
and kind of let my mind
settle<00:00:44.100> down<00:00:44.129> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> competition<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.230> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
settle down from the competition so we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.619 
settle down from the competition so we
ended<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.219> coming<00:00:47.520> second<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> prelim<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
ended up coming second in the prelim and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.750 
ended up coming second in the prelim and
fifth<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> semi<00:00:49.620> final<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> means<00:00:50.550> we

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
fifth in the semi final so that means we

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
fifth in the semi final so that means we
didn't<00:00:51.030> qualify<00:00:51.329> our<00:00:51.870> country<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.559> the

out<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> winning<00:00:56.940> Silver's<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.960> right

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
future and I've kind of at first it's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.570 
future and I've kind of at first it's
like<00:01:04.500> negative<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.159> come<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
like negative when you come out on a

competition you don't get the result you
want<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.680> oh<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> could<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.220> done<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
want it's like oh I could have done this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
want it's like oh I could have done this
this<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.880> better<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> now<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> have

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
this and this better but now that have

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.780 
this and this better but now that have
had<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> few<00:01:10.830> days<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
had a few days to think about it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
had a few days to think about it
my<00:01:12.000> mind<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> switched<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> negatives

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
my mind is switched from the negatives

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160 
my mind is switched from the negatives
to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> positives<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.360> since<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.630> sort<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to the positives and since it's sort of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770 
to the positives and since it's sort of
positives<00:01:16.680> I've<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.299> learned<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.540> lot

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
positives I've actually learned a lot

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
positives I've actually learned a lot
from<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.500> experience<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.430> guess<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> biggest

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
from this experience I guess the biggest

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
from this experience I guess the biggest
thing<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> learned<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> David<00:01:23.130> as

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
thing I learned is that me and David as

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
thing I learned is that me and David as
a<00:01:23.280> team<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> mix<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> the

fifth best team in the world that's not
bad<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.860> mean<00:01:41.009> yeah<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.729> have

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
bad at all I mean yeah we would have

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.950 
bad at all I mean yeah we would have
liked<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> got<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> metal<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.689> gotten<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
liked to got in the metal and gotten the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
liked to got in the metal and gotten the
Olympic<00:01:43.259> spot<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.220> there's<00:01:44.490> four<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:45.000> spots

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
Olympic spot but there's four more spots

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.289 
Olympic spot but there's four more spots
that<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.140> February<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.860> Brazil

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
that we can get in February in Brazil

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
that we can get in February in Brazil
and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.899> continuing<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and I think if we just continuing to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.429 
and I think if we just continuing to
train<00:01:50.220> hard<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.119> fix<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> need<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> fix

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
train hard and fix what we need to fix

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.990 
train hard and fix what we need to fix
and<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> same<00:01:53.369> mindset<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.820> we

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and going with the same mindset as we

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
and going with the same mindset as we
did<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.750> qualify<00:01:54.990> America<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
did here not to qualify America but just

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
did here not to qualify America but just
to<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> best<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.390> each<00:01:57.420> dive

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to do the best that we can on each dive

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
to do the best that we can on each dive
I<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.399> results<00:01:59.820> will<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.329> turn

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I think that the results will in turn

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.030 
I think that the results will in turn
come<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.350> need<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> keep<00:02:01.649> training<00:02:01.860> hard

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
come we just need to keep training hard

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
come we just need to keep training hard
and<00:02:02.340> keep<00:02:02.610> having<00:02:02.759> fun<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.960> easy

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and keep having fun with it so it's easy
