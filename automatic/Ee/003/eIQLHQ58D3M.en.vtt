remember could I do pretty good and the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
remember could I do pretty good and the
beginning<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> could<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
beginning you could see that I'm kind of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
beginning you could see that I'm kind of
hanging<00:01:04.290> back<00:01:04.640> try<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.820> some

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> ground<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> just

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
on the ground and you see there I just

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.340 
on the ground and you see there I just
miss<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> triple<00:01:40.590> fee<00:01:40.740> i<00:01:40.770> only<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.579> them

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
miss a triple fee i only got one of them

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.760 
miss a triple fee i only got one of them
but<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.369> big<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> deal

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
but it's not going to be that big a deal

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.800 
but it's not going to be that big a deal
and<00:01:46.189> some<00:01:46.549> people<00:01:46.609> ask<00:01:46.969> you<00:01:47.240> know<00:01:47.270> why<00:01:47.600> do<00:01:47.659> you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and some people ask you know why do you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.529 
and some people ask you know why do you
use<00:01:47.899> counter<00:01:48.079> spy<00:01:48.380> plane<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:50.149> think<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
use counter spy plane and I think that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.569 
use counter spy plane and I think that
is<00:01:50.659> one<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> most<00:01:51.259> underrated<00:01:52.009> kill

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
is one of the most underrated kill

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.569 
is one of the most underrated kill
streaks<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.270> game<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:54.070> mean<00:01:55.070> if<00:01:55.189> you<00:01:55.310> rely

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
streaks in the game I mean if you rely

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.480 
streaks in the game I mean if you rely
heavily<00:01:55.789> on<00:01:56.030> your<00:01:56.240> radar<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.460> have<00:01:58.460> a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
heavily on your radar and you have a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.279 
heavily on your radar and you have a
CounterSpy<00:01:58.969> playing<00:01:59.299> up<00:01:59.450> against<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.020> it

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
CounterSpy playing up against you it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.120 
CounterSpy playing up against you it
completely<00:02:01.219> messes<00:02:01.729> up<00:02:01.850> your<00:02:01.880> game<00:02:02.210> play<00:02:03.130> if

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
completely messes up your game play if

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.830 
completely messes up your game play if
you<00:02:04.369> don't<00:02:04.549> rely<00:02:04.759> on<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.969> radar<00:02:05.149> very<00:02:05.659> much

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
you don't rely on the radar very much

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.029 
you don't rely on the radar very much
then<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:06.319> not<00:02:06.439> really<00:02:06.649> going<00:02:06.709> to<00:02:06.829> have<00:02:06.920> any

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
then it's not really going to have any

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.820 
then it's not really going to have any
effect<00:02:07.069> on<00:02:07.459> you<00:02:07.700> but<00:02:08.629> if<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.840> if<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.679> other

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
effect on you but if you if the other

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.059 
effect on you but if you if the other

counter spy plane I mean Deb counters by

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.420 
counter spy plane I mean Deb counters by
believe<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> pretty<00:02:20.540> much<00:02:21.160> takes<00:02:22.160> care<00:02:22.310> of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
believe it pretty much takes care of

that sr-71 while that counters by planes

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.860 
that sr-71 while that counters by planes
up<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:25.010> mean<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.910> as<00:02:26.060> our<00:02:26.180> 71<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.660> worthless

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
up I mean that as our 71 is worthless
