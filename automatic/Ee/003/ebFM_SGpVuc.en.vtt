I had tried harder because this came is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.439 
I had tried harder because this came is
really<00:00:55.500> fun<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.010> didn't<00:00:56.670> actually<00:00:56.789> count<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> as

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
really fun I didn't actually count it as

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.830 
really fun I didn't actually count it as
one<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> top<00:00:58.020> ten<00:00:58.350> games<00:00:58.680> from<00:00:59.370> 2010<00:01:00.210> when

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
one of the top ten games from 2010 when

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
one of the top ten games from 2010 when
I<00:01:00.870> did<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> list<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> reprint

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I did that list because it's a reprint

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.729 
I did that list because it's a reprint
but<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> would<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.019> made<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> list

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
but it would have made the list

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
but it would have made the list
otherwise<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.600> fun<00:01:06.900> it's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
otherwise it was just that much fun it's

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.700 
otherwise it was just that much fun it's
so<00:01:07.350> simple<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.400> easy<00:01:08.570> hunting<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.140> mean

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
expansion you can throw in squid just

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:41.900 
expansion you can throw in squid just
lots<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> lots<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> fun<00:01:22.770> let's<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.970> it

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.280 

so<00:01:42.910> here's<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.240> board<00:01:43.450> at<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.630> beginning<00:01:43.780> of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
so here's the board at the beginning of

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.200 
so here's the board at the beginning of
the<00:01:44.800> game<00:01:44.980> it's<00:01:45.220> set<00:01:45.400> randomly<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.000> pull

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
the game it's set randomly you pull

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.700 
the game it's set randomly you pull
these<00:01:46.330> tiles<00:01:46.720> out<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.960> bag<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.380> set<00:01:47.530> them<00:01:47.650> up

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
these tiles out of a bag and set them up

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.920 
these tiles out of a bag and set them up
in<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:47.950> shape<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:49.420> take<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.630> look<00:01:49.810> at

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
in this shape and just take a look at

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.840 
in this shape and just take a look at
these<00:01:50.020> tiles<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.680> have<00:01:50.830> Mountain<00:01:51.280> Beach<00:01:51.490> and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
these tiles we have Mountain Beach and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.730 
these tiles we have Mountain Beach and
forest<00:01:52.300> but<00:01:52.900> if<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.200> notice<00:01:53.530> here<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
forest but if you notice here the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.920 
forest but if you notice here the
thickness<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.670> different<00:01:55.480> for<00:01:55.630> each<00:01:55.660> of<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
thickness is different for each of the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.540 
thickness is different for each of the
tiles<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.380> mountains<00:01:56.740> are<00:01:56.860> really<00:01:57.130> thick

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
tiles the mountains are really thick

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
tiles the mountains are really thick
tiles<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.980> helps<00:02:00.250> differentiate<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
tiles and that helps differentiate the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.600 
tiles and that helps differentiate the
tiles<00:02:02.050> as<00:02:02.170> they're<00:02:02.290> on<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.530> board<00:02:02.770> because

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
tiles as they're on the board because

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.190 
tiles as they're on the board because
the<00:02:03.790> mountain<00:02:04.060> tiles<00:02:04.330> are<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.510> last<00:02:04.750> ones<00:02:05.050> a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
the mountain tiles are the last ones a

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.480 
the mountain tiles are the last ones a
sink<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.680> beach<00:02:05.860> ones<00:02:06.100> are<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.280> first

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
sink and the beach ones are the first

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.210 
sink and the beach ones are the first
one<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.820> go<00:02:07.110> players<00:02:08.110> will<00:02:08.410> start<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.770> game<00:02:08.800> by

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
one to go players will start the game by

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790

know what that is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.170 
know what that is
players<00:02:20.770> also<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.190> get<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.460> place<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> boat

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
players also you get to place a boat

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.080 
players also you get to place a boat
somewhere<00:02:22.540> along<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.410> map<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
somewhere along the map and on the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.490 
somewhere along the map and on the
players<00:02:25.300> turn<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> first<00:02:25.870> thing<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.350> do

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
players turn the first thing they can do

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.430 
players turn the first thing they can do
is<00:02:26.530> play<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> tile<00:02:27.490> now<00:02:28.210> players<00:02:29.020> won't<00:02:29.230> be<00:02:29.350> able

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
is play a tile now players won't be able

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.500 
is play a tile now players won't be able
to<00:02:29.500> play<00:02:29.820> every<00:02:30.820> tile<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.240> won't<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.450> able

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
to play every tile and you won't be able

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000 
to play every tile and you won't be able
to<00:02:31.630> do<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.780> at<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.990> beginning<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
to do this at the beginning but you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.620 
to do this at the beginning but you
might<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> tile<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.270> can<00:02:34.420> play

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
might have a tile that you can play

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.570 
might have a tile that you can play
later<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.380> in<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.710> game<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.130> play<00:02:36.160> that

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
later on in the game and you play that

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640 
later on in the game and you play that
tile<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.210> in<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.080> beginning<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.530> game

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
tile but in the beginning of the game

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.290 
tile but in the beginning of the game
you<00:02:38.830> won't<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.490> what<00:02:39.880> you'll<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.150> is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
you won't have that so what you'll do is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.930 
you won't have that so what you'll do is
what<00:02:41.080> most<00:02:41.320> terms<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:41.800> be<00:02:41.920> doing<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.340> where

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
what most terms will be doing is where

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.400 
what most terms will be doing is where
you<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.120> move<00:02:43.240> people<00:02:43.540> up<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.690> three<00:02:43.900> spaces

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you can move people up to three spaces

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.260 
you can move people up to three spaces
so<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> could<00:02:44.740> say<00:02:44.860> okay<00:02:45.100> one<00:02:45.720> two<00:02:46.720> three<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:48.430> if

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
so I could say okay one two three or if

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.530 
so I could say okay one two three or if
I<00:02:49.360> had<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.930> guy<00:02:50.170> here<00:02:50.530> next<00:02:51.400> turn<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.820> could

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
I had this guy here next turn I could

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.000 
I had this guy here next turn I could
say<00:02:52.690> hey<00:02:53.070> one<00:02:54.209> two<00:02:55.209> three<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.590> whoever<00:02:56.950> has

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
say hey one two three now whoever has

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.710 
say hey one two three now whoever has
most<00:02:57.520> people<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.940> boat<00:02:58.090> controls<00:02:58.570> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
most people in the boat controls the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.750 
most people in the boat controls the
boat<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.530> likely<00:02:59.860> green's<00:03:00.310> going<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.580> throw

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
boat so likely green's going to throw

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.550 
boat so likely green's going to throw
Diana's<00:03:01.209> boat<00:03:01.390> because<00:03:01.690> he<00:03:01.870> knows<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.140> I'm

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
Diana's boat because he knows that I'm

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.900 
Diana's boat because he knows that I'm
going<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.770> get<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:02.950> boat<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.310> safety<00:03:03.520> if<00:03:03.790> I'm

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
going to get that boat to safety if I'm

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.960 
going to get that boat to safety if I'm
yellow<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:06.010> worthwhile<00:03:06.400> for<00:03:06.760> him<00:03:06.880> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
yellow and that's worthwhile for him to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.750 
yellow and that's worthwhile for him to
get<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.209> boat<00:03:07.540> with<00:03:08.310> after<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.580> your

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
get on that boat with after you do your

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.610 
get on that boat with after you do your
three<00:03:09.940> movements<00:03:10.270> then<00:03:11.050> you're<00:03:11.470> going<00:03:11.560> to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
three movements then you're going to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.590 
three movements then you're going to
remove<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.010> land<00:03:12.220> tile<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.480> pick<00:03:13.570> a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
remove a land tile you have to pick a

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.420 
remove a land tile you have to pick a
lands<00:03:13.840> how<00:03:13.989> that's<00:03:14.230> next<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.800> an<00:03:14.860> ocean<00:03:15.160> spot

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
lands how that's next to an ocean spot

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.430 
lands how that's next to an ocean spot
somewhere<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.780> has<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.050> be<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.290> lowest

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
somewhere and it has to be the lowest

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.440 
somewhere and it has to be the lowest
possible<00:03:17.800> one<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.400> point<00:03:18.700> time<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.209> I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
possible one at that point time so I

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.290 
possible one at that point time so I
could<00:03:19.989> remove<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.440> one<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:21.640> now<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.120> guy's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
could remove this one and now that guy's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.699 
could remove this one and now that guy's
swimming<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.810> water<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.230> then<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> do

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
swimming in the water and then I do

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.670 
swimming in the water and then I do
whatever<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.820> says<00:03:25.150> unless<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.019> says<00:03:26.170> shows

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
whatever this says unless it says shows

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.190 
whatever this says unless it says shows
a<00:03:26.709> hand<00:03:27.070> token<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.610> which<00:03:28.239> case<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.840> keep<00:03:29.050> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
a hand token in which case I can keep it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.800 
a hand token in which case I can keep it
in<00:03:29.350> my<00:03:29.620> hand<00:03:30.060> now<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.239> yellow<00:03:31.360> guy's<00:03:31.630> not

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
in my hand now this yellow guy's not

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.110 
in my hand now this yellow guy's not
dead<00:03:31.870> he's<00:03:32.470> simply<00:03:32.800> swimming<00:03:33.519> into<00:03:33.640> water<00:03:33.880> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
dead he's simply swimming into water and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.940 
dead he's simply swimming into water and
on<00:03:34.209> future<00:03:34.450> turns<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:35.080> move<00:03:35.170> him<00:03:35.380> one<00:03:35.620> space

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
on future turns I can move him one space

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.740 
on future turns I can move him one space
maximum<00:03:36.640> per<00:03:37.180> turn

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
maximum per turn

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.330 
maximum per turn
so<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:38.320> be<00:03:38.470> careful<00:03:38.769> for<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.070> but<00:03:39.220> there

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
so it's be careful for that but there

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.400 
so it's be careful for that but there
are<00:03:39.459> predators<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:40.180> these<00:03:40.269> seas<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:41.260> see

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
are predators in these seas you can see

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
are predators in these seas you can see
here<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.769> water<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.130> middle<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
here in the water in the middle of the

person I mean he eats one at a time

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.290 
person I mean he eats one at a time
because<00:04:21.430> he's<00:04:21.549> going<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.700> eat<00:04:21.820> them<00:04:21.940> all<00:04:22.060> the

sea serpent destroys all boats and all

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.420 
sea serpent destroys all boats and all
people<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.260> he's<00:04:26.440> worse<00:04:26.710> than<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.010> Sharks<00:04:27.220> in

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
people so he's worse than the Sharks in

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 
people so he's worse than the Sharks in
the<00:04:27.490> whales<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.880> problem<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.930> Sharks<00:04:29.260> can

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the whales the problem is the Sharks can

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.020 
the whales the problem is the Sharks can
move<00:04:29.560> much<00:04:29.770> faster<00:04:30.010> sharks<00:04:30.550> can<00:04:30.730> move<00:04:30.850> one<00:04:30.970> or

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
move much faster sharks can move one or

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.270 
move much faster sharks can move one or
two<00:04:31.150> spaces<00:04:31.570> whales<00:04:32.410> can<00:04:32.710> move<00:04:32.830> up<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:32.950> three

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
two spaces whales can move up to three

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.010 
two spaces whales can move up to three
spaces<00:04:33.610> while<00:04:33.910> sea<00:04:34.180> serpents<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.720> only<00:04:34.840> move

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
spaces while sea serpents can only move

bottom<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.800> player<00:05:00.100> some<00:05:00.669> are<00:05:00.790> worth<00:05:00.940> one

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
bottom of that player some are worth one

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.090 
bottom of that player some are worth one
some<00:05:01.960> are<00:05:02.200> worth<00:05:02.410> three<00:05:02.979> 2<00:05:03.340> 3<00:05:03.669> 4<00:05:03.880> 5<00:05:04.060> etc<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.979> it's

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
some are worth three 2 3 4 5 etc so it's

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.230 
some are worth three 2 3 4 5 etc so it's
not<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.310> number<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.669> people<00:05:06.970> but<00:05:07.120> the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
not the number of people but the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.640 
not the number of people but the
valuable<00:05:07.660> people<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:08.020> guess<00:05:08.169> there's<00:05:08.380> class

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
valuable people I guess there's class

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.860 
valuable people I guess there's class
warfare<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:10.000> that's<00:05:10.210> basically<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.690> goal<00:05:10.810> of

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
warfare and that's basically the goal of

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.600 
warfare and that's basically the goal of
the<00:05:10.930> game<00:05:11.050> as<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.380> game<00:05:11.530> progresses<00:05:11.890> more<00:05:12.220> and

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
the game as the game progresses more and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.840 
the game as the game progresses more and
more<00:05:12.729> tiles<00:05:13.210> will<00:05:13.390> go<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:14.340> there<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.520> tile

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
more tiles will go and there is a tile

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.880 
more tiles will go and there is a tile
that<00:05:15.880> says<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.810> will<00:05:17.080> end<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.650> game

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
that says that will end the game
