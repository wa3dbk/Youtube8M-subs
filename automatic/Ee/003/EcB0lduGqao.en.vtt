00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 project sponsor sapphire 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.049
 sapphire our best recommendations to everyone 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.760
 hi i am arina and this is a techno kitchen we 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 continue to review grocery 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 ruler templarius from aerocool 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.910
 we just looked at the arma ii mouse 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 turn came to gladiator two mouse 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 belong to the templar of the series but precisely 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.520
 the gladiator is professional 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
 gaming decision sensor is no longer 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.279
 optical and laser maximum 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 the resolution is not 2600 a4 1600 dipia but 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.490
 the most important thing is software 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.949
 providing with more fine tuning 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.760
 parameters all the same box book with 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.390
 Beaded instructions and a CD with 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.460
 drivers 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 managed to throw out private correctly 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 you can download firewood from page 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.899
 product 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.329
 about the program later while we consider the mouse 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.430
 after the army she seems more pot-bellied and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 true but this time taller 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.940
 which worsens comfort a little 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 interaction with hand speaking easier 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.590
 unsuccessful arm shape is uncomfortable again on 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.120
 meets white plastic black soft-touch 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.250
 cover but with side edges 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 rubber with characteristic ribs when 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.969
 classic grip ribs do not give 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.010
 slide off the mouse but grab your fingers 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.080
 there is a slipping groove like 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 There is no case with rubber and the rubber is made 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 smooth and the mouse slips out in general 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.799
 aggressive grip eliminated completely 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 we would prefer that the gladiator forms and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.890
 materials copied armu truly 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.470
 comfortable wheel this time thin and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 we even seemed flimsy clicking on 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 scroll tight but moderately and in games 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 surely there will be a button 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 dipia and this time highlighting a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 also already 4 they are two extra 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 buttons that you can configure a click 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 the main buttons seemed different to us 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.520
 side buttons raspberries and made almost 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 not monolithic that we write in the negative 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.869
 Teflon legs this time not such 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.409
 wide and the mouse moves less briskly than 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.930
 excel 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.579
 but what pleased this soft intuitively 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.710
 clear interface and ability 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 settings of everything that moves on each 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.759
 button can hang any function 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.159
 for example starting play when watching 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 film closing the window or selecting everything 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.299
 text but also there is the possibility 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.040
 macro record function exists 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.630
 saving the profile for which the mouse 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.369
 built-in memory is the second tab 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 allows you to choose different careers 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.660
 mice to switch to metal later 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.220
 between preselected options when 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.130
 this can be distinguished sensitivity 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.170
 substitute now 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.280
 buttons and the third tab will allow 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.290
 change logo color 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.090
 by default it was blue red 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.890
 the templar of the series suits best 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.470
 You can also change the brightness 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.970
 blink intensity beauty cable 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 everything is also wicker useless 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.050
 gold-plated contacts 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 beautiful software and mouse in the trash 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 why do bad to look at the ergonomics 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 too high 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.850
 but amateur before using is better 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.770
 do not give yourself too 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.690
 We recommend, what if they like a friend 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 and it will not be convenient to use not 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 forget too tight main buttons and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.960
 too small side marriages are asked 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.440
 thousand rubles and with you was irina 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.440
 I'll see you
