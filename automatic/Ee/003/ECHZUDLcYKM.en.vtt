00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.720
 we continue in the municipality of palmira el 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 corregimiento of the pole of san isidro in 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.139
 road 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 I get off the year to Candelaria 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.279
 florid accompanying carmen and certainly 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.079
 Isabel, who was already with us 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 the previous program that is the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.970
 coordinator of this project carmen 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.650
 thank you for receiving us you are part 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.290
 from a group of before 8 hours 6 families 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.580
 that are in the cornish project 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 you knew something before 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.300
 cornish no idea how to train 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.829
 with it he kills him he kills them he thought 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 difficult is not easy easy because since a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 the women who sometimes say no to me 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.530
 I would like to do some activity that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 generate a conversation you consider that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 This is a good alternative if you do not put 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.730
 many problems the elections not the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 handling with all this heap 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 basically they are used for eggs 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 or for the meat the eggs the eggs or 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.460
 we already have all the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 we have the market the market are already 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.090
 almost sold how much you are going delivery 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.520
 daily 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.460
 Between Friday and Thursday we deliver 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.770
 more or less 450 words 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.990
 daily about a thousand eggs two thousand 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.990
 eggs and for little meat 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.560
 how meat replaces it 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.850
 so you do not have the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.299
 possibility of reproduction of the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.829
 cornice here is the recommendation for 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.350
 those who are listening to us from those 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.880
 mothers family boxes that tell them 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 man I would like that project what 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 because he 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:09.600
 the quail they take time but 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:09.600
 there are also 2,500 the largest 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.050
 they keep laying eggs with what they 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.459
 produces the sale the six eggs 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.459
 families now survive 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.019
 white and rebellious when you have to do 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.870
 other things besides them with the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.099
 food a daily bulge and we paid 612 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:38.480
 thousand pesos a week, so it helps but 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.129
 I could not live only the corts not 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 unless they have a very large shed no 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.940
 the only way to fill the entire plug 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.970
 from ccoo the same thing because it's comical easy 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.549
 the same and could escape five thousand 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.890
 with five thousand if they could hold the 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.870
 six families of course that's a project 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.380
 productive that women can handle 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.599
 easily from Carmen without experience or 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.360
 kill the trained and there is a possibility 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.670
 to do it kills novelty the 150 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.379
 animals and three rounds of food with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.290
 we 're going in storm motion and two classrooms 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.010
 a cage but it's what kills family 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.739
 departure 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.739
 Well hopefully that's the only thing yes 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 perseverance the man in which 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.250
 you only need it if it's like the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.880
 success are more applied more judiciously in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.880
 the exercise 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.079

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.189
