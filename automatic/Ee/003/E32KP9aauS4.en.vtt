00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
what that sprite from tales is probably

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.429 
what that sprite from tales is probably
from<00:03:00.599> sonic<00:03:00.959> 3<00:03:01.200> &amp;<00:03:01.379> knuckles<00:03:01.500> probably<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.189> to

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
from sonic 3 &amp; knuckles probably is to

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.490 
from sonic 3 &amp; knuckles probably is to
improved<00:03:04.439> graphics<00:03:04.620> doesn't<00:03:05.099> look<00:03:05.220> bit<00:03:05.430> good

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
improved graphics doesn't look bit good

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.949 
improved graphics doesn't look bit good
almost<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.950> other<00:03:08.359> blue<00:03:09.359> ocean<00:03:09.810> zone

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
almost like the other blue ocean zone

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.379 
almost like the other blue ocean zone
let's<00:03:10.200> do<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:14.670> zone<00:03:14.879> sonic<00:03:15.269> is

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
let's do it and this zone sonic is

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.940 
let's do it and this zone sonic is
probably<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.780> least<00:03:15.930> useful<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.620> he

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
probably the least useful because he

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
probably the least useful because he
can't<00:03:17.549> fly<00:03:17.819> obviously<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.430> think<00:03:20.430> he's<00:03:20.760> like

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
can't fly obviously I think he's like

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.210 
can't fly obviously I think he's like
probably<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.480> fastest<00:03:22.109> he<00:03:22.620> should<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.099> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
probably the fastest he should be the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.940 
probably the fastest he should be the
fastest<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:24.379> there's<00:03:25.379> another<00:03:25.560> thing<00:03:25.680> that

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
fastest and there's another thing that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.129 
fastest and there's another thing that
he<00:03:26.069> can<00:03:26.099> do<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.579> other<00:03:26.700> two<00:03:27.510> characters

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
he can do that the other two characters

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.699 
he can do that the other two characters
can't<00:03:29.209> he<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.419> go<00:03:30.540> through<00:03:30.720> some<00:03:30.900> doors<00:03:31.139> but

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
can't he can go through some doors but

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.289 
can't he can go through some doors but
some<00:03:31.980> people<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.700> other<00:03:32.819> two<00:03:33.000> people

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
some people that the other two people

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:42.129 
some people that the other two people
can't<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:38.459> works<00:03:38.760> he's<00:03:39.329> found<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.659> place<00:03:39.900> so

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
can't it works he's found the place so

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:50.000 
can't it works he's found the place so
we<00:03:43.139> want<00:03:44.099> tails<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.489> fast

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.429 

I<00:03:51.620> can't<00:03:52.620> fly<00:03:53.459> off<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.939> job<00:03:54.930> that's<00:03:55.200> awesome

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
probably would have been better data

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.880 
probably would have been better data
with<00:05:10.730> knuckles<00:05:11.090> or<00:05:11.210> something<00:05:11.510> else<00:05:11.890> because

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
with knuckles or something else because

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.550 
with knuckles or something else because
knuckles<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.550> flag<00:05:16.930> well<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.020> tells<00:05:18.140> can<00:05:18.350> fly

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
knuckles can flag well it tells can fly

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.410 
this is kind of based like off a sonic
CD<00:07:31.190> because<00:07:32.190> they<00:07:32.430> have<00:07:32.550> the<00:07:32.670> same<00:07:32.880> sonic<00:07:33.120> CD
