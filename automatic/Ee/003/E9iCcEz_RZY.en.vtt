skins and seeds correct so what happens
next<00:00:29.190> it<00:00:29.430> goes<00:00:29.610> into<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.940> press<00:00:33.410> as<00:00:34.410> soon<00:00:34.710> as

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
next it goes into the press as soon as

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.970 
next it goes into the press as soon as
the<00:00:35.100> mast<00:00:35.400> hits<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.480> press<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.350> juice<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the mast hits the press the juice just

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
the mast hits the press the juice just
through<00:00:38.160> gravity<00:00:38.580> starts<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> drain<00:00:39.480> away

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
through gravity starts to drain away

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.340 
through gravity starts to drain away
right

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
right

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.620 
right
so<00:00:40.650> that<00:00:41.010> juice<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> called<00:00:41.670> free<00:00:42.150> run<00:00:42.360> juice

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and that gets about 75% of the juice

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.470 
and that gets about 75% of the juice
right<00:00:45.750> away<00:00:46.170> from<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.980> grapes<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:48.150> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
right away from the grapes so all the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
right away from the grapes so all the
must<00:00:48.750> goes<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.530> seeds<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.730> skin<00:00:51.150> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
must goes up there seeds and skin and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.689 
must goes up there seeds and skin and
the<00:00:51.629> juice<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.220> because<00:00:53.220> of<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> the

free<00:04:30.350> run<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.710> what<00:04:31.130> we're<00:04:31.250> left<00:04:31.370> with<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.880> the

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
free run and what we're left with is the

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.580 
free run and what we're left with is the
pressings<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.870> reason<00:04:33.110> why<00:04:33.200> we<00:04:33.350> call<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
pressings and the reason why we call the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.200 
pressings and the reason why we call the
pressings<00:04:33.980> is<00:04:34.190> obviously<00:04:34.760> we've<00:04:35.000> actually

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
pressings is obviously we've actually

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.630 
pressings is obviously we've actually
press<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.200> skins<00:04:36.500> together<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:37.340> get<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
press the skins together to get the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.480 
press the skins together to get the
remaining<00:04:37.970> juice<00:04:38.270> out<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.110> take<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.500> huge

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
remaining juice out so you take a huge

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.050 
remaining juice out so you take a huge
vat<00:04:40.970> or<00:04:41.240> container<00:04:42.140> full<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.440> grapes<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:43.640> put

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
vat or container full of grapes you put

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.150 
vat or container full of grapes you put
them<00:04:44.240> into<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.510> container<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.560> get<00:04:45.890> rid<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.070> all

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
them into a container you get rid of all

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.100 
them into a container you get rid of all
the<00:04:46.280> stems<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:46.970> leaves<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.750> stalks

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
all up and you start the very macerator

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.270 
all up and you start the very macerator
and<00:04:53.000> then<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.720> press<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.830> the

and then you press them and and the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.830 
and then you press them and and the
juice<00:04:55.790> comes<00:04:55.940> off<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:58.130> just<00:04:58.550> such<00:04:59.540> an

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
juice comes off and it's just such an

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.250 
juice comes off and it's just such an
extraordinary<00:05:00.470> thing<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.520> most<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.570> is

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
extraordinary thing and most of it is

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.230 
extraordinary thing and most of it is
attributed<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:04.040> one<00:05:04.280> thing<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.880> that's

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
attributed to one thing and that's

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.260 
attributed to one thing and that's
gravity<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:07.010> greatness<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.580> gravity<00:05:08.090> is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
gravity and the greatness of gravity is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.050 
gravity and the greatness of gravity is
that<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.570> takes<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.410> pure<00:05:09.710> juice<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.790> grape

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
that it takes the pure juice of a grape

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.260 
that it takes the pure juice of a grape
and<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.720> allows<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.440> drain<00:05:12.919> away<00:05:12.950> in<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:14.060> very

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
and it allows it to drain away in a very

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.810 
and it allows it to drain away in a very
very<00:05:14.540> pure<00:05:14.810> form<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.979> that's<00:05:16.370> what<00:05:16.669> my

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
very pure form and and that's what my

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.790 
very pure form and and that's what my
wines<00:05:17.030> gonna<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.419> all<00:05:17.479> about<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:18.169> pure<00:05:18.470> form

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
wines gonna be all about the pure form

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.060 
wines gonna be all about the pure form
