00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.659
 this tower 2010 we are in the company of mr mauro toniolatti of the group 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.079
 Idrocentro 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.079
 to hear and often talk about wood as an energy source for the 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.140
 heating hector you what you propose between your company 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.689
 we don't know company we offer a series of products that can burn 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.510
 fillegno with low emissions 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.440
 remaining largely under the requirements of the regulatory 1 2 today in 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.490
 piedmont that one of the most restrictive 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.610
 we can burn wood producing heat even with 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.590
 huge savings to other sources of other sources can fossil fuels 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 eni today the various considered 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 many years ago it was predominantly used for heating 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.030
 reconsidered ogive because it is a source of economic heat that it respects 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.670
 the environment and that allows a high comfort in the home 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.680
 here are great forms we can use to burn in our signings at auction 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.030
 heating systems in our heat sources 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.430
 and what is the best type for the future 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.270
 we can burn traditional wood in wood-fired boilers like 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.550
 it was used once with pieces of wood 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.650
 then self-produced 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.510
 the advantage is that it is very cheap 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.230
 and yet at the same time some maintenance 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.819
 labor requirement by the user 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.220
 or we can use at leather 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.690
 that a product kept from wood waste is a product 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.219
 I would say ideal because of its very regular grain size 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.390
 due to its low moisture content because it is a product that allows the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 boilers to be automatic then automatic ignition modulation of the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
 power according to requirements 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:19.349
 and finally and we can burn wood chips that are nothing but waste wood 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.789
 ground a large hard metria a little coarser than the skin but anyway 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.939
 it allows us to use it in automatically operated boilers 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.249
 automatic ignition 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.589
 perfect thank you for your availability, see you next time 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.879
 good morning 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:38.519
