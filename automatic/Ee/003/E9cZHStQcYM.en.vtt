hey guys I'm back for this week's video

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.470 
hey guys I'm back for this week's video
on<00:00:04.440> whether<00:00:04.920> it's<00:00:05.130> progress<00:00:05.490> firmly<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.299> their

on whether it's progress firmly on their

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.110 
on whether it's progress firmly on their
project<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.049> my<00:00:07.140> self<00:00:07.740> defense<00:00:08.010> relations<00:00:08.550> so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
project on my self defense relations so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.780 
project on my self defense relations so
this<00:00:09.540> weekend<00:00:09.990> I've<00:00:10.200> been<00:00:10.410> working<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.099> custom

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
this weekend I've been working on custom

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.620 
this weekend I've been working on custom
gesture<00:00:12.179> recognition<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.830> far<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
gesture recognition so far in the

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.120 
gesture recognition so far in the
simulation<00:00:15.630> they<00:00:16.049> connect<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.680> picking<00:00:17.010> up

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
simulation they connect to be picking up

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.730 
simulation they connect to be picking up
the<00:00:17.609> user<00:00:17.970> there<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.840> certain<00:00:19.350> technique

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the user there was the certain technique

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790 
the user there was the certain technique
that<00:00:20.039> I've<00:00:20.580> been<00:00:21.029> creating<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> animation<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that I've been creating the animation to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.970 
that I've been creating the animation to
teach<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.990> also<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
teach them so it's also going to be a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.419 
teach them so it's also going to be a
custom<00:00:26.789> kind<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.300> movement<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.740> had<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
custom kind of movement and I had to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.990 
custom kind of movement and I had to
create<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:31.009> custom<00:00:32.540> gesture<00:00:34.190> recognition<00:00:35.190> file

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
create a custom gesture recognition file

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
create a custom gesture recognition file
and<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> would<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and so that it would now it was on the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400 
and so that it would now it was on the
right<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> give<00:00:39.480> feedback<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> user

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
right one and give feedback to the user

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.330 
right one and give feedback to the user
telling<00:00:40.739> them<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.100> were<00:00:41.190> down

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
telling them that they were down

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.410 
telling them that they were down
learning<00:00:41.610> movement<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.719> I've<00:00:43.320> been<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
learning movement so I've been kind of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.670 
learning movement so I've been kind of
spending<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.629> today<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.260> researching

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
spending the go today just researching

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.950 
spending the go today just researching
this<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> found<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.210> few<00:00:48.360> things<00:00:48.629> I've

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this and there I found a few things I've

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
this and there I found a few things I've
been<00:00:48.989> trying<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.649> loads<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> different<00:00:50.640> things

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
been trying it loads of different things

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.770 
been trying it loads of different things
so<00:00:51.440> though<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:53.070> three<00:00:53.610> days<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> walk<00:00:54.120> taught<00:00:54.629> me

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so though to three days a walk taught me

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.549 
so though to three days a walk taught me
to<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.350> now<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.570> I'll<00:00:57.570> show<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.780> let's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
see I'll show you the movement the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
see I'll show you the movement the
gesture<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.120> created<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.949> how<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gesture that I created and how it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.179 
gesture that I created and how it
recognizes<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.299> playing<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
recognizes so it's playing here so this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
recognizes so it's playing here so this
is<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.520> movement<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> character

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is my movement you can see the character

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.399 
is my movement you can see the character
my<00:01:10.229> own<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.510> it'll<00:01:12.510> start<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> clock

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
my own so it'll start down on the clock

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.770 
my own so it'll start down on the clock
now<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> comes

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
now and you can see here when it comes

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.340 
now and you can see here when it comes
up<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:22.189> yeah<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.810> different

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
up so yeah so you can see the different

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.370 
up so yeah so you can see the different
joints<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.040> moving<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> x<00:01:27.000> y&amp;z<00:01:27.570> axis<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
joints are moving and the x y&amp;z axis and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.859 
joints are moving and the x y&amp;z axis and
how<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.130> obtained<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.270> telling<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> whether

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
how its obtained and telling you whether

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
how its obtained and telling you whether
it's<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.400> go

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it's on right or not so there we go

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
it's on right or not so there we go
there's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> plug<00:01:33.420> negative<00:01:34.290> comes<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:34.950> bingo

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
there's a plug negative comes up bingo

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.590 
there's a plug negative comes up bingo
that<00:01:36.090> tells<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:36.869> many<00:01:36.930> times<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.530> done

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
that tells you how many times it's done

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
that tells you how many times it's done
so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.870 
so
like<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> yes<00:01:43.470> old<00:01:43.740> twice<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.549> it'll

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
like there and yes old twice and it'll

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
like there and yes old twice and it'll
keep<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.720> it'll<00:01:45.840> keep<00:01:46.080> building<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
keep down and it'll keep building up so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
keep down and it'll keep building up so
it's<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.070> shown<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.119> actually

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it's just shown that it's actually

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's just shown that it's actually
picking<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.280> movement<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> was

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
picking up that movement that I was

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.920 
picking up that movement that I was
saying<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.720> watch<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.550> right<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:53.930> so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
saying this watch is the right now so

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:06.789 
saying this watch is the right now so
that's<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> plugin<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.520> made<00:01:58.400> strike<00:01:59.400> two

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.800 

so<00:02:07.340> should<00:02:07.549> play<00:02:07.729> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so should play that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.750 
so should play that
to<00:02:12.510> strike<00:02:13.510> two<00:02:14.790> here<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:17.400> taste<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.550> my

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
to strike two here so taste is my

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.460 
to strike two here so taste is my
movements<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.690> buddy<00:02:19.900> again<00:02:20.200> so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
movements from like buddy again so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.260 
movements from like buddy again so
you'll<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.130> know<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.670> was<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> front<00:02:22.120> of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
you'll see you know it was the front of

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.920 
you'll see you know it was the front of
strike<00:02:22.709> there<00:02:23.709> we<00:02:23.800> go<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.160> recognize<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.780> this

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
strike there we go I recognize so this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.330 
strike there we go I recognize so this
is<00:02:26.080> just<00:02:26.200> me<00:02:26.380> playing<00:02:26.560> back<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> animation

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
is just me playing back the animation

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.990 
is just me playing back the animation
and<00:02:27.880> I'm<00:02:28.600> going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.840> pause<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.319> video<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and I'm going to pause the video and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
and I'm going to pause the video and
stand<00:02:31.000> up<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> pool<00:02:31.780> account<00:02:32.140> because<00:02:32.470> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
stand up and do a pool account because I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
stand up and do a pool account because I
have<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> headset<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.220> right<00:02:33.400> now<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:34.420> you'll

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
have the headset on right now so you'll

00:02:34.930 --> 00:03:19.699 
have the headset on right now so you'll
see<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.620> second<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.830> okay

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.500 

so<00:03:20.250> as<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.549> could<00:03:20.670> see<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:21.209> when<00:03:21.480> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
so as you could see there when I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.149 
so as you could see there when I
understand<00:03:22.019> up<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.409> down<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.680> government's

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
understand up and down the government's

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.210 
understand up and down the government's
it<00:03:23.370> was<00:03:23.610> picking<00:03:24.239> up<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.680> same<00:03:25.680> movements

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it was picking up the same movements

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.369 
it was picking up the same movements
that<00:03:26.400> came<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.510> plane<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.900> animation

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
that came up on this plane the animation

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.460 
that came up on this plane the animation
so<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.099> can<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.909> works<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.360> when<00:03:31.140> I

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
so you can see that it works and when I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.220 
so you can see that it works and when I
have<00:03:32.269> disappoint<00:03:33.269> into<00:03:34.730> into<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.819> simulation

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
have disappoint into into the simulation

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.720 
have disappoint into into the simulation
that<00:03:37.230> they<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.650> pick<00:03:37.859> up<00:03:37.950> their<00:03:38.129> movements

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that they will pick up their movements

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.710 
that they will pick up their movements
and<00:03:39.319> set<00:03:40.319> flags<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:42.030> allowed<00:03:42.299> users

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
and set flags so that it allowed users

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
and set flags so that it allowed users
stay<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> movement<00:03:43.470> correctly<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.189> be

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
stay on the movement correctly and I be

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.399 
stay on the movement correctly and I be
able<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.549> give<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.879> as<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:44.970> feedback<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.379> I

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
able to give to you as a feedback so I

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:53.330 
able to give to you as a feedback so I
see<00:03:47.310> here's<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> local<00:03:48.689> story<00:03:48.930> animation<00:03:52.340> so

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
see here's the local story animation so

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.970 
see here's the local story animation so
it's<00:03:53.549> picking<00:03:53.700> up<00:03:53.909> all<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.349> axes<00:03:55.349> here<00:03:55.379> of<00:03:55.739> the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
it's picking up all the axes here of the

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.339 
it's picking up all the axes here of the
joints<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:02.420> when<00:04:03.420> you're<00:04:03.540> making<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.019> you

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
joints see when you're making this you

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.289 
joints see when you're making this you
have<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.799> keep<00:04:05.220> your<00:04:05.400> feet<00:04:05.579> in<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> mill<00:04:05.970> and

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
have to keep your feet in the mill and

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.149 
have to keep your feet in the mill and
set<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> keyframes<00:04:07.290> couple<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.980> times

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
set the keyframes couple of times

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.099 
set the keyframes couple of times
because<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:09.359> doesn't<00:04:09.599> pick<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.840> up<00:04:09.930> all<00:04:10.079> the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
because it doesn't pick it up all the

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.660 
because it doesn't pick it up all the
time<00:04:10.170> they<00:04:10.470> picked<00:04:10.680> up<00:04:10.799> their<00:04:11.099> boot<00:04:11.400> didn't

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
time they picked up their boot didn't

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.030 
time they picked up their boot didn't
pick<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:11.909> up<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.269> go<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.900> Florida<00:04:13.230> because

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
pick it up to go to Florida because

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.920 
pick it up to go to Florida because
every<00:04:14.430> user<00:04:14.609> will<00:04:15.030> move<00:04:15.450> there<00:04:15.659> from<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
every user will move there from the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.719 
every user will move there from the
everyone's<00:04:16.320> body<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:16.709> different<00:04:16.859> way<00:04:17.459> they're

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
everyone's body is different way they're

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.729 
everyone's body is different way they're
from<00:04:17.910> Wales<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.359> different<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.470> to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
from Wales is different so you have to

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.189 
from Wales is different so you have to
kind<00:04:19.979> of<00:04:20.070> make<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.519> up<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:21.030> everyone<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.840> to

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
kind of make it up to everyone and to

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.290 
kind of make it up to everyone and to
connect<00:04:22.500> isn't<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.639> best<00:04:23.849> piece<00:04:24.060> of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
connect isn't very the best piece of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.779 
connect isn't very the best piece of
hardware<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.199> it's<00:04:25.349> not<00:04:25.560> gonna<00:04:25.770> people<00:04:26.160> at

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
hardware and it's not gonna people at

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.820 
hardware and it's not gonna people at
emotions<00:04:27.419> hundred-percent<00:04:28.260> perfectly<00:04:28.770> you

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
emotions hundred-percent perfectly you

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.890 
emotions hundred-percent perfectly you
can<00:04:28.949> see<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.610> kind<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.120> drops<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.539> the<00:04:30.720> next

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
can see it kind of drops it the next

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.170 
can see it kind of drops it the next
time<00:04:30.960> sometimes<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.610> body<00:04:32.789> moves

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
time sometimes and the body moves

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.830 
time sometimes and the body moves
outward<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.650> kind<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.949> ensures<00:04:35.310> that

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
outward so this kind of ensures that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.969 
outward so this kind of ensures that
even<00:04:36.840> though<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.110> if<00:04:37.349> they<00:04:37.500> mess<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
even though that if they mess with the

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.629 
even though that if they mess with the
sloppy<00:04:38.220> does<00:04:38.669> pick<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.389> up<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.490> next

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
sloppy does pick it up so in the next

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.330 
sloppy does pick it up so in the next
video<00:04:41.849> hopefully<00:04:42.210> I'll<00:04:42.659> have<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.800> same<00:04:44.010> built

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
video hopefully I'll have the same built

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.159 
video hopefully I'll have the same built
a<00:04:44.580> bit<00:04:45.300> more<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.979> glue<00:04:47.699> together<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
a bit more kind of glue together for the

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.310 
a bit more kind of glue together for the
rift<00:04:50.159> and<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.820> connect<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.720> say<00:04:51.900> look<00:04:52.169> I'm

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
rift and to connect and to say look I'm

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.279 
rift and to connect and to say look I'm
pretty<00:04:52.650> in<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.039> animation<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:54.510> that's<00:04:54.960> kinda

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
pretty in the animation so that's kinda

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.400 
pretty in the animation so that's kinda
the<00:04:55.320> next

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
the next

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.070 
the next
and<00:04:56.560> keeping<00:04:57.220> my<00:04:57.370> eye<00:04:57.400> on<00:04:57.550> will<00:04:58.420> we<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.050> a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
and keeping my eye on will we have a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.480 
and keeping my eye on will we have a
month<00:04:59.350> left<00:04:59.500> to<00:05:00.780> submit<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.460> hopefully<00:05:03.460> I

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
month left to submit this so hopefully I

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.580 
month left to submit this so hopefully I
have<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.670> completed<00:05:04.060> project<00:05:04.480> by<00:05:04.630> then<00:05:04.810> thanks

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
have a completed project by then thanks

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.510 
have a completed project by then thanks
for<00:05:05.740> watching<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.340> hopefully<00:05:06.880> see<00:05:07.240> you<00:05:07.270> soon
