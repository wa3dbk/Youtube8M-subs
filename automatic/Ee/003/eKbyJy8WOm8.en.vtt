00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:22.250
 and they are that on board 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.880
 The canisters will be shooting for 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 natural sos porpoises in not 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.099
 performed heinz kolling here in the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.380
 red jacket tunes me to that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:42.870
 interview that outside on deck 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:45.149
 should be led wherever are 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.750
 porpoises on concrete where the most easterly 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.460
 maybe as her form that pictures 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 the many dare how many times do you have 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.719
 see how long you have the book 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.850
 perhaps accompanies and should history 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 in principle that asks 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 exactly but I am not the question 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 ruble 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.020
 but first and again 23 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.259
 and the 3 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.680
 times 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 because of the process 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.200
 unfortunately we have a lot of fog and 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 can only contact us with the instruments 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.660
 slowly shimmy on the baltic sea 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.960
 You have to be happy that it is not too 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.200
 still raining and at least lothar succeed 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.160
 some nice shots from work 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.160
 of the camera team 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.010
 but a word about the weather the Baltic Sea 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.700
 has a water temperature of just 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:09.109
 three degrees and the warmer air 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:12.290
 Of course, that's what causes mist 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.319
 Spirit level have barely been 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.400
 but now try not determined 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.120
 all 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.120
 nice on 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.730
 already one is wiser of the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.300
 music world 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.300
 times 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.560
 than are 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.319
 it is true 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.910
 Michael moore 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.030
 2 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030
 3 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.120
 counting 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.310
 the danger consists of 34 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.160
 conducts and then can 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.280
 you get better 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.730
 knows what the water games 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.659
 With 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.659
 as sufficient 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.560
 I want 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.470
 our seal happened to come already clean 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.500
 turn it off again and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.920
 Well, you take it 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.920
 between 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.230
 that works very well 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.030
 Karas with 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.030
 rich ling 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.319
 Well 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:57.419
 oh so now is completely forgotten 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:58.889
 The title was so with the camera through 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.499
 that he starts here and moves so slowly 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.879
 a dramatic picture tastes like that 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:10.099
 You only need to talk to you once 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:14.310
 turn of panels after the challenging 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:17.270
 now with this camera I have two 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.499
 and all filmed 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.499
 the good sound retracted 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.010
 running throughout the area and 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.380
 alternately in a country radio station 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.580
 it's our turn 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.850
 We 're in the frame once a month 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.920
 men's business and then deal with us 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.920
 actually with
