00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
of thought this would be totally

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.980 
of thought this would be totally
different<00:01:13.940> from<00:01:14.030> football<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.660> found<00:01:14.870> out

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
different from football and I found out

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.690 
different from football and I found out
later<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.260> it<00:01:15.650> was<00:01:15.710> still<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.040> people<00:01:16.340> sport

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
later on it was still the people sport

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.940 
later on it was still the people sport
it<00:01:16.820> was<00:01:16.940> just<00:01:17.150> like<00:01:17.300> football<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.830> was

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
it was just like football but it was

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.290 
it was just like football but it was
totally<00:01:19.130> different<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:19.700> first<00:01:19.910> year<00:01:20.060> we<00:01:20.180> had

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
totally different that first year we had

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.720 
totally different that first year we had
17<00:01:20.780> people<00:01:21.229> working<00:01:21.260> on<00:01:21.740> one<00:01:21.979> race<00:01:22.160> car

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.780 

I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.480> way<00:01:27.600> he<00:01:27.630> does<00:01:27.870> it<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.440> know

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
I think the way he does it you know

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.220 
I think the way he does it you know
methodically<00:01:29.790> picks<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.180> people<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> tries

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
methodically picks out people and tries

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.560 
methodically picks out people and tries
to<00:01:31.260> get<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.860> people<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.090> places

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to get the right people to right places

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
to get the right people to right places
and<00:01:33.720> does<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.200> carefully<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:37.470> doesn't<00:01:37.770> do

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and does it carefully it doesn't do

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.190 
and does it carefully it doesn't do
anything<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.850> quick<00:01:39.180> reaction

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.920

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
to be in a big group where we could

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.120

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
so far paid off yes I think that's a

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.540 
so far paid off yes I think that's a
point<00:04:37.080> we're<00:04:37.290> seeing<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.800> as<00:04:37.950> a<00:04:37.979> formula<00:04:38.520> for

Finney<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.340> Kurt<00:04:41.700> Busch<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.210> think<00:04:42.389> we're

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
Finney and Kurt Busch I think we're

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.360

the<00:05:35.910> potential<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.479> be<00:05:36.630> number<00:05:36.810> 1<00:05:37.080> with<00:05:37.260> jimmy

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the potential to be number 1 with jimmy

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.070 
the potential to be number 1 with jimmy
johnson<00:05:38.099> and<00:05:38.280> certainly<00:05:39.060> Jeff<00:05:39.270> Gordon<00:05:39.690> but

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
johnson and certainly Jeff Gordon but

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.659 
johnson and certainly Jeff Gordon but
