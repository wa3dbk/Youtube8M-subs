00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello you all right here's how 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.670
 open up the secret of weight loss and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.369
 In this video I want to talk to you. 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.600
 each time you climb on top of the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.510
 balance 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.750
 I do not know if you know I even made one 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.420
 This video is not about the scale and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 I do not know if you know but the scale is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.510
 The big village is the shanty town that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 your weight loss and you have not 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 their need already stopped to think 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.319
 I'll explain it now because 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 balance is the big villain if you will see how 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.219
 The reason is very simple for you. 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.210
 abandon it once and how your 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.609
 ripening 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.549
 very possibly will stay until very 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.690
 quieter, much more effective and 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:56.399
 much easier probably see only 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 A lot of people talk to me like this. 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.839
 feel when I climb the scale and I 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.290
 I realize I lost weight 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.619
 I get so happy so happy that there I 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.260
 I allow small pleasures I 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 I allow you to eat a few things that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820
 I was not eating out one knows 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.290
 bit of my diet from my 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.250
 nutritional education 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 I give maybe a little time in the activity 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.340
 physics I was coming in rhythm 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 focused there some pauses and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.770
 When I see, yes, I did. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.430
 get fat when I see you recover 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 That's a lot of money. 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.880
 another scenario are those people who 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.410
 rises in the balance and realize that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.010
 they have lost what they do 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.460
 You see, I do not lose weight, you see me. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.290
 killed, I tried so hard I 'm 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 leading to overcome the series in my diet 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.440
 but look at the scales hand not 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.260
 did not move anything or I just lose weight and that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.510
 so I'm doing so much activity 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.430
 physical and what the person does in that 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.819
 scenery this scenario 2 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.220
 she gives a little relax too 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.170
 losing focus ends up losing that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.989
 determination with the process of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.319
 lose weight and stray a little 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.260
 of the route that was coming 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.280
 so much dedication to the body 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.099
 wanted 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.469
 then those two scenarios both that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.959
 person who becomes thinner and 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.599
 slimmed and give a little go 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.790
 celebrate as the one who realizes that 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.790
 that he gave his best and did not 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.290
 lost weight and become frustrated and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.530
 stick your foot in the jackfruit 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.620
 are two typical scenarios that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.419
 does not favor that it does not help at all who 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 want to lose weight 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.700
 The question I ask is what are the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.129
 other signs that you may have which 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.560
 are the other flags that go 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.260
 favor you to see if you are in the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.760
 correct path or not in the journey of 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 weight loss 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.379
 I always like it, I'll make you one. 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.980
 question but I like it now I'll go 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.449
 Answer there and I always like 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.739
 challenge the people who come to me and 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:18.829
 talk like that to you instead of 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.699
 weigh rather than step on the scale you 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.979
 chase after compliments that people 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:28.479
 to realize that you really are 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:31.099
 It is not much better to lose weight 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:33.889
 interesting even suddenly your 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.769
 mother your husband your son your sister 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.489
 Whoever it is that will watch you talk 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.250
 like this 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.590
 Wow you are different is more 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.599
 skinny are you doing something to 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.269
 to lose weight, right? 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.120
 praises also tell 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.709
 excellent indicators that your 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.650
 process is working 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.470
 or better still separates some 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.569
 pieces of clothing maybe those pants that 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.609
 It's been a while since you've entered that 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.729
 dress that is a little too fair 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.780
 on the waist that shorts that shirt 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:10.519
 I finally separated some pieces of clothing and 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.189
 use the as flags that you 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.439
 it's losing weight is also excellent 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:19.099
 or you can still take action 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:22.460
 measurement of your waist from your hip 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:24.830
 Your thigh in your arm works, too. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.820
 very well what I want to make clear 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.150
 here is the following the balance she can 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.880
 put everything to waste all your effort 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.460
 the course and in vain one to have so much success 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.590
 so you do not have the results that 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.810
 Do you really want to because the scale? 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.830
 can disrupt this story this 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.200
 journey 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.730
 And if you're a woman, you're 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.330
 watching me, we can not 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.790
 disregard also that we have the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:57.080
 hormonal oscillation fluid retention 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.660
 it's not pre-menstrual period then everything 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.060
 This ends up appearing on the 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.190
 balance and does not necessarily mean 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.860
 that your weight loss process does not 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.020
 Maybe it's a moment in the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.030
 What day are you thinking maybe 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.870
 be a day so propitious for you to climb 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.410
 on the scale 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.510
 Now it's only important, I do not 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.970
 I'm denying that it's important to you. 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.140
 have signs know if you are on the way 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.890
 correct or not 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.420
 even for you to reevaluate your journey is 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.300
 important to know if you are 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.730
 thinning or not more than one way or 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.800
 other you have other ways to 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.170
 to see if you are succeeding and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.850
 positive results not necessarily 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.760
 just the scale 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.980
 seek praise for recognition 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.920
 people realize that you are 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.100
 I lost a few pieces of 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.440
 clothes and goes on experiencing these pieces and 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.410
 realizing if you are losing weight or 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.340
 not as well as take your measurements 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.160
 now the balance there are those who say the survey 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.400
 people have told me people who are 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.710
 in this area of aid to others 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.500
 people who want to lose weight people 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.290
 tell me the following nec they already told me 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.110
 cynthia I do not weigh myself I only weight 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.630
 when the doctor when the doctor speaks for 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.360
 Please, if I may, I'd like to take your measure. 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.030
 I want to see how much you weigh yourself, I do not 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.760
 weight because the balance she finishes me 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.890
 messing up she messes with my love 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.660
 if I'm happy I climb on the scale I 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.910
 I'm sad, is not it? 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.650
 so the balance it even brings 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.230
 negative thoughts 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.240
 I'm giving it my best, I'm doing it 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.820
 what can I do physical activity 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.280
 taking care of my food by changing the 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.639
 behavior but I go home I see how 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.729
 to lose what I wanted and then I'll kick it 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:51.069
 today I give that relaxed even then 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.770
 For you, who wants to lose weight, I want to 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:56.020
 say that you do not have the 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.810
 balance need 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.919
 put aside your balance puts on top 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.219
 of the closet 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.990
 I give your balance to someone else 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:08.349
 do anything or even if 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:11.259
 You want to regret it, you lose every 30 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:14.439
 days every 45 days 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:17.259
 follow focus with determination on behalf of 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:19.750
 desired results but I eat one 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.740
 I want to lose weight 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:26.710
 make it clear to you that you do not 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.550
 need the balance ok you do not need 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.279
 her 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.789
 seek praise for recognition 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:36.159
 by the people who live together 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:38.949
 who are unaware that they are there in the 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:42.069
 your routine and you will surely notice 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:44.379
 yes you are losing weight separates 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:45.460
 some pieces of clothing or even pull 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:49.240
 your measurements 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.300
 ok its a simple easy tip and it goes 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.849
 depend on you to change the behavior and 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.460
 leave the balance aside that says 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:58.689
 so I can not detach myself from the 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.110
 balance 

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:04.750
 Every day you ask me and this sucks. 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.089
 if this is the case, strive for the 

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:09.129
 changing this behavior leaves the balance 

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:11.529
 sideways and will be much happier 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:14.399
 Okay, a big kiss for you, and we'll get together. 

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:14.399
 are you bye bye
