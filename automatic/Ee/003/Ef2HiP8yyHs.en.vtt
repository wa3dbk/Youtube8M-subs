00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.700
 in the music laughs and cries 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.029
 at the same time the music is sad and 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.759
 At the same time we name everything we like 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.150
 people without music can not do 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:32.490
 that's what the school does to the mine of the animal 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.490
 particular situations 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.510
 the story of the schubert sonaten 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 and the public is a very 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.450
 interesting story only two of them 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.120
 the little addo and the gedo back then 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.910
 called fantasy drive in his 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.860
 Lifetime printed everything is roof load 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:13.510
 a whole 19 century has been shoving 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.510
 Sonata totally ignored 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 it is schreiber to speak music because 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 one only speaks about our action 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.070
 the music and not the music 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.080
 even if I explain something 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.910
 School for the Nazis then I would have you 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.210
 can not play anymore so you can not 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.410
 I can only do so from my personal 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:54.480
 Example say it is an epiphany 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.750
 the journey of wealth the harmonious 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.750
 want 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.020
 I believe that every composer has 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 a medium of being, so to speak 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.720
 personal diary is beethoven 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.880
 Diary are not the symphonies are 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.650
 the piano sonata now has the quartets 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.020
 not with the quality but one man 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.120
 has the feeling that's really his 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.490
 service at the user are the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.450
 piano concerts and not the sonatas 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.720
 and the mozart da ponte operas and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.160
 you always think unfairly how you think 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 songs because they are so run through 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 whole short but whole life 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.989
 chamber music but I think they are 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 piano sonatas too and I have now 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.370
 I included all perfected sonatas 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.130
 I did not play and finish 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.600
 our arguments because it is too complicated 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.850
 and I really wanted this one 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.630
 line have for me and also for that 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.830
 audience of the development of 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.780
 shove with perfected pieces of the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.769
 first sonata until last 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.700
 and it is a highly interesting and 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.700
 exciting journey
