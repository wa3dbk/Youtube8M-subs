00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 it's not even in the oven so nothing can be 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 do if you do not have a lot of skill 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.900
 with kitchens you'll be able to win 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.840
 It's that it 's so easy, I have it. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 okay with me then and then we'll 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.049
 begin 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 mixing half a can of condensed milk 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 with 200 grams of milk powder in the case of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 no milk is 100 grams of chocolate 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 powder you can replace with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 I drink chocolate but it will get a little 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.560
 plus 12 mix and then add 1 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.360
 4 cup milk and mix well it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 It is to form a sticky mass're well 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.460
 then we will take this mass to the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 So if you let it go for a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 better hour we did not put butter 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.619

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.870

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.390
 Brigadier Brigadier who is not from 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.300

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.050
 now I'm going to melt the chocolate 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.510
 microwaves do not want a 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.800
 bittersweet chocolate and I'll leave it 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.080

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.230

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.750

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
 stir shot not burn if I saw it not 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.359
 It was going to take a little over 30 seconds. 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.459
 I'm shooting to stop it completely. 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.160
 already the motorcycle as the chocolate melts and 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.170

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:32.730
 here in the middle and with the heat of this 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.730
 chocolate will see if this can not 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.990
 Stop messing around, you better do it. 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.669
 chocolate brigadier like that customer 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.930
 Look, I only did it with my mother. 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:56.010

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:59.240

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.240
 granulated in chocolate 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 now is to throw the chocolate up here 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.349
 of the cures and today pass the chocolate 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.750
 two sides of the heart we'll take 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.030
 refrigerate until chocolate hardens and 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.669
 after shining 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.879
 Good people, I wrapped the wafers and 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.270
 here is that paper is transparent not 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.919
 I could see transparent because otherwise 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.050
 I will not be able to because that role is 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.819
 medium and not completely transparent 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.279
 intense to be done so 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:42.729
 So I think it looks pretty cute and 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.729
 there folks 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:48.169

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.340
 cheap and I put the candies 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.620
 In here you have a note and roll 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.550
