00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
telling them apart but I think andrew is

the<00:02:05.790> point<00:02:06.030> guard<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> 66<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.890> guard

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the point guard and for a 66 point guard

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.499 
the point guard and for a 66 point guard
he's<00:02:08.310> definitely<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> problem

and I think Aaron

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.240 
and I think Aaron
