00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.770
 such a bible is a temporary one 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.830
 movable home 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.810
 syria wanted to build joke but in last 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.810
 in a day at a location of your choice 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.590
 and the intention is that it is placed 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.530
 be used on unused land 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.990
 young go sometimes households there 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.960
 can live temporarily that can be green 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.090
 belong to ourselves but also to municipalities 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 and housing corporations or others 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.750
 developers 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.480
 he therefore we use for years 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.850
 plots of land on a very sustainable basis 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.330
 way and we help to grab that time 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.330
 the target group 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.270
 he is the housing market for the target group 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.100
 super tricky if you are in for example 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.660
 Amsterdam offers both rent via go 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.760
 look at an attic room of sixteen 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.520
 square meters for 700 euros per month 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.239
 and there are 88 people with you 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.410
 queue 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.030
 so those two problems where i 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.850
 merged and for that we have 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.560
 heijmans one came up with one of the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.990
 basic idea of ​​this property is already 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.650
 been to feel positive about it 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.590
 bring 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 height space light nice view with 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.070
 such projects are way of the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 taking the first step into another 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.250
 way of thinking than purely the fixing 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.250
 to build 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.800
 special and heijmans one is it 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.259
 actually a temporary solution 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.790
 but in terms of quality not inferior 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.790
 definitive house 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 it is of course a whole new concept 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.340
 I am very proud I have almost 2000 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.060
 houses worked and this is real 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060
 something special
