00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the the when he started in terms of the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.880 
the the when he started in terms of the
peace<00:02:56.910> thing<00:02:57.180> oh<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.630> god<00:02:57.900> mr.<00:02:58.200> Hughes<00:02:58.560> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
Peace Corps and and also I think in just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.870 
Peace Corps and and also I think in just
terms<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.470> liberalism<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.620> using<00:03:05.370> government

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
terms of liberalism and using government

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.810 
terms of liberalism and using government
as<00:03:06.440> representation<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> people<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.670> do

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
as representation of the people to do

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.550 
as representation of the people to do
good<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.510> general<00:03:09.870> welfare<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.350> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
good for the general welfare and to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.370 
good for the general welfare and to
create<00:03:10.920> equality<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.880> opportunity<00:03:12.570> but

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
create equality of opportunity but

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.240 
create equality of opportunity but
nevertheless<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:16.110> JFK<00:03:16.650> thing<00:03:17.100> has

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
nevertheless I think that JFK thing has

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220 
nevertheless I think that JFK thing has
something<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.610> do<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.790> him<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.209> also<00:03:18.690> think

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
something to do with him I also think

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.949
