00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.190
 the falcon nautical stands are very light 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 are easy to assemble and have an excellent 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.840
 cost benefit ratio 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.760
 This one I'm going to show falcon 3 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.539
 but the fao with 2 is a falcon four are 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:39.059
 similar to nautical fao against 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:41.040
 fine fiberglass rods here 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.059
 the way the rods are attached to the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.059
 tent structure 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.000
 see that the tent has a good area 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 for the most fragile materials and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 light 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.960
 the tent is easier to put together a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:40.860
 detail of mosquito net and door as 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:46.350
 that had been elected five pieces 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.440
 plastic to help the attention here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.030
 details of the sun's door the ceiling is arrested 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.950
 with velcro the zipper is protected from water 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.940
 with this part here has an elastic for 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.760
 inside the mosquito net door a 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.620
 of the passenger compartment and the overhead 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.679
 there is a small area of advancement but it is 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.030
 too small 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.550
 Maybe you can wear a pair of sneakers. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.560
 here some dirty pan but not much 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.340
 thing 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 repair the bottom of the tent a small 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.030
 air entrance 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.630
 there are side pockets also in the two 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.630
 sides 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.640
 despite the fragility this tent has 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.100
 very small weight that is one thing 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.769
 that many people take into account in 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.739
 time to walk or take a trip 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.170
 bicycle for example a tent 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.060
 with slightly lighter material 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.890
 it is also much easier to mount 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.790
 I set up this tent very quickly and 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.459
 alone the water column in this tent 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.700
 only 800mm but like it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.470
 has a roof and also has 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.560
 cordelets for fixing on ceiling 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.170
 I believe she supports winds 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.930
 reasonable and a good amount of rain 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 um maybe she does not support rain 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.830
 continuous for many days 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.140
 but for the weekend it's okay 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.060
 possible that it is very efficient with 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.819
 good luck still getting a heavy rain 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.080
 today to test this tent 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:33.300
 the time closed is very windy 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.930
 waiting for the rain to go missing 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.209
 good 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.209
 it's too damn windy 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.560
 the worst of the wind has passed but it is still 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.640
 Thrilling has already spoken with the mother also has 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.640
 to see if there was no water in there 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:37.760
 the ba and cut everywhere it rains a lot 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:42.590
 strong dry 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.590
 see details here of wet subteto 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.900
 but nothing passing into the tent 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.090
 little details that show the door 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:59.830
 lantern and this farm bar for good 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.530
 saw I did not expect it to be 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.419
 I thought she was going to break the 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.940
 convent sticks 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.820
 it is clear that a stronger rod you 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.350
 will be safer but if you do not 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.789
 You have a lot of money to pay your 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.500
 tent that will handle a good end of 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.910
 week 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.580
 maybe she can not stand the rain 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.190
 prolonged because it has only 800 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:31.720
 thousand clean water column but at the end 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:33.340
 From the week you can face the mountain logo 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.250
 tent started to rain it did not work 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.530
 show many details here is a 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.229
 ventilation opening to prevent 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.470
 condensation inside the tent over the 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.750
 Polyester roof weathered well and 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.539
 stakes if they show in sufficient numbers 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.550
 as long as you wear the jackets 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.860
 despite the fiber rods he very much 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.720
 fragile in my opinion and came a 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.099
 moment that I found that the rods 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.060
 and break because the wind was very 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.130
 strong 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.740
 the tent resisted well within three hours of 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.099
 rain being two hours of rain 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.099
 very intense 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.720
 if you do not have much money to 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.449
 camping can be a good option for you 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.270
 a falcon model two or three or 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.949
 even the falcon four hours ever 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.639
 what possible is it interesting you buy 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:27.370
 a tent a little stronger material 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.080
 especially the rods and what 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.840
 It showed very interesting in this tent. 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.360
 is the presence of the cordelistas of fixation 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.220
 from the roof a tent without cordeletes 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.479
 it is very difficult to resist strong winds 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.610
 as it stood, is a tent with a 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.199
 good value for money if this 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.300
 video was useful for you to know this 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.889
