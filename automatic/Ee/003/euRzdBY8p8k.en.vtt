00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.890
 game section or our channel of x 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.310
 10 below I leave the links for 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.110
 play lego star wars gioda chronicles 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.590
 which is the game that we have to talk about 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.410
 Well, this game starts like this 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.750
 this screen this would be basically the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.739
 main menu and here we have to choose 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.890
 one side or side to start playing myself 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.860
 I will choose for example 7 and here 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.110
 we started our training here 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.060
 they tell us what planet we will start and 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.879
 others here the level learn with gioda and 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.010
 we go directly 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.500
 basically this would be the only thing 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 we have to do 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.629
 to move we have to click 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.610
 where you have indicated 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.430
 now for example we have to shoot 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.670
 for we also have to click to 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 shoot and so on 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.180
 and we shoot if you keep advancing and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.310
 we hope we keep moving forward 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.310
 it's the only thing yoga is telling us 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.420
 and here we can also change 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.539
 vehicle if we want or can buy 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.670
 more vehicles or we can do great 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.340
 variety of things we're going to leave like this 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.500
 just and we have to look for obi wan 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 do the things that says iodine to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 beginning and after when it is is not 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.460
 expert then fight 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.530
