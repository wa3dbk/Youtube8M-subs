 leave it to the room yeah you have to try 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.070
 not to be too late 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 gains because after that it's not like 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.549
 the wall ride finger after you see that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 stop in and all will stay in 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:27.350
 the question regarding what would appear I 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.350
 can and I can be the king of geeks 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.840

 anywhere the ticket no it's a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 fault 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.940
 waiting for us makes us pretty much more or 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.860
 least the same mistakes except there I believe 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:15.640
 made a mistake I lost five places 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.710
 but I do not have material costs on 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.990
 would call it 5th 5th 7th 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.790
 oh yes because I remember we are 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.480

 really do not make mistakes like that 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.310

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.430
 4 above thumb daniar but if I have 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.430
 generous people 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.669
 I wanted to aim for success in this 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.620
 turn there 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.490
 oh yeah that's the game the voice and how much 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.530
 and night yes but because on it but I am 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.390
 seventh I was not finished I press on 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:34.979
 round I saw the car at chukki 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:39.360
 Finally, the next point does though 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:42.870
 we change to gogo it's over I'm here 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.940
 can not finish second a lot of you 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.400
 could not put any more ben I do not know 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.930
 if it was 3 by default but against 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.870
 mom yeah but I had too much 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.910
 pressure when you're first you have to 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.880
 to make zero error the slightest mistake you 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.520
 second passes but more than that me 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.600
 already I was doing 9 5 classes no but 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.560
 when I make mistakes it's not 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.030
 fallen from the cliff 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.340
 when I tell you mistake is a little 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.849
 slip too much yes you pass second 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.599
 direct 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:15.959
 so hot considering the difference is that 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.959
 Manchester 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:20.949
 the unil had a custom vehicle when 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:22.659
 even he is 11th 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.699
 but that's normal guys when you 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.999
 take it all is not the same there is more 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.999
 of speed 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:36.309
 it's hard for a king to show 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:37.779
 to yes in any case there you showed that 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:40.929
 you're not the buggy king but it's 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:43.869
 just yeah that's it you want it 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:47.050
 to say but you see there were things 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:49.769
 on the first turn too many engines 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.769
 I'm improving too much
