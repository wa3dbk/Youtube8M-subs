00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
of a boost you get so if you want to

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.889 
of a boost you get so if you want to
have<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:41.010> louder<00:00:41.760> volume<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.690> playing

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
have a little louder volume for playing

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889 
have a little louder volume for playing
a<00:00:43.020> solo<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.560> for<00:00:44.220> playing<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> softer<00:00:45.090> piece<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
a solo or for playing a softer piece you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.470 
a solo or for playing a softer piece you
can<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.380> with<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.620> box

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
can do that with this box

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
can do that with this box
very<00:00:48.480> straightforward<00:00:48.870> design<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.920> really

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
very straightforward design it's really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.510 
very straightforward design it's really
designed<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:52.290> offer<00:00:52.530> any<00:00:52.770> complications

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
designed to not offer any complications

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639 
designed to not offer any complications
on<00:00:53.670> stage<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.210> features<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> might<00:00:55.140> not

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
on stage no features that you might not

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
on stage no features that you might not
need<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.980> might<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.610> complicate<00:00:57.210> matters

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
need that might just complicate matters

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.170 
need that might just complicate matters
so<00:00:58.130> basically<00:00:59.130> we<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.489> two<00:00:59.730> identical

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so basically we have two identical

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.310 
so basically we have two identical
channels<00:01:01.370> channel<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.780> quarter-inch<00:01:03.780> input

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
channels channel a quarter-inch input

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
channels channel a quarter-inch input
channel<00:01:04.680> B<00:01:04.799> quarter-inch<00:01:05.309> input<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> it's

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
channel B quarter-inch input and it's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.529 
channel B quarter-inch input and it's
really<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.350> gain<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.549> treble<00:01:09.060> control

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
really just a gain and a treble control

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.239 
really just a gain and a treble control
on<00:01:09.689> each<00:01:09.869> channel<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.469> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.590> sort<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> fine

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
on each channel so you can sort of fine

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:13.099 
on each channel so you can sort of fine
tune<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.700> instruments<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.179> little<00:01:12.479> bit<00:01:12.600> make

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
tune your instruments a little bit make

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.599 
tune your instruments a little bit make
sure<00:01:13.319> that<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:13.590> getting<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:13.829> same<00:01:14.100> volume

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
sure that you're getting the same volume

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.010 
sure that you're getting the same volume
levels<00:01:14.969> when<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.240> playing<00:01:15.450> switching

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
levels when you're playing switching

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.319 
levels when you're playing switching
back<00:01:16.139> and<00:01:16.200> forth<00:01:16.409> between<00:01:16.709> these<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.399> that's

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
back and forth between these and that's

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.419 
back and forth between these and that's
really<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.200> there's<00:01:19.889> an<00:01:20.039> effects

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
really all there is there's an effects

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.489 
really all there is there's an effects
loop<00:01:20.490> buildin<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.689> run<00:01:21.869> your<00:01:22.020> tuner

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
loop buildin so you can run your tuner

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.039 
loop buildin so you can run your tuner
or<00:01:22.679> your<00:01:23.130> reverb<00:01:23.639> or<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.479> effects

or your reverb or your other effects

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.629 
or your reverb or your other effects
right<00:01:25.499> through<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.189> need<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> go

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:26.639 
right through here don't need to go

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.219 
right through here don't need to go
inline<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.719> handy<00:01:28.109> if

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
inline with them which is handy if

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.629 
inline with them which is handy if
you're<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.649> two<00:01:28.889> instruments<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
you're going to use two instruments and

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:33.349 
you're going to use two instruments and
then<00:01:30.389> just<00:01:30.779> a<00:01:30.929> balanced<00:01:31.439> output<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.060> into

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
then just a balanced output to go into

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.910 
then just a balanced output to go into
the<00:01:33.450> PA<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> case<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.590> into<00:01:34.889> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the PA in this case I'm going into a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
the PA in this case I'm going into a
Fishman<00:01:35.340> amp<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.139> need<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.349> quarter<00:01:37.799> inch

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
Fishman amp if you need a quarter inch

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.279 
Fishman amp if you need a quarter inch

amp or something like that

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.359 
amp or something like that
you<00:01:41.969> can<00:01:42.179> use<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:42.689> send<00:01:43.349> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.829> effects<00:01:44.249> loop

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you can use the send of the effects loop

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.459 
you can use the send of the effects loop
which<00:01:44.639> is<00:01:44.969> designed<00:01:45.419> to<00:01:45.509> also<00:01:45.779> work<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.439> a

regular quarter-inch output of course
you<00:01:49.139> can't<00:01:49.349> use<00:01:49.499> that<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.039> effects<00:01:50.399> loop

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you can't use that in the effects loop

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can't use that in the effects loop
at<00:01:50.669> the<00:01:50.759> same<00:01:50.969> time<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> unit<00:01:52.859> can<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.399> powered

it's a metal box very solid switches
and<00:02:16.439> I<00:02:16.769> open<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.129> unit<00:02:17.249> up<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.849> glad<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and I open the unit up and I was glad to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
and I open the unit up and I was glad to
see<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.810> components<00:02:19.409> I<00:02:19.499> mounted

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
see that all the components I mounted

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.789 
see that all the components I mounted
directly<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.359> metal<00:02:21.569> enclosure<00:02:22.109> so<00:02:22.530> even

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
directly to the metal enclosure so even

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.349 
directly to the metal enclosure so even
if<00:02:22.889> you<00:02:22.980> drop<00:02:23.189> this<00:02:23.430> stepped<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:23.939> little<00:02:24.239> too

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
if you drop this stepped on a little too

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.550 
if you drop this stepped on a little too
heavy<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:24.659> something<00:02:24.959> like<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.109> you're<00:02:25.439> not

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
heavy or something like that you're not

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.890 
heavy or something like that you're not
going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.769> do<00:02:26.159> any<00:02:26.310> damage<00:02:26.719> internally<00:02:27.719> by

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
going to do any damage internally by

see<00:02:33.510> what<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.750> unit<00:02:34.019> sounds<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.829> don't

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
see what the unit sounds like I don't

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.949 
see what the unit sounds like I don't
have<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.159> full<00:02:35.459> set<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:36.030> two<00:02:36.329> instruments

have a full set up with two instruments

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.390 
have a full set up with two instruments
here<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.469> show<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.889> but<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.219> very

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
here to show you but it's very

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.160 
here to show you but it's very
straightforward<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:39.329> I<00:02:39.480> did<00:02:39.719> it<00:02:39.870> would<00:02:39.989> just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
straightforward if I did it would just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.629 
straightforward if I did it would just
go<00:02:40.290> back<00:02:40.439> and<00:02:40.650> forth<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.980> two<00:02:41.129> channels<00:02:41.519> are

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
go back and forth the two channels are

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.629 
go back and forth the two channels are
identical<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:42.989> going<00:02:43.139> to<00:02:43.169> plug<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.639> go

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
identical but I'm going to plug this go

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.940 
identical but I'm going to plug this go
down<00:02:44.790> multi<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.269> guitar<00:02:45.780> into<00:02:46.079> it<00:02:46.200> here<00:02:46.439> just<00:02:46.859> so

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
down multi a guitar into it here just so

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.920 
down multi a guitar into it here just so
we<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.189> kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.609> sense<00:02:47.669> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.299> range

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
we can kind of get a sense of the range

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
we can kind of get a sense of the range
of<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:50.659> of<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:52.590> boost<00:02:52.799> function<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:53.909> well

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
of the of the boost function and as well

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.909 
of the of the boost function and as well
as<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.359> treble<00:02:54.810> control<00:02:55.169> so<00:02:55.349> right<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:55.680> I've

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
as the treble control so right now I've

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.849 
as the treble control so right now I've
got<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.310> treble<00:02:56.819> EQ<00:02:57.269> right<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> middle

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
got the treble EQ right in the middle

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.839 
got the treble EQ right in the middle
basically

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:14.080 

if<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.689> move<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.049> travel<00:03:06.469> you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:13.700> tell<00:03:13.969> it's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
if I move the travel you can tell it's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.020 
if I move the travel you can tell it's
fairly<00:03:14.540> subtle<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:16.040> will<00:03:16.219> be<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.790> ticket

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
fairly subtle it will be just the ticket

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.599 
fairly subtle it will be just the ticket
if<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.480> had<00:03:17.719> a<00:03:17.750> overly<00:03:18.500> bright<00:03:18.799> signal<00:03:19.370> that

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
if you had a overly bright signal that

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.009 
if you had a overly bright signal that
doesn't<00:03:19.909> sound<00:03:20.120> good<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.450> stage<00:03:20.719> you<00:03:20.930> could

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
doesn't sound good on stage you could

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.710 
doesn't sound good on stage you could
tame<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.439> a<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.769> bit<00:03:21.920> by<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.129> or<00:03:22.569> create<00:03:23.569> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
tame it a little bit by that or create a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.330 
tame it a little bit by that or create a
mix<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.140> cuts<00:03:24.409> through<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.010> little<00:03:25.040> bit

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
mix that cuts through just a little bit

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890 
mix that cuts through just a little bit
more<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.909> really<00:03:26.120> what<00:03:26.269> it's<00:03:26.420> designed<00:03:26.540> for

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
more and really what it's designed for

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.990 
more and really what it's designed for
is<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.379> have<00:03:27.560> two<00:03:27.769> instruments<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.790> kind

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
is if you have two instruments to kind

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.520 
is if you have two instruments to kind
of<00:03:29.060> match<00:03:29.299> their<00:03:29.599> sound<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:30.019> little<00:03:30.140> bit<00:03:30.349> more

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
of match their sound a little bit more

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.740 
of match their sound a little bit more
rather<00:03:30.769> than<00:03:30.950> really<00:03:31.639> fine-tuning<00:03:32.359> each

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
rather than really fine-tuning each

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.800 
rather than really fine-tuning each
individual<00:03:33.470> one<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.299> wanted<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.629> have<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
individual one if I wanted to have a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.030 
individual one if I wanted to have a
little<00:03:36.019> bit<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> boost<00:03:36.439> on<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.829> signal

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
little bit of a boost on this signal

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.500 
little bit of a boost on this signal
you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.540 

that<00:03:45.510> will<00:03:45.630> be<00:03:45.750> very<00:03:45.930> effective<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:47.460> a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
that will be very effective so it's a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.150 
that will be very effective so it's a
it's<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.850> great<00:03:48.090> box<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.780> redeye<00:03:49.320> twin<00:03:49.830> and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
it's a great box the redeye twin and

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.360 
it's a great box the redeye twin and
it's<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.180> sort<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.990> specialized<00:03:52.590> product<00:03:53.070> but

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
it's a sort of a specialized product but

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.440 
it's a sort of a specialized product but
if<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.610> are<00:03:53.820> mixing<00:03:54.030> two<00:03:54.420> different

if you are mixing two different

if you are mixing two different
instruments<00:03:55.290> let's<00:03:55.470> say<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.620> play<00:03:55.830> guitar
