00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:11.919
 today they take and natalia the 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.230
 professional make-up artist and today I'm 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.210
 here with soraya I'll teach you to 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 make a makeup for a concert 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.760
 with the new guano origin line 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.710
 well I'll start by applying the base 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.770
 of makeup in the case of Soraya has 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.110
 chosen a fluid base since his skin 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.070
 is young and does not have much imperfection 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.870
 what to cover 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.490
 someone is hand 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.190
 where were you going to mean the tone 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.020
 of the skin and I apply it with a brush because 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.820
 I find it easier but also 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 we can apply it with a sponge 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.690
 sea ​​and has chosen an appropriate corrector 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 to your skin tone and before applying it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.290
 I'm going to use a little bit of concealer 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.149
 to small touches on the eyelid for 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.149
 to help us fix the shadows 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.550
 I have chosen this shadow in cream with a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 Dark tone for the concert look 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.160
 more nocturnal I will apply it with a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.190
 brush and apply all over the eyelid 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.190
 mobile 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.140
 taking care not to climb too much towards 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.140
 above 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 and now with a flatter brush we are going to 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:42.569
 make a flush line of lashes in the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.569
 lower eyelashes under the eye 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 there they take 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 Well, I've chosen this shadow in 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.240
 cream because it gives a fresher look and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.610
 now the next step would be to work 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 the tab is very important for this 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.870
 look work a lot the tab above 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.060
 and below we have to give several layers of 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.060
 root to the tip 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.940
 once we have worked the mask well 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.890
 of tabs up and down we're going to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.830
 continue with the next step that we are going to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.440
 apply the concealer I always advise 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.510
 catch lighter half tone of our 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.790
 base to also give points of light and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.790
 let us serve as an illuminator 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.500
 not bad 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.260
 With the powders we are going to clarify those 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.900
 areas that need it, such as 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:05.569
 lateral of the nose 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.569
 under the eye chin front 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.640
 saving this area that always remains 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.400
 nice with a bit of brightness and for 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.840
 finalize the look we are going to use this 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 gloss power sainz 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.630
 I love makeup that teacher 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.400
 natalia because it's perfect for a 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.850
 concert but also to succeed in 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.850
 a party 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.600
 you see how simple the makeup has been 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.190
 of origin with the line of one is nothing 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.190
 now to test it at home 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.659
 a view is wrong
