00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
manage to kill him but there are several

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
manage to kill him but there are several
more<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.860> too<00:01:53.070> worried

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.760 

if<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:00.939> haven't<00:02:01.299> realized<00:02:01.570> we've<00:02:02.170> been<00:02:02.500> in<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
if you haven't realized we've been in a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.649 
if you haven't realized we've been in a
continuous<00:02:03.520> state<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.299> war<00:02:04.899> since<00:02:05.890> video<00:02:06.310> 15<00:02:07.270> I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
continuous state of war since video 15 I

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.150 
continuous state of war since video 15 I
believe<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.410> was<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:11.790> between<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.540> Japanese

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
believe it was so between the Japanese

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240 
believe it was so between the Japanese
the<00:02:15.160> South's<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:16.510> Germans<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.800> Chinese

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
the South's the Germans and the Chinese

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.890 
the South's the Germans and the Chinese
we've<00:02:19.150> been<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:19.599> war<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:21.090> more<00:02:22.090> than<00:02:22.330> half<00:02:22.569> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
we've been at war for more than half of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.080 
we've been at war for more than half of
this<00:02:23.560> less<00:02:23.739> play<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.220> far<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.940> hopefully<00:02:27.940> very

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
this less play so far but hopefully very

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.520 
this less play so far but hopefully very
soon<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:29.800> will<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:30.010> peace<00:02:31.500> which<00:02:32.500> is

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
soon we will have peace which is

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.050 
soon we will have peace which is
important<00:02:33.099> because<00:02:33.250> we'll<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.610> time<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
important because we'll have time to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.770 
important because we'll have time to
build<00:02:34.150> up<00:02:34.360> our<00:02:34.480> infrastructure<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.780> possibly

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
build up our infrastructure and possibly

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.990 
build up our infrastructure and possibly
hopefully<00:02:38.130> put<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> little<00:02:39.310> bit<00:02:39.489> more<00:02:39.549> money

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
hopefully put a little bit more money

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.270 
hopefully put a little bit more money
into<00:02:40.269> our<00:02:40.480> scientific<00:02:41.080> budget<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.040> way

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
into our scientific budget so that way

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.330 
into our scientific budget so that way
we<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.599> catch<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> some<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.040> these<00:02:45.130> other

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
we can catch up to some of these other

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.570 
we can catch up to some of these other
countries<00:02:46.980> all<00:02:47.980> right<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.130> probably<00:02:48.280> want<00:02:48.519> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
countries all right I probably want to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.630 
countries all right I probably want to
build<00:02:48.730> an<00:02:48.819> aqueduct<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.510> city<00:02:50.640> it's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
build an aqueduct in this city it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.569 
build an aqueduct in this city it's
gonna<00:02:51.790> take<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> while<00:02:53.130> city<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.280> far

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
gonna take a while city is that far

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.850 
gonna take a while city is that far
flowing<00:02:54.849> out<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.360> always<00:02:55.660> take<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> long<00:02:56.530> time

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
flowing out to always take a long time

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.840 
flowing out to always take a long time
but<00:02:58.049> that's<00:02:59.049> part<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.380> game<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.709> suppose

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.180 

all<00:03:03.850> right<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:05.970> build<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.030> marketplace<00:03:07.480> there

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
all right so build the marketplace there

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.759 
all right so build the marketplace there
see<00:03:09.190> those<00:03:09.340> two<00:03:09.519> cities<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.769> hanging

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
see those two cities right there hanging

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.940 
see those two cities right there hanging
so<00:03:12.150> tantalizingly<00:03:13.150> close<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.600> our<00:03:13.690> territory

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
so tantalizingly close to our territory

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.160 
so tantalizingly close to our territory
are<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.100> two<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.459> want<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.780> stand<00:03:17.049> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
are the two that I want and I stand a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.509 
are the two that I want and I stand a
reasonable<00:03:17.650> chance<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:18.040> taking<00:03:18.220> them<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:20.519> the

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
reasonable chance of taking them but the

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.370 
reasonable chance of taking them but the
site<00:03:21.760> send<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.180> guy<00:03:22.420> back<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:24.930> know<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.200> guy

Arabs because they're really not that
strong<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:06.099> need<00:04:06.340> them<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.970> be<00:04:07.840> strong

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139

against<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.560> Germans<00:04:09.009> and<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.790> cells

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
against the Germans and the cells

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.140 
against the Germans and the cells
I'm<00:04:11.130> not<00:04:11.280> sure<00:04:11.460> if<00:04:11.550> they're<00:04:11.670> at<00:04:11.790> war<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
I'm not sure if they're at war with the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.280 
I'm not sure if they're at war with the
Germans<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.630> they're<00:04:12.750> definitely<00:04:12.870> or

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
Germans but they're definitely or

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.400 
Germans but they're definitely or
themselves<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> stronger<00:04:15.240> they<00:04:15.450> are<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
themselves so the stronger they are the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.900 
themselves so the stronger they are the
more<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.769> hinders<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.730> opponents<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:23.040> move

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
more it hinders my opponents so move

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.970 
more it hinders my opponents so move
that<00:04:24.150> guy<00:04:24.330> up<00:04:24.540> here<00:04:24.570> like<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.380> said<00:04:25.410> probably

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
that guy up here like I said probably

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.320 
that guy up here like I said probably
won't<00:04:26.190> get<00:04:26.280> there<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.580> time<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.120> at<00:04:27.210> least

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
won't get there in time but at least

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.500 
won't get there in time but at least
it's<00:04:27.600> something<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.550> never<00:04:29.730> know<00:04:29.970> when<00:04:30.210> war

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
it's something you never know when war

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.660 
it's something you never know when war
might<00:04:30.720> break<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.320> again<00:04:31.680> for<00:04:32.340> no<00:04:32.490> reason<00:04:34.670> all
