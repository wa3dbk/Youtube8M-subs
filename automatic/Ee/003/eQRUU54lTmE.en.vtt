00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.130 
then we would have this variation check
King<00:01:29.909> goes<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:31.290> took<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.799> example<00:01:33.140> night

to d4 and let's say King goes to day two

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.039 
to d4 and let's say King goes to day two
