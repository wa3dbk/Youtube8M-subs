 fetal size metal cover 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.820
 rear camera 0 1 megapixels like

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.870
 charged for fully charged nothing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.850
 just a light bulb usb cable does not occur 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:38.830
 for charging and data transfer in the phone 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.410
 not in the standard headphone jack 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.100
 so they made this 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.100
 transition 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.340

 pubs so I tested it for a day 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:22.150
 noticed for average sociable people 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.720
 for example, like me, for example, it was enough for me 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.190
 on 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.600
 whole working day talking on it 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.210
 about three hours and 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.280
 in general, he died like that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.680
 just call 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.900
 periodically 23 will be enough for me 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.560
 charging which is quite normal so on 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.560

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.530
 such a menu here 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.170
 so well in general, everything is clear 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:20.170
 the most important thing about it is probably such 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.200
 the type and size that is what attracted me 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.250
