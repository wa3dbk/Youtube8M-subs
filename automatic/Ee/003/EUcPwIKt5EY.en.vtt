00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.420
 In addition to the closed school, I line a little graphic card 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.790
 ing 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.700
 over jas 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.299
 Women's Day I want to explain 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.919
 It is a graphic card 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.919
 interfacebuilder falls apart now 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.410
 The interface with farc is 8 strikeouts 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.349
 is not it 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 The mouth is similar if it is a personal computer 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.150
 A little old 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.439
 If you are worried 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.640
 afp current affairs 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.399
 If the US soldier becomes a slightly old model, the game or that 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.440
 A few years ago 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.100
 It is a raw development process 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.890
 It will be, but it is called 4 bodies here 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.180
 Best 1 match 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.720
 scs doctor meeting passed 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.730
 It is interesting because it is a graphic card 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.370
 I want to attach it to my desktop 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.530
 Interface 4 baht 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 See also the manual 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 Expand 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.560
 Is it a la pci-express? 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.060
 Is it gpp 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.140
 Or one match 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.570
 be careful 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 I hope you get this 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.729
 It seems like at here Here the deficit is 5200 people 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.490
 It becomes fx 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 In this space saving improvement 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.120
 Good type graphic card 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.550
 Will be 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.410
 USA 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.830
 Mr. Tsushima is here 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.610
 It is 9200 resolution, but it is space saving 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.300
 Support for low profile 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.960
 Although it is a ban and it is somewhat good when purchasing ecd 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 If you are a space saving model 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.729
 It is Torishima Run Low profile correspondence 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.900
 I think that it is good to make it this graphic card 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 pci-express11 games 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.020
 I think there are models for each low profile 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 Those 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.990
 It is eco big 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.360
 It is graphic card form 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.540
 I will take the area 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.550
 26 updated 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.450
 Or gtx 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.679
 2228 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 Or 28 minutes 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.849
 Law 4 has the same profile 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.889
 It is the third place in all six times 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.100
 Because I will do my best with you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.549
 Yeah on the bench 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.459
 Bench or 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.799
 On the bench 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.549
 It's a low-profile one 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.549
 As it is adapter, it is type to be attached to there 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.549
 Here 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.899
 It is a d-sub tower, but there are 5 self-made 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.109
 If you are 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.730
 There are many more one 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.299
 4. For those of you 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.759
 It is kaists 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.839
 In the form of snow 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.000
 Said what the model played in was 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I would like to see updated 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.949
 ia This is better, so you can get dollar yen in space saving 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.939
 Be a man 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.649
 I have not 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.349
 There is no north, but I ask for your understanding 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.829
 This is true 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.659
 The expansion card is 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.969
 Attach 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.059
 It is a place now 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.479
 In the case of that novel 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 Because the end is not written 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.399
 Not low profile 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.099
 The person who says that it costs 10,000 yen for the card 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.389
 is 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.389
 Is wide 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.109
 Plug into a place like this 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.369
 Though 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.169
 I will fight back 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.949
 There are no two or ninety nine 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.979
 So it is not the same gymnasium from here 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.139
 In case of space saving type 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.609
 Because you will not be able to install that 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.209
 Always save space 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.579
 66 for horses 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.909
 If you do not understand well, it is low profile compatible 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.120
 Department store available 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.909
 The desktop too 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.909
 Because you can attach the force 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.360
 If you do not know the shape of ELPC, use 66 cells. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360
 I think high efficiency looks cool 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.680
 It is a milestone of the expansion pack one after another in an easy way 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.309
 Those 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.949
 It may be a little while I'm carrying a PC 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.849
 I can not accept it, but I'm looking forward to it. 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.210
 What is received is micro atx- 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.009
 It's a motherboard, and the station at atx normal Ishihara a little more 7 days complaints 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.430
 I think there is a path 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.180
 There is a cpu in the middle of the race, but it is the foot reason 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.839
 Directly below the processor 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:04.469
 Here is the effect graphic of the part 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.599
 I will put out 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.210
 Well, what I've seen so far is the pgp bus 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.779
 Yeah 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.170
 Make use of this white 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.720
 I will extend it 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.939
 slot 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.610
 It will be secretly showing each other in the lawmaker model 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.419
 I think that there is something called Isaacs when it comes to 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.419
 Even though aithebath compatible graphics cards are 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.279
 I would like to consult 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:33.289
 Here is a graphic card jpc cup 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.050
 It is a normal pci 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.930
 Dialect cart for the extension bus 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.979
 Such a model 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.419
 I'm in the US tv, but I will attach high 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.150
 It is strong but I want to have you come around here 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.459
 Told
