although<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.889> Jonathan<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.460> Aramis

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
although this is Jonathan with Aramis

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.030 
although this is Jonathan with Aramis
I've<00:00:12.780> had<00:00:12.900> some<00:00:13.080> questions<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.620> how<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I've had some questions about how to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060 
I've had some questions about how to
clean<00:00:14.520> our<00:00:14.910> diffuser<00:00:15.920> there's<00:00:16.920> been

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
clean our diffuser there's been

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.940 
clean our diffuser there's been
situations<00:00:17.279> where<00:00:18.290> people<00:00:19.290> have<00:00:19.439> called<00:00:19.770> back

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
situations where people have called back

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.350 
situations where people have called back
and<00:00:20.130> said<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> unit<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.970> no<00:00:21.180> longer

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
and said that the unit is no longer

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.580 
and said that the unit is no longer
working<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.040> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.640> with

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
working and it has a lot to do with

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.260 
working and it has a lot to do with
there<00:00:25.590> being<00:00:25.770> no<00:00:26.040> vapor<00:00:26.369> that's<00:00:26.759> coming<00:00:27.149> out

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
there being no vapor that's coming out

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.569 
there being no vapor that's coming out
of<00:00:27.509> the<00:00:27.779> unit<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.200> I'd<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> show<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
of the unit and I'd like to show you

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.940 
of the unit and I'd like to show you
that<00:00:30.180> in<00:00:30.419> most<00:00:30.779> cases<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.470> reason<00:00:31.739> why

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
that in most cases the reason why

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.860 
that in most cases the reason why
there's<00:00:32.160> no<00:00:32.430> vapor<00:00:33.149> coming<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> unit

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
there's no vapor coming out of the unit

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
there's no vapor coming out of the unit
is<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.070> small<00:00:35.340> tube<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.640> actually

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is because the small tube that actually

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
is because the small tube that actually
draws<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.570> oil<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> oil

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
draws the oil up out of the oil

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.110 
draws the oil up out of the oil
reservoir<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:40.400> brings<00:00:41.400> it<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.700> top<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
reservoir and brings it to the top of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
reservoir and brings it to the top of
the<00:00:42.180> tube<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.720> get<00:00:42.840> blasted<00:00:43.080> with<00:00:43.380> air

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the tube so we can get blasted with air

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
the tube so we can get blasted with air
can<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.520> clogged<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.240> either<00:00:45.440> something

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
can get clogged with either something

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
can get clogged with either something
that<00:00:46.560> fell<00:00:46.740> in<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.150> clogged<00:00:48.420> with

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that fell in you can get clogged with

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.870 
that fell in you can get clogged with
heart<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.560> oil<00:00:49.860> especially<00:00:50.490> if<00:00:50.580> it<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:50.790> has

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
heart and oil especially if it well has

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.580 
heart and oil especially if it well has
been<00:00:51.030> left<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.080> unit<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.470> too

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
been left into the in the unit for too

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.400 
been left into the in the unit for too
long<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:54.450> can<00:00:54.570> also<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.460> caused<00:00:56.460> by<00:00:57.410> carrier

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
long it can also be caused by carrier

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.600 
long it can also be caused by carrier
oils<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.450> in<00:01:01.220> the<00:01:02.220> essential

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
oils that in the in the in the essential

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.390 
oils that in the in the in the essential
oil<00:01:02.790> but<00:01:02.970> you<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:04.040> someone<00:01:05.040> didn't<00:01:05.280> know

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
oil but you know someone didn't know

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.819 
oil but you know someone didn't know
what<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.380> not

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
what there was in it or was just not

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.740 
what there was in it or was just not
sure<00:01:08.009> how<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> how<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> unit<00:01:09.030> anyway

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
sure how to how to use the unit anyway

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.410 
sure how to how to use the unit anyway
so<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.220> best<00:01:11.369> way<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.579> clean<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> unit<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so the the best way to clean the unit is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.640 
so the the best way to clean the unit is
with<00:01:12.630> rubbing<00:01:12.930> alcohol<00:01:13.100> that's<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:15.090> stuff

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
with rubbing alcohol that's this stuff

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
with rubbing alcohol that's this stuff
91%<00:01:16.650> isopropyl<00:01:17.040> alcohol<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.090> mean<00:01:18.630> alcohol

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
91% isopropyl alcohol I mean alcohol

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
91% isopropyl alcohol I mean alcohol
will<00:01:19.170> basically<00:01:21.560> dissolve<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> oil<00:01:22.770> that's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
will basically dissolve the oil that's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020 
will basically dissolve the oil that's
inside<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> unit<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.700> most<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> times

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
inside the unit and most of the times

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.820 
inside the unit and most of the times
when<00:01:27.180> there's<00:01:27.360> clogs<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> clogs<00:01:28.260> will<00:01:28.530> occur

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
when there's clogs the clogs will occur

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.100 
when there's clogs the clogs will occur
inside<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.090> middle<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.600> top<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
inside the middle or the top of the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
inside the middle or the top of the
filament<00:01:31.440> because<00:01:32.340> there'll<00:01:32.580> be<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:33.229> larger

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
filament because there'll be a larger

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
filament because there'll be a larger
mass<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> bottom<00:01:35.400> they<00:01:35.580> actually<00:01:35.970> gets

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mass at the bottom they actually gets

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960 
mass at the bottom they actually gets
pushed<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> top<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.920> blocks<00:01:38.190> an

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pushed up into the top and blocks an

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
pushed up into the top and blocks an
artery<00:01:39.260> anyway<00:01:40.260> so<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.830> way<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.310> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
artery anyway so the way the way to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.590 
artery anyway so the way the way to
clean<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> unit<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.299> actually

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
clean out the unit is actually

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
clean out the unit is actually
relatively<00:01:42.869> simple<00:01:44.690> if<00:01:45.690> we<00:01:45.750> removed<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> top

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
relatively simple if we removed the top

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
relatively simple if we removed the top
I<00:01:47.220> almost<00:01:48.030> always<00:01:48.240> say<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> remove<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> glass

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I almost always say to remove the glass

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.960 
I almost always say to remove the glass
parts<00:01:49.860> first<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:52.610> top<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
parts first the top and I can get it to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.560 
parts first the top and I can get it to
focus<00:01:57.590> show<00:01:58.590> you<00:02:00.950> what<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.040> looks<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.570> inside

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
focus show you what it looks like inside

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.310 
focus show you what it looks like inside
the<00:02:03.810> unit<00:02:04.670> there<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.270> unit<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.990> no

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the unit there in this unit there is no

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.440 
the unit there in this unit there is no
clog<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.099> unit<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.610> when<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.269> is<00:02:09.299> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
clog in the unit but when there is a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.039 
clog in the unit but when there is a
clod<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.649> happen<00:02:10.799> on<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:12.569> side<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
clod it will happen on this side because

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.879 
clod it will happen on this side because
this<00:02:13.620> bottle<00:02:14.400> excuse<00:02:15.090> me<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.360> tube<00:02:15.889> is

this<00:02:18.959> glass<00:02:19.139> it<00:02:19.590> floats<00:02:19.919> in<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.189> oil<00:02:20.400> well<00:02:21.329> it

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
this glass it floats in the oil well it

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.160 
this glass it floats in the oil well it
gets<00:02:21.480> pulled<00:02:21.840> up

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
gets pulled up

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
gets pulled up
and<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.310> where<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.490> clogs<00:02:23.760> occurs<00:02:24.150> right

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and this is where the clogs occurs right

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
and this is where the clogs occurs right
around<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> goal<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.040> basically

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
around here so the goal is to basically

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.449 
around here so the goal is to basically
clean<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> clog<00:02:27.209> out<00:02:27.560> from<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.800> from<00:02:29.310> this

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
clean the clog out from this from this

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.910 
clean the clog out from this from this
area<00:02:29.819> right<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.200> best<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.709> do

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
area right here and the best way to do

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.250 
area right here and the best way to do
it<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.550> simplest<00:02:32.910> way<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it and the simplest way to do it is to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
it and the simplest way to do it is to
soak<00:02:34.560> your<00:02:34.740> bottle<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:37.080> alcohol<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.790> process

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
soak your bottle in alcohol that process

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.190 
soak your bottle in alcohol that process
is<00:02:39.420> relatively<00:02:39.750> simple<00:02:40.790> take<00:02:41.790> your<00:02:41.940> bottle<00:02:42.240> or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
is relatively simple take your bottle or

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.170 
is relatively simple take your bottle or
take<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> cup<00:02:47.000> place<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:50.070> bottle<00:02:50.370> inside<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
take a cup place the bottle inside the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.610 
take a cup place the bottle inside the
tub<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:53.880> take<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.239> alcohol<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.320> pour

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
tub and then take some alcohol and pour

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.060 
tub and then take some alcohol and pour
it<00:02:55.709> inside<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:58.440> can<00:03:00.410> inside<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.590> bottle<00:03:01.890> so

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
it inside you can inside the bottle so

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.310 
it inside you can inside the bottle so
that<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.489> completely<00:03:02.850> flows<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:03.360> there's<00:03:04.170> no

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
that it completely flows up there's no

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.509 
that it completely flows up there's no
need<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.800> too<00:03:05.040> careful<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.080> outside

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
need to be too careful with the outside

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.650 
need to be too careful with the outside
you<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.700> swirl<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.120> around<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.450> little<00:03:09.540> bit

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
you can swirl it around a little bit

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.509 
you can swirl it around a little bit
you'll<00:03:09.930> notice<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.470> there's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.370> bit

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
you'll notice that there's a little bit

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.210 
you'll notice that there's a little bit
dribbling<00:03:12.030> out<00:03:12.150> because<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.019> alcohol<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.130> not

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
dribbling out because the alcohol is not

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460 
dribbling out because the alcohol is not
dribbling<00:03:14.640> down<00:03:14.850> through<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> air<00:03:15.630> intake

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
dribbling down through the air intake

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.940 
dribbling down through the air intake
tube<00:03:17.310> which<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> vent<00:03:18.030> tube

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
tube which is the vent tube

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.050 
tube which is the vent tube
what<00:03:19.950> will<00:03:20.040> happen<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.730> once<00:03:20.910> you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
what will happen is is that once you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.530 
what will happen is is that once you
leave<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.420> there<00:03:23.120> there's<00:03:24.120> going<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
leave it there there's going to be a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.160 
leave it there there's going to be a
little<00:03:24.810> bubble<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.400> occurs<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.750> bottom

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
little bubble that occurs in the bottom

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.250 
little bubble that occurs in the bottom
of<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.610> small<00:03:29.910> tube<00:03:30.120> Amazo<00:03:30.690> min<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.079> can

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
of the small tube Amazo min so you can

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.759 
of the small tube Amazo min so you can
see<00:03:31.470> what<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.709> looks<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:36.709> there's<00:03:37.709> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
see what this looks like so there's a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.940 
see what this looks like so there's a
bubble<00:03:38.070> inside<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.910> left<00:03:39.150> tube<00:03:39.739> above<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
bubble inside of the left tube above the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.979 
bubble inside of the left tube above the
bubble<00:03:41.310> there's<00:03:41.880> alcohol<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.540> has<00:03:42.690> filled

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
bubble there's alcohol that has filled

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.190 
bubble there's alcohol that has filled
that<00:03:43.140> tube<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.970> means<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.019> most

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
that tube up that means that in the most

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.370 
that tube up that means that in the most
important<00:03:46.680> part<00:03:46.829> where<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> clogs<00:03:47.370> occur

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
important part where the clogs occur

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.050 
important part where the clogs occur
alcohol<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.530> now<00:03:49.709> dissolving<00:03:50.340> any<00:03:50.519> oil<00:03:50.790> that's

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
alcohol is now dissolving any oil that's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.810 
alcohol is now dissolving any oil that's
inside<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.630> there<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.590> nasty<00:03:52.829> clogs

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
inside of there for really nasty clogs

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.530 
inside of there for really nasty clogs
you<00:03:54.540> may<00:03:54.950> soak<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.820> 12<00:03:57.390> hours

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
you may soak this for up to 12 hours

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.960 
you may soak this for up to 12 hours
leaving<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.200> overnight<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:59.280> notice<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
leaving it overnight you notice that the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.670 
leaving it overnight you notice that the
alcohol<00:04:00.780> will<00:04:00.959> start<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.260> dribble<00:04:01.470> out

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
alcohol will start to dribble out

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
alcohol will start to dribble out
through<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> tube<00:04:02.579> down<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.180> here<00:04:03.360> but<00:04:03.570> it'll

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
through the tube down to here but it'll

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.569 
through the tube down to here but it'll
stop<00:04:04.049> once<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.470> hits<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.769> top<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.250> tube<00:04:05.430> in

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
stop once it hits the top of the tube in

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.050 
stop once it hits the top of the tube in
trouble<00:04:06.000> any<00:04:06.090> lower<00:04:06.299> than<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> once<00:04:08.850> it's

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
trouble any lower than that so once it's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.080 
trouble any lower than that so once it's
all<00:04:09.239> done<00:04:10.130> you've<00:04:11.130> soaked<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> couple

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
all done you've soaked it for a couple

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.900 
all done you've soaked it for a couple
of<00:04:12.299> hours<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:13.500> usually<00:04:14.040> get<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.370> whole<00:04:14.549> bottle

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.420 
cleans up really really nicely just like
was<00:04:35.360> when<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.750> first<00:04:35.960> bought<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:36.289> it's<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.280> nice

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
was when you first bought it it's a nice

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.040 
was when you first bought it it's a nice
thing<00:04:37.639> about<00:04:37.669> having<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.240> glass<00:04:40.539> unit<00:04:41.539> nothing

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
thing about having a glass unit nothing

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.330 
thing about having a glass unit nothing
made<00:04:42.169> out<00:04:42.289> of<00:04:42.380> plastic<00:04:42.889> you'll<00:04:43.069> notice

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
made out of plastic you'll notice

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.270 
made out of plastic you'll notice
something<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.910> is<00:04:44.470> all<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.560> fingerprints<00:04:46.039> are

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
something it is all the fingerprints are

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.710 
something it is all the fingerprints are
gone<00:04:46.430> all<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.789> oil<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.210> gone

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
gone all the oil is gone

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.650 
gone all the oil is gone
it<00:04:48.080> comes<00:04:48.259> off<00:04:48.470> almost<00:04:48.680> immediately<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:50.240> once

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
it comes off almost immediately so once

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.939 
it comes off almost immediately so once
it's<00:04:50.810> done<00:04:50.900> you'll<00:04:51.229> be<00:04:51.349> left<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:51.620> sort<00:04:51.889> of

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
it's done you'll be left with sort of

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.879 
it's done you'll be left with sort of
like<00:04:52.069> a<00:04:52.099> glass<00:04:53.500> alcohol<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.650> can<00:04:54.770> actually

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
like a glass alcohol you can actually

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.909 
like a glass alcohol you can actually
reuse<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.699> alcohol<00:04:56.120> if<00:04:56.240> you'd<00:04:56.389> like<00:04:56.710> as<00:04:57.710> long

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
reuse that alcohol if you'd like as long

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.339 
reuse that alcohol if you'd like as long
as<00:04:58.039> there's<00:04:58.190> no<00:04:58.340> major<00:04:58.639> chunks<00:04:59.240> the<00:05:00.229> other

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
as there's no major chunks the other

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.749 
as there's no major chunks the other
great<00:05:00.560> thing<00:05:00.710> about<00:05:00.740> using<00:05:01.039> alcohol<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:02.750> that

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
great thing about using alcohol is that

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.700 
great thing about using alcohol is that
with<00:05:04.759> just<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.060> couple<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.479> seconds<00:05:05.930> almost<00:05:06.530> all

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
with just a couple of seconds almost all

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.870 
with just a couple of seconds almost all
of<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.949> alcohol<00:05:07.099> will<00:05:07.550> evaporate<00:05:09.460> clean<00:05:10.460> and

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
of the alcohol will evaporate clean and

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.560 
of the alcohol will evaporate clean and
beautiful<00:05:12.910> just<00:05:13.910> some<00:05:14.030> of<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.150> areas<00:05:14.270> where

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
beautiful just some of the areas where

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.339 
beautiful just some of the areas where
there's<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.840> little<00:05:15.020> bit<00:05:15.139> of<00:05:15.199> residual<00:05:17.259> have<00:05:18.259> to

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
there's a little bit of residual have to

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:30.290 
there's a little bit of residual have to
share<00:05:18.560> one<00:05:18.680> looks<00:05:18.860> like<00:05:18.919> a<00:05:19.130> cheap

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.469 

ends<00:05:31.300> up<00:05:31.360> looking<00:05:31.630> really<00:05:31.750> nice<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:33.479> eating

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
ends up looking really nice and eating

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.060 
ends up looking really nice and eating
to<00:05:34.540> make<00:05:34.660> sure<00:05:34.780> those<00:05:34.960> tea<00:05:35.169> tubes<00:05:35.440> may<00:05:35.680> remain

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
to make sure those tea tubes may remain

to make sure those tea tubes may remain
maintained<00:05:37.530> another<00:05:38.530> thing<00:05:38.770> that's

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
maintained another thing that's

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.010 
maintained another thing that's
important<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.580> do<00:05:39.669> to<00:05:39.789> keep<00:05:40.000> what<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.750> can<00:05:40.900> do

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
important to do to keep what you can do

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.029 
important to do to keep what you can do
to<00:05:41.110> sort<00:05:41.259> of<00:05:41.289> avoid<00:05:41.650> there<00:05:41.860> being<00:05:42.039> problems

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
to sort of avoid there being problems

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.680 
to sort of avoid there being problems
probably<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.220> most<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:46.090> easiest<00:05:46.449> way<00:05:46.630> to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
probably the most the easiest way to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.159 
probably the most the easiest way to
avoid<00:05:46.960> problems<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:48.270> getting<00:05:49.270> clogs<00:05:49.690> is

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
avoid problems with getting clogs is

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.020 
avoid problems with getting clogs is
making<00:05:50.650> sure<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.039> use<00:05:51.070> up<00:05:51.490> all<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.669> oil

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
making sure that you use up all the oil

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.960 
making sure that you use up all the oil
before<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.169> turn<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.500> unit<00:05:53.770> off<00:05:53.889> you<00:05:54.850> don't

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
before you turn the unit off you don't

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.760 
before you turn the unit off you don't
use<00:05:55.150> up<00:05:55.180> all<00:05:55.389> the<00:05:55.419> oil<00:05:55.539> as<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.199> has<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.470> high

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
use up all the oil as it has a high

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.279 
use up all the oil as it has a high
chance<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:57.310> oxidizing<00:05:58.000> if<00:05:58.780> it's<00:06:00.270> it's<00:06:01.270> if<00:06:02.139> it's

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
chance of oxidizing if it's it's if it's

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.500 
chance of oxidizing if it's it's if it's
very<00:06:02.560> stable<00:06:02.800> oil<00:06:03.130> you<00:06:03.669> want<00:06:03.789> oxidized<00:06:04.300> with

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
very stable oil you want oxidized with

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.230 
very stable oil you want oxidized with
some<00:06:04.720> forms<00:06:05.020> of<00:06:05.110> oil<00:06:05.350> will<00:06:05.500> oxidize

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
some forms of oil will oxidize

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.460 
some forms of oil will oxidize
specifically<00:06:07.240> oils<00:06:07.630> that<00:06:07.780> come<00:06:07.960> from<00:06:08.139> trees

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
specifically oils that come from trees

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.840 
specifically oils that come from trees
they<00:06:08.740> tend<00:06:08.949> to<00:06:09.010> oxidize<00:06:09.160> a<00:06:09.490> little<00:06:09.729> more

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
they tend to oxidize a little more

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.460 
they tend to oxidize a little more
easily<00:06:11.490> I<00:06:12.510> think<00:06:13.510> that's<00:06:13.810> about<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.229> so<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.410> just

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
easily I think that's about it so I just

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.560 
easily I think that's about it so I just
keep<00:06:14.800> trying<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.220> keep<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.430> unit<00:06:15.699> clean<00:06:16.120> and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
keep trying to keep the unit clean and

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.939 
keep trying to keep the unit clean and
don't<00:06:16.840> leave<00:06:17.020> if<00:06:17.199> you're<00:06:17.320> gonna<00:06:17.440> if<00:06:17.710> you<00:06:17.800> know

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
don't leave if you're gonna if you know

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.040 
don't leave if you're gonna if you know
you're<00:06:18.100> gonna<00:06:18.389> leave<00:06:19.389> for<00:06:19.600> a<00:06:19.660> while<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:19.930> not

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
you're gonna leave for a while and not

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.300 
you're gonna leave for a while and not
use<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.440> inter<00:06:20.560> for<00:06:20.740> several<00:06:21.010> days<00:06:21.130> and

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
use the inter for several days and

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.310 
use the inter for several days and
there's<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:21.490> little<00:06:21.669> bit<00:06:21.760> of<00:06:21.820> extra<00:06:22.060> oil<00:06:22.320> you

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
there's a little bit of extra oil you

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.960 
there's a little bit of extra oil you
dump<00:06:23.620> it<00:06:23.710> out<00:06:23.830> or<00:06:24.400> put<00:06:25.030> it<00:06:25.120> into<00:06:25.389> a<00:06:25.419> new<00:06:26.020> bottle

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
dump it out or put it into a new bottle

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.339 
dump it out or put it into a new bottle
like<00:06:27.970> an<00:06:28.090> essential<00:06:28.509> oil<00:06:28.630> bottle<00:06:29.080> if<00:06:29.169> you<00:06:29.259> have

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
like an essential oil bottle if you have

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.120 
like an essential oil bottle if you have
an<00:06:29.470> old<00:06:30.389> old<00:06:31.389> bottle<00:06:31.840> that's<00:06:31.990> empty<00:06:32.440> it's<00:06:32.889> just

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
an old old bottle that's empty it's just

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.779 
an old old bottle that's empty it's just
lying<00:06:33.340> around

lying around

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.180 
lying around
you<00:06:34.210> can<00:06:34.360> actually<00:06:34.479> have<00:06:34.780> oil<00:06:35.740> that<00:06:35.889> you<00:06:36.010> put

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
you can actually have oil that you put

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.939 
you can actually have oil that you put
back<00:06:36.400> into<00:06:36.699> the<00:06:36.910> old<00:06:37.120> bottle<00:06:40.740> anyway
