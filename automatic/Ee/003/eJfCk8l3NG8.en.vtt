in this instructional video I will be

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.949 
in this instructional video I will be
teaching<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.060> throw<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> baseball<00:00:03.480> or

pointers along the way this video will
showcase<00:00:08.429> both<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> left-handed<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
showcase both the left-handed and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.629 
showcase both the left-handed and
right-handed<00:00:09.900> thrower<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:11.130> filmed<00:00:11.490> from

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
right-handed thrower and is filmed from

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.180 
right-handed thrower and is filmed from
multiple<00:00:12.059> angles<00:00:12.320> let's<00:00:13.320> get<00:00:13.500> started<00:00:13.950> with

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
multiple angles let's get started with

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.000 
multiple angles let's get started with
the<00:00:14.309> right-handed<00:00:14.490> thrower<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:16.680> throw<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the right-handed thrower to throw the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.240 
the right-handed thrower to throw the
ball<00:00:17.190> correctly<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.820> will<00:00:18.029> start<00:00:18.359> using<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
ball correctly we will start using the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.650 
ball correctly we will start using the
SST<00:00:20.250> method<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.760> throwing<00:00:21.150> which<00:00:21.390> means

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
SST method of throwing which means

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.740 
SST method of throwing which means
sideways<00:00:22.410> shift<00:00:23.010> swing<00:00:23.730> step<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> throw

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
sideways shift swing step and throw

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.089 
sideways shift swing step and throw
notice<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.900> our<00:00:27.930> right-handed<00:00:28.439> thrower<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
notice that our right-handed thrower is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
notice that our right-handed thrower is
starting<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.609> sideways<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.269> his<00:00:30.390> target

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
starting out sideways to his target

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
starting out sideways to his target
getting<00:00:31.439> sideways<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.070> target<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
getting sideways to the target is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
getting sideways to the target is
critically<00:00:33.059> important<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.050> enables

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
critically important because it enables

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
critically important because it enables
you<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.590> throw<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.040> your<00:00:35.219> entire<00:00:35.489> body<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you to throw with your entire body and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.910 
you to throw with your entire body and
not<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.690> own<00:00:36.840> control<00:00:37.230> ball<00:00:37.469> much

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
not just your own control ball much

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.290 
not just your own control ball much
harder<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> throw<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.030> entire

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
harder if you throw with your entire

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.420 
harder if you throw with your entire
body<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.770> arm

now on to the second s of the metaphor
shipped<00:00:46.670> before<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.840> forward<00:00:48.320> toward<00:00:48.590> the

shipped before going forward toward the
target<00:00:48.890> you<00:00:49.310> must<00:00:49.520> first<00:00:49.760> shift<00:00:50.150> your<00:00:50.300> weight

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
target you must first shift your weight

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.600 
target you must first shift your weight
onto<00:00:50.720> your<00:00:50.990> back<00:00:51.200> or<00:00:51.500> pitching<00:00:51.710> arm<00:00:52.040> side<00:00:52.280> foot

onto your back or pitching arm side foot

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.760 
onto your back or pitching arm side foot
doing<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:53.630> will<00:00:53.930> create<00:00:54.080> linear<00:00:54.590> momentum

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
doing this will create linear momentum

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.740 
doing this will create linear momentum
that<00:00:55.310> will<00:00:55.430> be<00:00:55.520> converted<00:00:56.000> into<00:00:56.120> rotational

that will be converted into rotational

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.510 
that will be converted into rotational
momentum<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.350> help<00:00:57.560> pull<00:00:57.950> your<00:00:58.130> shoulders

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
momentum and help pull your shoulders

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.180 
beginning of this clip how the thrower
first<00:01:01.910> lean<00:01:02.239> back<00:01:02.540> into<00:01:02.840> his<00:01:03.050> motion<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.620> took

first lean back into his motion and took

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.130 
first lean back into his motion and took
the<00:01:04.309> step<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.970> helped<00:01:05.300> him<00:01:05.510> propelled

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
the step that helped him propelled

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.820 
the step that helped him propelled
towards<00:01:06.680> his<00:01:06.800> target

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
arms down out and up notice how his arm

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.140 
arms down out and up notice how his arm
swings<00:01:21.620> as<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.100> throws<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.460> ball<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:22.910> this

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
swings as you throws the ball and this

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.700 
swings as you throws the ball and this
other<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:23.560> continue<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.590> rotate

the<00:01:28.640> last<00:01:28.880> s<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.390> metaphor<00:01:29.780> step<00:01:30.320> is

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
the last s of the metaphor step is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.980 
the last s of the metaphor step is
pretty<00:01:31.070> straightforward<00:01:31.930> after<00:01:32.930> you

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
pretty straightforward after you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.300 
pretty straightforward after you
throwing<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.409> ball<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.920> should<00:01:34.100> step

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
throwing the ball you should step

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.340 
throwing the ball you should step
directly<00:01:34.490> towards<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> target<00:01:35.540> with<00:01:36.140> your

directly towards the target with your

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.290 
directly towards the target with your
shoulder<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:36.979> throwing<00:01:37.490> arm<00:01:37.640> pointed<00:01:38.210> at

shoulder of the throwing arm pointed at
the<00:01:38.360> target<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.810> follow<00:01:39.170> through<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.770> now

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the target and follow through and now

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.770 
the target and follow through and now
