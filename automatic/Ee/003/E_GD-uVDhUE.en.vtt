 wisconsin two hours away from 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.719
 cities of chicago and this is one of these 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.960
 good ideas how to spend a weekend away 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.699
 from the city of chicago i mean if you have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.140
 trip 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 unless of course you live somewhere near 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 this city is milwaukee because the city 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 really interesting here is what 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 look and if so go back to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.020
 stories pride it was originally a beer 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.720
 the city and today at least it's already quite 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 the other is not like the old days 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.430
 milwaukee it's still filled with different 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 commodity bars dads and here is very 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.460
 many little twaros and the biggest 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 among them is miller brewery companies 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.600
 brewery company miller course and through 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.490
 straight ahead is another 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.490
 interesting museum harley-davidson 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.580

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.820
 take a walk look at the views of the city and in 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.980
 milwaukee has its own rivers camp it but 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.040
 one of the most interesting ones 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.550
 objects for me was still art museum of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.720
 my loki who is right behind me 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.310
 The architect of this museum is 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.950
 santiago calatrava this lubricant 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.630
 I already know his name 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.160
 many years ago and I dreamed about 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.080

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.880

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.540
 always senior how are you doing principle like 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.640
 in many cities of america speaking 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 about where to stay in the city again 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.090
 same basis with your subjective opinion 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.100
 you will probably advise brew house 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 this is a hotel that was built on 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.920
 based on the old brewery which 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.470
 no longer functioning bobst factories we 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.970
 filmed so many videos so 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.130
 we are likely divided them into several 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.660
 parts so that you feel comfortable with them 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.910
