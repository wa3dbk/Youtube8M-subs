it preferably your your note nose

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.080 
it preferably your your note nose
because<00:05:21.630> well<00:05:22.110> that's<00:05:22.440> almost<00:05:23.310> like<00:05:23.460> a<00:05:23.610> where

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
because well that's almost like a where

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.140 
because well that's almost like a where
you're<00:05:24.210> gonna<00:05:24.389> put<00:05:24.630> it<00:05:24.780> cuz<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.889> can<00:05:26.150> probably

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
you're gonna put it cuz you can probably

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.270 
you're gonna put it cuz you can probably
fit<00:05:27.509> a<00:05:28.340> pencil<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.550> your<00:05:29.610> nose<00:05:30.289> but<00:05:31.289> that's

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
fit a pencil in your nose but that's

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.029 
fit a pencil in your nose but that's
unlikely<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.750> someone<00:05:34.080> would<00:05:34.320> actually<00:05:34.409> try

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
unlikely that someone would actually try

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.740 
unlikely that someone would actually try
to<00:05:35.099> do<00:05:35.400> that<00:05:35.610> unless<00:05:36.150> they're<00:05:36.419> committed

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
to do that unless they're committed

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.029 
to do that unless they're committed
