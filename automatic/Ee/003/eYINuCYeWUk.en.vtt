the first question from Martin the first

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.970 
the first question from Martin the first
question<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> from<00:00:15.109> Andrew<00:00:16.109> cook<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.859> is

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
question is from Andrew cook and it is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.740 
question is from Andrew cook and it is
how<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.460> bleed<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.940> cooling<00:00:18.330> system

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
how do I bleed my cooling system

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.840 
how do I bleed my cooling system
properly<00:00:19.340> we've<00:00:20.340> done<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> few<00:00:20.699> times

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
properly we've done that a few times

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.220 
properly we've done that a few times
about<00:00:21.150> 11<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.840> probably<00:00:22.020> haven't

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
about 11 we but we probably haven't

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.960 
about 11 we but we probably haven't
gotten<00:00:22.470> into<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> lot<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.859> detail<00:00:23.369> that's<00:00:23.789> right

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
gotten into a lot of detail that's right

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.250 
gotten into a lot of detail that's right
what<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> pretty<00:00:24.779> much<00:00:24.990> every

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
what you have to do it pretty much every

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.890 
what you have to do it pretty much every
time<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.740> open<00:00:26.070> something<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> involves<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
time you open something that involves a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.000 
time you open something that involves a
cooling<00:00:28.140> system<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.830> that's

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
cooling system have to do it so that's

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
cooling system have to do it so that's
changing<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.429> turbo<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:29.910> radiator<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.570> an

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
changing in turbo or radiator or an

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.650 
changing in turbo or radiator or an
engine<00:00:31.470> swap<00:00:31.640> and<00:00:32.640> yeah<00:00:32.940> basically<00:00:33.210> by

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
engine swap and yeah basically by

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
engine swap and yeah basically by
bleeding<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> blow<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> air<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.710> so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
bleeding you want to blow the air out so

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.410 
bleeding you want to blow the air out so
something<00:00:35.610> water<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.180> water

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
something water in there because water

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
something water in there because water
the<00:00:36.600> air<00:00:36.809> doesn't<00:00:37.110> call<00:00:37.320> your<00:00:37.469> engine<00:00:37.680> only

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the air doesn't call your engine only

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.260 
the air doesn't call your engine only
water<00:00:38.340> does<00:00:38.550> unless<00:00:38.820> you've<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> be

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
water does unless you've got to be

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
water does unless you've got to be
dubbed<00:00:39.480> from<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:39.809> back<00:00:39.960> yeah<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.770> air<00:00:40.890> calls

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
dubbed from way back yeah then air calls

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.580 
dubbed from way back yeah then air calls
it<00:00:41.280> George<00:00:41.760> um<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> idea<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.320> basically

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it George um but the idea is basically

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
it George um but the idea is basically
to<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> radiator<00:00:44.879> cap<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> highest

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to get the radiator cap at the highest

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.299 
to get the radiator cap at the highest
point<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> air<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
point because the air will go to the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
point because the air will go to the
highest<00:00:47.489> point<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.940> um<00:00:48.270> yeah<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.320> also

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
highest point and um yeah you can also

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040 
highest point and um yeah you can also
get<00:00:49.739> bleed<00:00:50.730> bucket<00:00:51.149> things<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.899> an

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
get bleed bucket things which is like an

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
get bleed bucket things which is like an
upside-down<00:00:52.410> bottle<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> puts<00:00:53.460> extra<00:00:53.730> fluid

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
upside-down bottle that puts extra fluid

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
upside-down bottle that puts extra fluid
in<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> error<00:00:54.840> eyes<00:00:54.989> stop<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
in and then the error eyes stop and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
in and then the error eyes stop and
bubbles<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.489> covered<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
bubbles out we have covered that in a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869 
bubbles out we have covered that in a
couple<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.800> different<00:00:58.800> episodes<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.399> think

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
couple of different episodes I think

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.250 
couple of different episodes I think
than<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> 180<00:01:00.930> yeah

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
than the one has you get on the 180 yeah

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.869 
than the one has you get on the 180 yeah
we<00:01:01.469> also<00:01:01.620> did<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> fluid<00:01:02.640> change

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
we also did like the fluid change

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
we also did like the fluid change
episode<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.809> maybe<00:01:03.989> here's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> crazy

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
episode I think maybe here's a crazy

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
episode I think maybe here's a crazy
idea<00:01:04.949> though<00:01:05.280> probably<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> best<00:01:05.970> thirty

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
idea though probably the best thirty

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.580 
idea though probably the best thirty
forty<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.570> fifty<00:01:06.659> dollars<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.140> spend<00:01:07.439> get

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
forty or fifty dollars you can spend get

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.899 
forty or fifty dollars you can spend get
a<00:01:07.619> hangs<00:01:07.830> manual<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.310> car<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
stuff really detailed doesn't make very

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500

exciting<00:01:11.670> videos<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> makes<00:01:12.360> good

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
exciting videos but it makes good

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.760

in<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> video<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.159> fiberglass<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
in a video if it's fiberglass is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
in a video if it's fiberglass is
basically<00:01:54.210> exactly<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> same<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
basically exactly the same thing so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
basically exactly the same thing so
there's<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.740> fibers<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.700> glass<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.240> make

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
there's actually fibers of glass to make

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
there's actually fibers of glass to make
it<00:01:57.540> hard<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> stiff<00:01:58.710> try<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it hard and stiff try and get like the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.980 
it hard and stiff try and get like the
matting<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> put<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> matting<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.899> then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
matting and you put the matting on then

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
matting and you put the matting on then
you<00:02:01.049> paint<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> resin<00:02:01.619> stuff<00:02:01.829> makes<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.189> super

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you paint the resin stuff makes it super

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.999 
you paint the resin stuff makes it super
hard<00:02:02.899> if<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> bump<00:02:04.680> ball<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
hard if you want to make a bump ball you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.440 
hard if you want to make a bump ball you
have<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> make<00:02:05.399> molds<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> plugs<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.240> another

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
have to make molds and plugs in another
