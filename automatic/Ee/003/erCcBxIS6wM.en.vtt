00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.620 
arcade game button fits into a pre-cut
hole<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:05.280> had<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.460> cut<00:02:06.610> an<00:02:06.700> extra<00:02:07.060> hole<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.510> was

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
hole I had to cut an extra hole that was

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.840 
hole I had to cut an extra hole that was
left<00:02:07.869> out<00:02:08.080> from<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.410> laser<00:02:08.590> cut<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> use

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
left out from the laser cut and so I use

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.030 
left out from the laser cut and so I use
this<00:02:10.030> hunting<00:02:10.360> knife<00:02:10.570> as<00:02:10.780> with<00:02:11.680> any<00:02:11.769> big

this hunting knife as with any big

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.100 
this hunting knife as with any big
project<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.820> occasional<00:02:13.360> hack<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> must

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
project the occasional hack is a must

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
project the occasional hack is a must
and<00:02:14.350> will<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.860> trick<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:16.330> i'm

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and will do the trick here i'm

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.330 
and will do the trick here i'm
installing<00:02:16.870> sound<00:02:17.350> insulation<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.250> the

holes<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.070> roof<00:02:29.190> top<00:02:29.430> support<00:02:29.850> system<00:02:30.240> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
holes in the roof top support system the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.620 
holes in the roof top support system the
rooftop<00:02:31.650> support<00:02:32.070> system<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:33.030> fastened<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
rooftop support system was fastened to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.330 
rooftop support system was fastened to
the<00:02:33.690> top<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> container<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.980> contained

point<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> controller<00:02:39.950> here<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.130> can

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
point for the controller here you can

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420 
point for the controller here you can
see<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> built<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.000> real<00:02:42.390> guided<00:02:42.960> through<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
see I built a real guided through and it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
see I built a real guided through and it
was<00:02:44.580> used<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:45.030> combination<00:02:45.360> with<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.900> steel

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
was used in combination with a steel

the<00:03:20.700> first<00:03:21.060> few<00:03:21.240> times<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.810> very<00:03:22.050> exciting

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the first few times was very exciting

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.380

and<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:23.190> was<00:03:23.280> pretty<00:03:23.460> cool<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.060> could<00:03:24.270> lose

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and it was pretty cool that I could lose

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.480 
and it was pretty cool that I could lose
the<00:03:24.570> control<00:03:24.750> side<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.560> side<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:25.980> up<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.280> down
