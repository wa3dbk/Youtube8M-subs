 percent the pasok to see what we were going to do 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.539
 was to start by unlocking our phone 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.589
 from telcel 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.060
 this entity as a team we have to open that center 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.070

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.370
 if they do not have 100% here 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.250
 we are going to be able to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 install anything 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.930
