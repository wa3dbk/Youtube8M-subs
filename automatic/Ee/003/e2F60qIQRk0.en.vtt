as a tutorial to understand and game

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
as a tutorial to understand and game
mechanics<00:00:45.270> you're<00:00:46.050> trying<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> catch<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
mechanics you're trying to catch up to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549 
mechanics you're trying to catch up to
the<00:00:47.820> kidnappers<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.780> took<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.350> your

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the kidnappers we took you know your

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.400 
the kidnappers we took you know your
love<00:00:49.800> there's<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.789> concept<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.079> being

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
love there's the concept of of being

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
love there's the concept of of being
quick<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.399> there's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.760> lot<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.600> twitch

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
quick so there's a lot of like twitch

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
quick so there's a lot of like twitch
game<00:00:55.140> mechanics<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:55.829> quickly<00:00:56.190> moving<00:00:56.399> back

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
game mechanics like quickly moving back

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
game mechanics like quickly moving back
and<00:00:56.850> forth<00:00:56.940> between<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.510> tracks<00:00:57.750> quickly

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
and forth between the tracks quickly

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.639 
and forth between the tracks quickly
avoiding<00:00:59.010> objects<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.730> being<00:00:59.969> slowed<00:01:00.270> down

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
avoiding objects not being slowed down

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
avoiding objects not being slowed down
you<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> three-hit<00:01:02.879> life

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you know there's a three-hit life

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.850 
you know there's a three-hit life
mechanics<00:01:03.840> over<00:01:03.989> hit<00:01:04.199> three<00:01:04.379> times<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
mechanics over hit three times you have

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.060 
mechanics over hit three times you have
to<00:01:04.949> restart<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> beginning<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to restart from the beginning so the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
to restart from the beginning so the
idea<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.210> quick<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
idea is that you want to be quick and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
idea is that you want to be quick and
efficient<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.229> move<00:01:10.680> through<00:01:10.920> things<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
efficient and move through things the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
efficient and move through things the
way<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.270> we've<00:01:12.540> conceived<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.650> next<00:01:14.130> levels

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
way that we've conceived the next levels

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
way that we've conceived the next levels
would<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.840> essentially

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
would be that there would be essentially

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
would be that there would be essentially
a<00:01:16.979> race<00:01:17.460> level<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.259> puzzle<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> platform

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
a race level a puzzle like a platform

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
a race level a puzzle like a platform
level<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.080> focus<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.259> puzzle<00:01:22.710> solving

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
level that focus more on puzzle solving

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
level that focus more on puzzle solving
and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.850> boss<00:01:24.270> battles<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.380> had

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and then boss battles and so we had

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
and then boss battles and so we had
planned<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.950> ten<00:01:26.280> different<00:01:26.549> essentially

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
planned for ten different essentially

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
planned for ten different essentially
worlds<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> could<00:01:28.380> play<00:01:28.979> through<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
worlds that you could play through and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
worlds that you could play through and
using<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> mechanic<00:01:30.540> well<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> puzzle

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
using that mechanic well for a puzzle

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
using that mechanic well for a puzzle
boss<00:01:32.220> fight<00:01:32.520> type<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.240> we've<00:01:34.140> also

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
boss fight type thing we've also

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.289 
boss fight type thing we've also
incorporated<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.310> idea<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> collectible<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
incorporated the idea of collectible so

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.960 
incorporated the idea of collectible so
you<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.600> currency<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.979> spend<00:01:38.759> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you have currency that you can spend in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.999 
you have currency that you can spend in
a<00:01:39.060> store<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> buy<00:01:39.960> upgrades<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.979> your

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a store and buy upgrades to your

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.300 
a store and buy upgrades to your
character<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.670> maybe<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.380> buy

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
character so maybe you know you can buy

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
character so maybe you know you can buy
types<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> armor<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.930> buy<00:01:46.049> types<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
types of armor you can buy types of

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
types of armor you can buy types of
clothing<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.159> aerodynamic<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
clothing that's more aerodynamic if you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
clothing that's more aerodynamic if you
run<00:01:48.270> faster<00:01:48.720> by<00:01:49.170> tennis<00:01:49.530> shoes<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.340> know

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
run faster by tennis shoes so you know

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.100 
run faster by tennis shoes so you know
your<00:01:50.820> feet<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.119> hurt<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> sands<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
your feet don't hurt the sands are you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.730 
your feet don't hurt the sands are you
clicker<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.700> battle<00:01:54.240> camel<00:01:54.689> has<00:01:55.560> an

we think is important when we're
producing<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> game<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.599> come<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.899> for
