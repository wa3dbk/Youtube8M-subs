 good drink 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.640
 I have always thought of good food 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.690

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.670
 sometimes the little spots outside 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.700
 I think they are UFO 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.880

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.090

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.240

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.640

 tower 1 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.099
 but it does not provide 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.560
 and before it is the grandmother, my view is 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.010
 worse 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.400

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.579
 When enough of games is time for books

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.419

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.830
 before he comes back 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.689

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.139

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:15.959

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:20.299
 discs playing video games the grandmother 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.299
 immerse yourself in some culture 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.550
 maybe I did not see him let her go 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.290
 worried 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.410
 a helpless old woman should not walk 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.710
 wandering around alone alone aguayo look what 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.710
 beautiful tower forget to leave no hope 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.480
 that is not worried hey do not think that 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.480
 we must go to look at the same time 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.190
 why 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.590
 for panama in santa cachucha ya 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.240
 we should know from her where she will be 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.419
 Clear 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.250
 that a giant ball of serum in should 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.819
 be a dinosaur talking about 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.949
 dinosaurs there is the grandmother you do not 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.410
 you're still mad at me, true doll 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.539
 given you do not know to be angry with me 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.860

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.860
 candy give me a smile 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.570
 and your smile 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.550
 what happens when you ask him to give you 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.980
 a hand 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.300
 it's been a full day but I think 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.300
 that the temperature is rising 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.790
 with that kind of temperature
