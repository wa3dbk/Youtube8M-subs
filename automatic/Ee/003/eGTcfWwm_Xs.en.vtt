the samsung galaxy tab 10.1 inch and
this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.679> running<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> big<00:00:14.759> iya<00:00:14.940> Tegra<00:00:15.599> 2

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
this is running and the big iya Tegra 2

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.599 
this is running and the big iya Tegra 2
processor<00:00:17.570> could<00:00:18.570> take<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> look<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.550> some<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
processor could take a look at some of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
processor could take a look at some of
the<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.850> specs<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.990> device<00:00:22.289> has

the other specs that this device has

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
the other specs that this device has
let's<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> settings<00:00:24.390> menu

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
so you can see it's only a running

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.900 
so you can see it's only a running
android<00:00:30.300> 3.0<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> heard<00:00:31.770> that<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.610> going

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.390 

so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.649> feeling<00:00:45.129> pretty<00:00:45.160> good<00:00:45.489> so<00:00:45.730> far

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.810 
see here looks like a speaker
and<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.390> other<00:00:52.510> side<00:00:52.870> too

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.270 

this<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.420> where<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:57.230> would<00:00:57.320> power<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.920> device

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
this is where you would power the device

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.079 
this is where you would power the device
and<00:00:58.700> this<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.500> power<00:01:00.500> charger<00:01:01.070> right<00:01:01.190> here

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.599 

you<00:01:04.659> can<00:01:04.780> see<00:01:04.989> here<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.920> power<00:01:06.280> up

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
you can see here this is the power up

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:11.099 
you can see here this is the power up
here<00:01:08.039> looks<00:01:09.039> like<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.609> is<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:10.240> 3.5<00:01:11.079> millimeter

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.109

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.429 
here looks like this is a 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:01:11.829> jack<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:13.030> can<00:01:13.210> see<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:13.810> it's<00:01:14.170> a

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
headphone jack you can see here it's a

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.959 
headphone jack you can see here it's a
webcam<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.310> front<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.799> also<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.429> webcam

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969
