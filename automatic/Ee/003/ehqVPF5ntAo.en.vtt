00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 there I am happy and today's the hint 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
 going to be very important is to optimize 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 your space is better than the zhar team 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.110
 is for this organization that you 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.560
 Make your home a lasting one. 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.150
 so I 'm going to use niche t-shirts that is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 one thing that all people have in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.070
 mainly men who use 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.070
 enough shirt and for what you fold 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 these T-shirts and they stay organized 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 in your closet 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 here we have an example of a closet 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 I really like how I organize and I go 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.500
 show you the difference of being 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 more organized in this space as 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 Stay, then let's see how it goes. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.280
 properly folded now we'll go 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.940
 converse accommodate and arrange by color 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 by shape by the functions 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 which tees at which is the choice 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.940
 How clear is fitness? 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.190
 then you will be able to separate 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 gaining space so I doubled the regatta 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.080
 from the bretas we 'll go 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.990
 I have the same parts 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.689
 I still have room for them because they 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.820
 been properly folded and I can 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.579
 to split up to enjoy a little better 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.700
 then organizing so it is easy to 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.280
 who will use it raises the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.520
 Loose back down shirt then it's 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.679
 an organization that will last the year 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.479
 the whole period the people were 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.549
 May hands and there will last 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.459
 So that was the tip today is 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.439
 organize and optimize the space, but 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:06.099
 This organization that's hard for you does not have 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.099
 what do you do again?
