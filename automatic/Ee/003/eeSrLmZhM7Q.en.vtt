to the side of the cabinet or you can
use<00:03:27.989> small<00:03:28.320> screws<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:29.070> put<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> velcro<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.660> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
use small screws I put the velcro in the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.819 
use small screws I put the velcro in the
back<00:03:31.400> stick<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.519> right<00:03:32.549> there<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:34.680> your

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
back stick it right there is your

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.530 
back stick it right there is your
thermal<00:03:35.430> sensor<00:03:35.910> you're<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.329> want<00:03:36.480> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
thermal sensor you're going to want to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.390 
thermal sensor you're going to want to
place<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.200> close<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> heat<00:03:38.130> source

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
place this close to the heat source

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.479 
place this close to the heat source
usually<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.420> can<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.570> tape<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.310> next<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
usually you can just tape it next to the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.460 
usually you can just tape it next to the
heat<00:03:41.670> source<00:03:41.880> or<00:03:42.180> put<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.540> top<00:03:42.780> piece<00:03:43.440> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
heat source or put it on top piece of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.620 
heat source or put it on top piece of
tape

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
tape

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.510 
tape
then<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.290> want<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.530> use<00:03:45.590> screws<00:03:46.040> your<00:03:46.220> power

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
then you want to use screws your power

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.000 
then you want to use screws your power
is<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.540> AC<00:03:47.750> adapter<00:03:50.710> plugs<00:03:51.710> in<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.900> the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
is the AC adapter plugs in to the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.050 
is the AC adapter plugs in to the
thermal<00:03:55.010> controller<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:56.660> plugs<00:03:57.020> in<00:03:58.060> to

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
thermal controller and this plugs in to

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.910 
thermal controller and this plugs in to
an<00:03:59.180> AC<00:03:59.360> source

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920

let's<00:04:06.920> plugged<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:07.600> should<00:04:08.600> be<00:04:08.750> an<00:04:08.840> LED<00:04:09.350> power

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
let's plugged in should be an LED power
