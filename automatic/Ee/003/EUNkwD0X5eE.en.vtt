00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.810
 It did not succeed commercially 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.829
 Receiving after the constant 14 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.629
 It appeared in January 1999 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.640
 Seventh generation 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 Is the number 1 Silvia 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.179
 Constant 15 is the maximum point 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.970
 Its body size 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.779
 Same as when Mr. Constant 1 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.779
 It is that I pulled back the 5 number rate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.980
 There 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 Cut off the lost as a luxury model 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 Clarified the direction as an affordable size fr sport 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 Nissan's doctor was appearing strongly 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.200
 The mounted engine is 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.360
 Constant 113 has continued to 14 people 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 Continued adoption of sra201 series 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 further 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.210
 The specifications for which fine tuning has advanced 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.280
 nabe 165 horsepower 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.640
 19.6 kg meter 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 Next in Turbo 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.250
 2150 horsepower 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 It came to generate 28.0 kg meters 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.340
 By the way 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 Constant 13 Constant 14 continued 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 Trump fw grade name min 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.180
 Changed this time 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.160
 The downturn is thrown away 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.100
 Card is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.830
 A two-grade wintering corps was said to have a step 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.150
 The manual mission of stec is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.590
 I have six legs 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 Around the photo 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.890
 Although inherited it of constant 13s14 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.620
 To appeal fr sports 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 A major overhaul was favored 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 Body rigidity up and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.070
 Brake strengthening 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.100
 Suspension or sports 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.680
 Massive results such as adoption of helical lsd 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.979
 Acquire high performance that surpasses predecessors 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.529
 ing 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.969
 With a 250 hp engine 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.339
 There is a spec that can be combined with articles of the six foot garden 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.219
 Power weight ratio too 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.799
 Per horsepower 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.779
 4.96 kg 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 I boasted a general number rather than 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.589
 It is currently used and is a numerical value with a casting method 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.859
 If there are 5 numbers of 2 liter naif 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.859
 It is an excellent performance 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.769
 Handling is also ideal seasoning 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.249
 While having high limit performance 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.639
 I had money for maneuverability of freedom 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.169
 In 2000 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.199
 Convertible model equipped with na engine 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.199
 Marietta was introduced 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.839
 It was the only compact fr in Japan 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.249
 It is s1 Australia 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.179
 As we did not clear 2010 exhaust gas regulation 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.509
 After August 2002 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.509
 Production can not be continued 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.559
 Thus is an example 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:29.309
 Requested in 1965 lasted 38 years ago 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.959
 Put an end
