 videos because I have not done in 2014 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.520
 I already want to look at the batteries 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.010

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.530
 Well the first thing we're going to see is that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.250
 I come carrying two juegazos two 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.989
 They lived two games because two courts 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.140
 because for me they are the best games 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.460
 that exist but well the first one is gta 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.950
 san andrés and the other one is gta 7 vw good 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.020
 I do not know how to pronounce the name never 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.559
 I had played but it's really the one that 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.480
 liked more 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.640

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.190

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 has some graphics what was 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.290
 seeing that it has a lot of appearance of 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.579
 gta 4 map and I loved that game and 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.140
 I'll leave it here below the 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.970
 description of the video and if you want to know 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.710
 a little more want if with me to 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.170
 be able to know a little more about these two 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 so cool and beautiful games that can 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.520
 be several friends keep your hands 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.290
 up if you like, subscribe yes 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 favor and bye bye 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 we'll see each other to see how the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 games you, you 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 i 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 you do not see 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.689
 and we already returned then the only thing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.939
 we must know how to install these two 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.280
 games is to download the file the two 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.600
 files if they want the game of gta san 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 andrés and the same ones leaving in a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.410
 obviously compressed file is going to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 come what is the folder and the the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.349
 kitchen is the pica sorry I was the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.730
 wave but good and how to install good 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.170
 it's not that they downloaded what is the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.750
 york file is no longer I have 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.049
 files because they weigh a lot this maximum 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.349
 the gta san andrés comes weighing me 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.750
 maximum four or up to 22 gigabytes of 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.090
 memory it is recommended that you pass it to 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.209
 the microsd memory because it's faster 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.130
 and it's more fluid than internal memory 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.069
 but good the only thing they have to do 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.030
 is to go to what is your browser 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.190
 files or from the pc 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.540
 and go to the file browser once 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.790
 that they are inside they will leave a 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.920
 folder you unzip it and the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.770
 folder for example here I have now the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.840
 installer of this and in the folder that 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.720
 come the installer and another folder that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.950
 they see it and what is it that they are going to go 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 here where is 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.340
 android and the folder that comes the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.060
 they're going to put in here that baby is so young 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.950
 for example here 7 point com dot 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.170
 rockstar that is the one of san andrés the one that 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.850
 comes with the logo san andrés that folder 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.580
 will come to you in the compressed file 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.100
 who left them that folder they're going to put 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.640
 here where it says or babies and if they do not have 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.880
 that folder in the root of android 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.400
 you create it you create it from your pc or 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.950
 from here they create it and they put or drink it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.050
 very easy and already in the installation once 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.240
 that already have the installation are going to 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.720
 install what is the pk and point 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.660
 same with this one 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.950
 well it 's very easy and simple also it 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.460
 I will leave you below description of the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.140
 video installations step by step no 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.300
 I do them because I do not have the files 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.160
 how to do it and if I do them I'm going to 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.230
 spend more memory and I do not want to spend 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.510
 much more memory 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.580
 but good let's count a little more 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.629
 these two wonderful games good 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.379
 gta san andrés is for android systems 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:12.220
 but the problem that exists more android 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:16.840
 3.0 up ok and this one says gta 7 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.600
 w is the one for android 4.0 up 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.820
 I do not know why but honestly I think 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.310
 that yes it is good for the graphics that I 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.479
 they loved it was not a chulada 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.310
 graphics fascinated me and really 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.889
 I do not know if I recorded it right now and I stopped 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.260
 the video but good also right now 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.030
 may be commenting on intros or the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 I will leave here in the description of 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.770
 video of how the centers are so that 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.560
 you can see it because if I download the 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.479
 centers and I'm putting in my hd video 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.490
 speaking or whether I will be much 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.930
 longer the video but good friends 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.729
 I hope you liked them just 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.080
 I've been bringing those two games down 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.240
 video team left them as 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.529
 install them and how to play them because 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.809
 honestly they are a chulada 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.229
 this the gta san andrés I already told him 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:05.869
 maximum 4 to 2 gb maximum 2 gigas goes 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.119
 weigh and this one weighs them not half of a 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.279
 giga is very light this but 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:11.929
 honestly if it's a little bit late 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.239
 where it downloads the one that takes longer in 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:16.009
 Download 7 to shake good friends 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:18.049
 I recommend the installation what 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.909
 do from your pc move the folders 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:22.009
 to make it easier and simpler I will 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.919
 I do like that if it has not started then 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.749
 unzip them from your cell phone and good 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.249
 equally but it will take a little 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.259
 Good friends, I hope you have them 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.089
 liked his friend schaaf goodbye here 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.789
 remix because I have to be much more 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.829
 videos and upload more content for this 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.959
 2015 good friends, I wish you the best 

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:41.359
 see you later, friends will come 

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:43.009
 bringing new videos equally a 

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:45.859
 new application to be able to record your 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.349
 screen without being root and now what 

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:50.599
 I'm seeing is an application but the 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.249
 only problem that they have to be is that 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:57.679
 they have to be 4.2 maximum no if 4.2 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.289
 maximum up to be able to record without 

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:03.050
 be root in 4.1 no longer 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:07.029
 Fucked for friends 6 ask here your
