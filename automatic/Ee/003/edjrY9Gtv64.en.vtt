okay so welcome to part 6 the last part
of<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.620> tutorial<00:00:04.770> series<00:00:05.870> I'm<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
of this tutorial series I'm going to

show<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.189> tutorial<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.670> last<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
show you in this tutorial the last one I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.120 
show you in this tutorial the last one I
showed<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.510> make<00:00:09.780> flat<00:00:10.110> bases<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:10.889> 3d

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
showed you how to make flat bases for 3d

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.350 
showed you how to make flat bases for 3d
printing<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.000> I'm<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> show

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
printing and this one I'm going to show

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.410 
printing and this one I'm going to show
you<00:00:12.389> how<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> deal<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:14.000> overhangs<00:00:15.000> which<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
you how to deal with overhangs which is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.970 
you how to deal with overhangs which is
another<00:00:15.599> problem<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.260> run<00:00:16.379> into<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.740> 3d

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
another problem you can run into for 3d

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.029 
another problem you can run into for 3d
printing<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> create

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
printing so I'm just going to create

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.650 
printing so I'm just going to create
sort<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.939> overhang<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> was<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.630> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
sort of an overhang if I was going to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.570 
sort of an overhang if I was going to
print<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> flat<00:00:22.800> base<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> top

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
print this from the flat base to the top

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.109 
print this from the flat base to the top
then<00:00:24.480> something<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.880> would<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.000> an

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
then something like this would be an

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
then something like this would be an
overhang<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.099> see<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.220> even<00:00:29.400> kind<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
overhang and see it's even kind of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.339 
overhang and see it's even kind of
skewed<00:00:30.029> sideways<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.750> way<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.019> probably

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
skewed sideways this way is probably

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.650 
skewed sideways this way is probably
okay<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.550> part<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.000> isn't<00:00:33.180> me<00:00:33.300> trouble

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
okay but this part here isn't me trouble

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290 
okay but this part here isn't me trouble
so<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so one thing we can do is we go to the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.200 
so one thing we can do is we go to the
selection<00:00:36.660> tool<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.440> I'll<00:00:38.129> show<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.940> need

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
selection tool and I'll show you we need

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
selection tool and I'll show you we need
to<00:00:39.329> select<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:39.960> bit<00:00:40.079> carefully<00:00:40.559> I'm

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to select a little bit carefully I'm

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
to select a little bit carefully I'm
gonna<00:00:41.700> select<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.149> bit<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> bottom<00:00:42.840> here

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
gonna select a bit on the bottom here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.490 
gonna select a bit on the bottom here
I'm<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:44.789> select<00:00:45.230> right<00:00:46.230> underneath<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
I'm gonna select right underneath it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.060 
I'm gonna select right underneath it
another<00:00:49.500> piece

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
another piece

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.209 
another piece
those<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.670> lined<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.469> not<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
those two are lined up not at all so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.010 
those two are lined up not at all so
let's<00:00:53.430> try<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.699> from<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.120> angle

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.000 

when<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.469> underneath<00:00:58.770> each

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
when I get them right underneath each

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
when I get them right underneath each
other<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.699> don't<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> create

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
other because we don't want to create

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
other because we don't want to create
another<00:01:00.899> overhanging<00:01:01.530> okay<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
another overhanging okay so now we go to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.119 
another overhanging okay so now we go to
modify<00:01:03.210> selection<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.320> we've<00:01:04.500> boundary<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
modify selection just we've boundary and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.050 
modify selection just we've boundary and
that's<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.489> smooth<00:01:05.880> those

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that's gonna just smooth those

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.340 
that's gonna just smooth those
boundaries<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:06.990> kind<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
boundaries and make them kind of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.030 
boundaries and make them kind of
circular<00:01:07.979> nice<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> clean<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.650> edits

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
circular nice and clean now I go edits

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.109 
circular nice and clean now I go edits
and<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.510> bridge<00:01:13.110> handle<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.280> what

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and we go to bridge handle and what

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.340 
and we go to bridge handle and what
that's<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.750> create<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> tube

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that's gonna do is gonna create a tube

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.899 
that's gonna do is gonna create a tube
between<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.130> selections<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> only

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
between those two selections so it only

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.999 
between those two selections so it only
works<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:18.450> selections<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> see

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
works with two selections but you see

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
works with two selections but you see
now<00:01:20.189> I've<00:01:20.369> got<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> strut<00:01:21.659> underneath

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
now I've got a sort of strut underneath

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.880 
now I've got a sort of strut underneath
this<00:01:22.830> overhang<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.020> now<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.409> hit<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this overhang and now I can hit a to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.330 
this overhang and now I can hit a to
accept<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:28.290> cancel<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
accept that and we cancel out of the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
accept that and we cancel out of the
selection<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.869> see<00:01:31.079> I've<00:01:31.860> kind<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
selection and you see I've kind of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
selection and you see I've kind of
improved<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> situation<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
improved the situation here now this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
improved the situation here now this
still<00:01:34.409> might<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.220> printable<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> might

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
still might not be printable you might

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.890 
still might not be printable you might
want<00:01:36.119> us<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.750> bit

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
want us in here you know make it a bit

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
want us in here you know make it a bit
rounder<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> part<00:01:41.400> maybe<00:01:41.549> you'd

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
rounder so this is a part maybe you'd

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
rounder so this is a part maybe you'd
cut<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.630> strut<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.049> afterwards<00:01:43.590> or

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
cut this the strut out afterwards or

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.520 
cut this the strut out afterwards or
something<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.899> but<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.320> those

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
something like that but we can do those

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
something like that but we can do those
we<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.920> remember<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.220> said<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> volume

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we can remember I said in the volume

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.249 
we can remember I said in the volume
brush<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.630> said<00:01:49.290> brush<00:01:49.649> mode<00:01:50.280> e1<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.899> good<00:01:52.110> for

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
brush I said brush mode e1 was good for

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
brush I said brush mode e1 was good for
kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> filling<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.030> fill

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
kind of filling in it's kind of a fill

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.850 
kind of filling in it's kind of a fill
brush<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.170> go

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
brush so you can do that you just go

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
brush so you can do that you just go
underneath<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.450> know<00:02:00.570> paint<00:02:00.930> in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
underneath and kind of you know paint in

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.149 
underneath and kind of you know paint in
some<00:02:01.409> support<00:02:03.500> until<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.619> feel<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
some support until you feel like the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.839 
some support until you feel like the
angles<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.759> okay<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:07.129> you're<00:02:08.129> gonna<00:02:08.250> have

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
angles are okay that you're gonna have

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.630 
angles are okay that you're gonna have
enough<00:02:09.179> support<00:02:09.569> underneath

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
enough support underneath

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.240 
enough support underneath
for<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:10.970> part<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.990> that<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.650> fill<00:02:15.860> brush<00:02:16.070> is

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
for this part so that that fill brush is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.040 
for this part so that that fill brush is
good<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.000> know<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.480> really<00:02:17.690> really

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
good you know if you have really really

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.000 
good you know if you have really really
slight<00:02:19.180> overhangs<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:21.320> know<00:02:21.410> something<00:02:21.860> like

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
slight overhangs you know something like

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.390 
slight overhangs you know something like
this<00:02:22.750> maybe<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.590> don't<00:02:24.770> want<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.950> go<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.220> there

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
this maybe you don't want to go in there

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
this maybe you don't want to go in there
and<00:02:25.520> actually<00:02:25.640> add<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> strut<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.900> just

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
and actually add a strut you can just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.700 
and actually add a strut you can just
use<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.230> d1<00:02:27.800> brush<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:30.050> go<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.440> look<00:02:30.560> from

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
use that d1 brush and go and look from

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.770 
use that d1 brush and go and look from
the<00:02:30.800> side<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.090> even<00:02:32.330> make<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.480> really

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
the side you can even make it really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020 
the side you can even make it really
small<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.470> kind<00:02:33.710> of<00:02:33.770> scribble<00:02:34.160> from<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
small and just kind of scribble from the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.550 
small and just kind of scribble from the
side<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:37.430> make<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.910> support<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
side to make a support for it if you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.070 
side to make a support for it if you
turn<00:02:39.830> up<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.070> strength<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:40.790> can<00:02:41.690> sort<00:02:42.050> of

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
turn up the strength you can sort of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.790 
turn up the strength you can sort of
make<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.650> come<00:02:43.640> out<00:02:44.209> faster<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.650> that

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
make it come out faster and so that

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.080 
make it come out faster and so that
might<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.130> bit<00:02:46.340> easier<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.670> cut<00:02:46.940> out

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
might be a bit easier to cut out

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.400 
might be a bit easier to cut out
afterwards<00:02:47.630> if<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.840> need<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.110> do<00:02:48.230> some

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
afterwards if you need to do some

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
afterwards if you need to do some
cutting<00:02:48.700> okay<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:50.989> just<00:02:51.140> going<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.290> show

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
cutting okay so I'm just going to show

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.860 
cutting okay so I'm just going to show
you<00:02:51.410> one<00:02:51.620> more<00:02:51.650> thing<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:53.390> these<00:02:53.540> examples

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
you one more thing in these examples

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.720 
you one more thing in these examples
that<00:02:54.170> everything<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.709> basically<00:02:55.430> worked

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that everything is basically worked

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.800 
that everything is basically worked
really<00:02:55.850> well<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.300> models<00:02:56.630> been

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
really well and the models been

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.300 
really well and the models been
watertight<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.470> whole<00:02:57.590> time<00:02:57.800> but<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.100> lot<00:02:58.280> of

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
watertight the whole time but a lot of

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.330 
watertight the whole time but a lot of
times<00:02:59.050> in<00:03:00.050> your<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.770> know<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.040> imports

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
times in your you know if you imports

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.030 
times in your you know if you imports
can<00:03:01.670> re<00:03:02.060> or<00:03:02.300> even<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.260> using<00:03:03.440> mesh<00:03:03.709> mix<00:03:03.920> or

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
can re or even just using mesh mix or

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.890 
can re or even just using mesh mix or
some<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.340> tools<00:03:04.550> will<00:03:04.820> fail<00:03:05.060> sometimes<00:03:05.390> or

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
some of the tools will fail sometimes or

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.050 
some of the tools will fail sometimes or
introduce<00:03:06.830> errors<00:03:07.220> like<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.430> handle<00:03:07.910> tool

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
introduce errors like this handle tool

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.479 
introduce errors like this handle tool
sometimes<00:03:08.390> will<00:03:08.810> leave<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.959> little<00:03:09.220> hole<00:03:10.220> at

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
sometimes will leave a little hole at

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.729 
sometimes will leave a little hole at
near<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.700> base<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:12.050> same<00:03:12.260> with<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> drop

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
near the base and the same with the drop

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.690 
near the base and the same with the drop
apart<00:03:13.489> drops<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:14.840> leave<00:03:15.049> holes<00:03:15.290> sometimes<00:03:15.700> so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
apart drops can leave holes sometimes so

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
apart drops can leave holes sometimes so
you<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:17.810> detect<00:03:18.080> where<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.410> holes<00:03:18.590> are<00:03:18.799> by

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you can detect where the holes are by

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.030 
you can detect where the holes are by
running<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.549> inspector<00:03:20.150> tool<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.650> inspector

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
running the inspector tool the inspector

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800 
running the inspector tool the inspector
tool<00:03:22.190> will<00:03:22.340> point<00:03:22.580> out<00:03:22.790> like<00:03:23.209> there's<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.570> hole

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
tool will point out like there's a hole

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.280 
tool will point out like there's a hole
here<00:03:24.080> if<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:24.440> some<00:03:24.650> more<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.989> know<00:03:27.019> even

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
here if I make some more you know even

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.509 
here if I make some more you know even
really<00:03:27.470> little<00:03:27.739> ones<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.160> might<00:03:28.340> not

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
really little ones that you might not

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.539 
really little ones that you might not
notice<00:03:29.380> there's<00:03:30.380> just<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:30.769> face<00:03:31.070> missing

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
notice there's just one face missing

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.890 
notice there's just one face missing
there<00:03:31.700> but<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.880> inspector<00:03:32.330> will<00:03:32.510> point<00:03:32.780> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
there but the inspector will point it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.289 
there but the inspector will point it
out<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.620> well<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.400> stick<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.850> going<00:03:35.090> through

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
out so well that stick is going through

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.000 
out so well that stick is going through
the<00:03:35.390> model<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:35.870> it's<00:03:36.530> telling<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.830> there's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
the model but it's telling you there's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.860 
the model but it's telling you there's
three<00:03:37.220> problems<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.360> well<00:03:38.480> then<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:38.720> can

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
three problems and so well then you can

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.300 
three problems and so well then you can
do<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.290> can<00:03:39.350> go<00:03:39.470> through<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.160> can

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
do is you can go through and you can

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.210 
do is you can go through and you can
click<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:40.670> those<00:03:41.260> these<00:03:42.260> balls<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.830> if<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:43.010> click

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
click on those these balls so if I click

better to kind of go one by one because
you<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.190> see<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:58.430> happens<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.880> one<00:03:59.000> thing

you can do is if if you want to manually

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440 
you can do is if if you want to manually

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
fix it you can right click on that ball

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.780 
fix it you can right click on that ball
and<00:04:05.720> that'll<00:04:05.989> select<00:04:06.410> around<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.400> boundary

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
and that'll select around the boundary

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.090 
and that'll select around the boundary
and<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.120> for<00:04:08.450> instance<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.840> could<00:04:09.019> run<00:04:09.230> you

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
and now for instance I could run you

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100 
and now for instance I could run you
remember<00:04:10.579> I<00:04:10.850> showed<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.239> earlier<00:04:11.269> on<00:04:11.660> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
remember I showed you earlier on the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.289 
remember I showed you earlier on the
erase<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.650> fill<00:04:12.829> tool<00:04:13.070> which<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.180> get

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
erase and fill tool which is you can get

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.140 
erase and fill tool which is you can get
to<00:04:14.390> by<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.570> F<00:04:14.780> hotkey

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
to by the F hotkey

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.300 
to by the F hotkey
so<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.209> run<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.769> will<00:04:19.949> fill<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
so you run that and that will fill the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.580 
so you run that and that will fill the
hole<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:20.789> can<00:04:20.940> accept<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:22.139> now<00:04:22.289> we<00:04:22.349> got

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
hole and you can accept and now we got

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.439 
hole and you can accept and now we got
rid<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.919> hole<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.910> I'd<00:04:24.030> any<00:04:24.270> time

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
rid of that hole and so I'd any time

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:25.580 
rid of that hole and so I'd any time
it's<00:04:24.599> going<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.810> know<00:04:24.960> is<00:04:25.169> your<00:04:25.289> model

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
it's going to know is your model

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.020 
it's going to know is your model
watertight<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.099> just<00:04:26.280> run<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.490> inspector

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
watertight you just run the inspector

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170 
watertight you just run the inspector
and<00:04:27.240> if<00:04:27.360> no<00:04:27.800> balls<00:04:28.800> pop<00:04:29.159> up<00:04:29.400> your<00:04:29.699> model<00:04:30.030> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and if no balls pop up your model is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.010 
and if no balls pop up your model is
watertight

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
watertight

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.719 
watertight
I<00:04:31.050> might<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.889> self<00:04:32.129> intersections

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
I might have self intersections

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.670 
I might have self intersections
inspector<00:04:33.690> doesn't<00:04:33.840> detect<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.349> right<00:04:34.530> now

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
inspector doesn't detect that right now

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.629 
inspector doesn't detect that right now
but<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.520> watertight<00:04:37.250> okay<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.310> let's<00:04:38.580> see

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
but it is watertight okay so let's see

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.129 
but it is watertight okay so let's see
into<00:04:38.759> that<00:04:38.819> tutorial<00:04:39.330> that's<00:04:39.419> how<00:04:39.569> you<00:04:39.629> can

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
into that tutorial that's how you can

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.659 
into that tutorial that's how you can
kind<00:04:40.409> of<00:04:40.470> use<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.770> modeling<00:04:41.099> tools<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.520> deal

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
kind of use the modeling tools to deal

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.850 
kind of use the modeling tools to deal
with<00:04:41.699> overhangs<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.509> fill<00:04:43.229> holes<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.680> things

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
with overhangs and fill holes and things

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.249 
with overhangs and fill holes and things
like<00:04:44.009> that<00:04:44.069> in<00:04:44.340> case<00:04:44.520> they<00:04:44.699> pop<00:04:44.909> up<00:04:45.259> okay

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
like that in case they pop up okay

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.190 
like that in case they pop up okay
that's<00:04:46.949> it
