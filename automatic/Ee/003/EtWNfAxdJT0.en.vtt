00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello everyone that such a good today I bring you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 a video where I want to show you a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 product that sent me a page the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.810
 same yours the same page that I 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 sent and those extensions of tabs 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.030
 that I said they were fiber I'll put the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 link here so you can not know why 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.500
 what about here in case you do not know what it is and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 Well, this same company sent me 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.180
 these markers that are to do the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.320
 French manicure 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.890
 with some markers that look like 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.239
 this the tip is the correctors that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.190
 we use when the best is that 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.780
 we live and we go wrong and we erase and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 then to write over as well 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.700
 this one has the truth is that the liquid 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.170
 have those people have that texture and 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.750
 good to me the truth is that this kind of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.120
 product has never called me the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.730
 Attention, well, well, I do the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 French manicure with enamels 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.960
 whites but it never catches my attention 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.770
 because I'm not going to how it started as 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.420
 a marker but when I sent it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.210
 the truth is that he uses it and I 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.200
 I personally do French manicure to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.390
 the clients 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.220
 but I 'm super self 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.690
 impossible to make my right hand with the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.030
 left declaim right not if camps 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.520
 so it's superior to my strength it comes out to me 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.860
 fatal and good because I've tried with 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 this highlighter and the truth is that it has 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.039
 been a total discovery 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.380
 and the truth is that I love it, I like it 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.170
 a lot because for the same to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.610
 Caesar the same one is super comfortable to see no 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.700
 it looks like an enamel because 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.280
 Well, it's not a highlighter but good 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.590
 I'll wear it for you 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.530
 fatal because it already leads to see if we are 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.020
 Friday I've been wearing it since Monday 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.380
 but look how good I'm wearing a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.179
 base and I wear the transparent base 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 I have put this one of kiko that is for 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.869
 French manicure in number 211 then 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.329
 took the marker given of not been 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.239
 put the French line and then 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.760
 I have the 2 kiko cut 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.620
 I taught my life but if also 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.620
 possible by itself not 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.430
 and the truth is that as I tell you that a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.019
 total discovery look that is fatal 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.819
 because they have been there for quite a few days 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.330
 It is very damaged but good for what 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.330
 or why 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.070
 you have in your hand the solution that stops 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.770
 the best for the same because good 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.210
 or good that you are a person but 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.010
 good if you know how to do the registration 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.410
 French with enamel as it is more 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.820
 nice is more colorful and is more 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.260
 elegant but good for a person 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.870
 same that you are not able to do are very 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.180
 hours that is fatal because the truth is 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.640
 that this to wear the nails arranged 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.290
 that you do not love yourself or that you wear a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.210
 bit in a hurry and you want to do a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.760
 moment the truth is that the truth is 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.370
 that a total and good discovery 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 that's the discovery that I made the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.360
 true that with this product that no no 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.940
 I say you buy this product but to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.280
 the best shipping costs the web as 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.660
 it's better foreign but let's not 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.100
 have problems because I bought 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.370
 some things after ordering 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.049
 of although I would have sent 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.569
 fiber eyelash extensions 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.370
 I bought some things for nails and reindeer 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.950
 I remember in the shipping costs but not 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.379
 They were a lot and they sent you too 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.720
 soon but good that simply this 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.790
 video to show you this and so for 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.670
 example you see this type of products 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.799
 that are natural that for me it was that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.030
 I did not trust because I had not 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.340
 this product got a lot of attention 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.860
 for being a marker but tell you that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.200
 it works very well I do not know how long it will last 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.970
 you know how good they are markers that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.480
 the markers to be even though they are 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.890
 closed but good evaporates more the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.170
 product that for example a glaze that 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.060
 you know it's so late with crystals and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.910
 good that lasts a lot more but good 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.760
 what I wanted to do this video so that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.319
 to give my opinion about this product 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.359
 Good thing I loved that for 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.700
 I'm a discovery because I do not know 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.100
 do less alone with the elephant 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 until I get out 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.160
 and well this video is very short 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.660
 it was simply to teach gestures to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.430
 that you enter the web if you want to take 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.900
 a look to see the price they have 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.270
 these ways I will put it here 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.100
 also and good to see things a little 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.520
 they have and the shipping and other costs 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.960
 and good to say to you that very many 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.260
 thank you for watching me I hope that I have 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 liked that it has served above all 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.110
 I send a huge kiss and see you in the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.110
 next unthinked days
