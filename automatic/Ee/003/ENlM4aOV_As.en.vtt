00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:13.110
 almost welcome in that enamel vi 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 put today is the 656 cupcake bean 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.100
 nail lacquer then the edition 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.410
 spring 2014 kiko this aspect a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.430
 quite thin grain that is neither nor a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.580
 neither sandblasted nor another carrier 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 type and this is called cupcake 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 certain effect exists in many 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 pastel colors of spring novelties 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.930
 of kiko 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.059
 this is the second color I feel 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 from the bottle it should be a type 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.260
 green line a very yellow green on 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.180
 to yellow faded fruits by finger 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 very ugly in my opinion with these 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:59.730
 granules of predominantly blue color and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.980
 I do not recommend this color orange 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.510
 I had not much more than the other 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 still decided if you liked the effect 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 I tried and if 55 seems to me that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.080
 color you do I haven't decided yet if 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 you liked the effect but at least 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.430
 despite the estate was a lot 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.100
 low and rightly with a touch you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.670
 he would lose his grain effect 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.909
 his we say grit seal his 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 roughness despite the seal being 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 very few days at least 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 a few days in bed with his 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.880
 this effect in completeness instead 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 since the first one had started 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.280
 losing pieces had not dried in the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.399
 adequately he had not spent much 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 well he had remained very thin in some 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.670
 points there a lot and a lot 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.960
 material in others is practically smooth 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 smooth but not good and without material e 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 it is ruined immediately i am looking forward to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.540
 removing it means that I will not buy any more 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 kiko cupcake lacquer I don't know if 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 advise you if I'm not mistaken they cost 3 euros 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 90 something like that if you want 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.450
 take off the whim 1 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.310
 buy it is not that you go bad though 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 I recommend you first look a lot 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.959
 nails on display to understand 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.739
 really the effect it gives to the touch 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.720
 this effect 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.640
 I did it despite myself and I was 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.580
 deluded that he could like it much more 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.580
 and so it was not a kiss bye
