00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
focus that might be on the road we did

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
focus that might be on the road we did
start<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> all-new<00:00:45.660> design<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
start with the all-new design of the

start with the all-new design of the
pelvis<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.039> added<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.579> things<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.030> make

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
pelvis and we added two things to make

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
pelvis and we added two things to make
it<00:00:48.660> even<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:49.760> performance<00:00:50.760> friendly<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it even more performance friendly and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
it even more performance friendly and
everything<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.399> only

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
everything you see on here is not only

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.700 
everything you see on here is not only
for<00:00:53.850> looks<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.210> also<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.840> certain

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
for looks that's also for certain

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
for looks that's also for certain
functions<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.370> important<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.850> our<00:00:56.940> neck

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
functions so important is our neck

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
functions so important is our neck
because

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
because
that's<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.590> faceless<00:00:59.040> right<00:00:59.220> now<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.610> back

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's one faceless right now so back

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.880 
that's one faceless right now so back
here<00:01:00.030> rear<00:01:00.660> diffuser<00:01:00.899> let's<00:01:01.470> head<00:01:01.620> home<00:01:01.739> with

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.570 
pound feet of torque so this little car
is<00:02:39.520> definitely<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> move<00:02:40.920> speed<00:02:41.920> manual

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
is definitely going to move speed manual

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.850 
is definitely going to move speed manual
transmission<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.930> your<00:02:44.140> only<00:02:44.290> choice<00:02:44.620> it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
transmission that is your only choice it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.730 
transmission that is your only choice it
is<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.010> short<00:02:45.280> prose<00:02:45.670> shift<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.450> very<00:02:47.140> accurate

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
is a short prose shift so very accurate

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.130 
is a short prose shift so very accurate
shifting<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.280> it's<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.490> bit<00:02:48.880> hands<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.960> able

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
shifting and it's a bit hands to be able

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
shifting and it's a bit hands to be able
to<00:02:50.230> handle<00:02:50.500> all<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.070> horsepower<00:02:51.490> and

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to handle all of that horsepower and

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.660 
to handle all of that horsepower and
torque<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:53.470> first<00:02:53.830> time<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.250> guys<00:02:54.400> been

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
torque and the first time you guys been

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.940 
torque and the first time you guys been
begging<00:02:55.120> for<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> while<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.710> our

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
begging for this for a while we have our

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.370 
begging for this for a while we have our
Ford<00:02:57.280> informants<00:02:58.000> all-wheel<00:02:58.660> drive<00:02:59.080> with

Ford informants all-wheel drive with
dynamic<00:02:59.890> torque<00:03:00.130> vectoring<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:01.180> going

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
dynamic torque vectoring so it's going

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.230 
dynamic torque vectoring so it's going
to<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.540> an<00:03:01.600> exciting<00:03:02.080> car<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.710> drive<00:03:02.950> as<00:03:03.490> going

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
to be an exciting car to drive as going

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.600 
to be an exciting car to drive as going
to<00:03:04.300> be<00:03:04.390> really<00:03:04.870> officer<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.470> those<00:03:05.680> curves<00:03:06.100> and
