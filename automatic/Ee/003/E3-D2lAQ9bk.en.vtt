00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
right in the face and that should be it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.900 
right in the face and that should be it
maybe<00:04:40.650> two<00:04:40.830> or<00:04:40.949> three<00:04:41.100> shots<00:04:41.310> should<00:04:41.490> kill<00:04:41.699> him

event I might as well pick it up right
so<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.890> think<00:06:24.190> I<00:06:24.310> take<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.580> wrong<00:06:24.700> path<00:06:24.760> ik

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
so I think I take the wrong path ik

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.480 
so I think I take the wrong path ik
picking<00:06:25.450> up<00:06:25.540> this<00:06:25.660> thing<00:06:25.930> over<00:06:26.200> here<00:06:26.620> but<00:06:27.130> it's

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.860 
picking up this thing over here but it's
not<00:06:27.610> really<00:06:27.910> gonna<00:06:28.030> matter<00:06:28.210> too<00:06:28.480> much

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
not really gonna matter too much

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.240
