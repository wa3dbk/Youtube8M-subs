00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi dear viewers in this series we 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 let's see a rather interesting Khorezm 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.980
 allowing to change the weather from rainy to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.320
 sun on your servers roll here 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.490
 rain call force lag client say yes 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.559
 Where 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.480
 Well, just wants to enter the delivery team 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 rain that is to make all crawling 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.140
 automatically protecting you 3 it works 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.880
 turn on the rain going on 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.279
 the action of the cake itself stops and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 action loops 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 Well, how does it work using the system? 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 warp and died common beech well of these hundred 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 command units Versailles on May 4th craft 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 the last most so on let's go right away 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 after construction 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.129
 case is small for ours 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.750
 place where it will be 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 igorek well basically prince principles 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.760
 some really snowman if available 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.370
 the rain just resting that is exactly 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.949
 this feature so hide based all 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 system so do the substrate set new 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.510
 gadgets called traps levers shouts 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.010
 call it whatever you want call them just 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 that is, they are incapable of a position 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.450
 ours and here we are making a grid so that it can 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 fall out of the snow end of a snowman and not 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 pressed our thread that is so happens 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.189
 he gets on the thread itself its style 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.320
 how to turn on so we put the lattice 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:29.070
 falls falls like this did in such 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.720
 the little thing is just the exclusivity of the delay 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.930
 considerations make you just prettier 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.060
 all this 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.490
 make a big box to a snowman then 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.130
 that did not jump out of the picture and what could 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.410
 tower apologize redeem not reach 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.810
 no way here is our busty hook 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.020
 being mean what about next 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.479
 the warp system here the steelmaker is the simplest 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.360
 command that is from the standard plugin 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.410
 team rushed from each server set 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.090
 warp well let's say let it be again well there 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.130
 snowman again snow is a timer here 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.070
 Estonian torch I 'll just look at 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.709
 just in case there so that here 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.040
 need to put a command block if you 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.520
 You do not know cleaned write in the chat and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.290
 137 you have a command block 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 just for now put it and write in it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.739
 team in 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.380
 weather weather weather sunny sunny 0 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.910
 and the name of your world if you have 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.130
 multi world and there are several worlds like 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.030
 we say well, I'm a creative 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.160
 and so called creative further what's the matter 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.310
 any non-glass substrate 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.590
 materials and able to conduct current 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.980
 we put a delay oder Peter the simplest 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.519
 you can take the rest here style 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.920
 100 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.320
 here put the same whether Peter here 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.080
 stand akira stone and the same guys 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.269
 Here again we put the common unit 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.820
 there first see when the signal 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.130
 if suddenly the snowman died the signal 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.610
 ceed disappears 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.690
 Did our children count the torch here? 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.970
 activates this command block which 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.739
 makes sunny weather signal further 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.260
 the delay with small goes i need 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.260
 to rain could 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.130
 stop and the snow is not dead here goes 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.690
 here and this team could be responsible for 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.340
 the emergence of a new snowman here from 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.709
 unfortunately it could be salt and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.680
 help you sensors but distributors 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.400
 just no eggs such eggs slept if 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.480
 who does not know allows you to call mobs 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 that is, eggs snowman polls exist 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.819
 for this we write a command 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.099
 it could spawn in 5 standard macbook 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.170
 snow man that is snowman 1 that is 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.519
 number 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.790
 interesting thing coordinates 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.450
 ward places ie our created warp 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.230
 warp snow name and 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.459
 through point for 5 5 and the name of the world 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:06.720
 Creative please, that is, if we give 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.370
 put the wool take a button there 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.650
 click on the button we have the idea 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.139
 zaspavnen our snowman and here and so 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.389
 You can put further here lining it 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.820
 so that everything works fine you are watching 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.530
 If we disable including rather have rain 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.349
 us it's a snowman spirit no saddled here a 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 I should say why display the three times 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.560
 in this matter in the chat because we have there 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.660
 already on a spawn there is such a system dispute 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.139
 is far away here and so 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.990
 same system 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.479
 I am here that is you actually have three 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:45.900
 times it works but it's again 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:48.000
 show push even the weather started 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.710
 sun felt so well, you see so 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.690
 we have something that I was talking about 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.570
 proper snowball would appear here and 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.780
 clicked on the thread for this h doing 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.080
 remove the glass here and remove the glass 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.750
 here that is, to our iron 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.849
 iron rods formed such a cross 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.479
 ie not connected netsuke block people 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.820
 then our stitches high fall down then 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.909
 have it made of such considerations 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.620
 now it's over the top we don't know him 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.990
 case of a very useful kobria 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.449
 I regularly use my own 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.110
 my own enjoy become little on 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.800
 spawn 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.330
 we put and by the way our head 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.500
 admin 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.090
 here is the same 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.919
 snowman on with slightly modified 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.680
 under the head size that is vertically 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.190
 just right how was somehow here by 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.780
 vertical to be yours really 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.190
 but in any case up to 10 design 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.230
 will be useful at least on 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.330
 servers it saves from lags 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.700
 Customer is not a server, and the server and 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.590
 customer names meaning players were very 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.500
 Thank you for what actually it is 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.390
 thanks, the idea became us Lesha for what 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.380
 great thank u have in short all 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.380
 thanks for watching goodbye
