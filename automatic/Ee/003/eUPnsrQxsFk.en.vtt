00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.449
 emotions actually happened 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.960

 sat on the press conference serial mix 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.509
 next to them just the same on 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.460
 press conference there was a question about 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.920
 can ivan kochetkov who too 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.100
 represents your company to achieve 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 similar success, he said that everything depends 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 how do you feel inside yourself 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.200
 this is the potential that I said to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.700
 while I think a lot and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.119
 everything will depend on how and what I am 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.880
 will choose if i choose let's say business like 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.960
 I’m having one choice then after 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 Arnold Classic in 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.939
 your feelings as an athlete she 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 somehow changed and what principle 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:47.679
 emotions you experienced after the tournament emotion 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 after she was classics were like good and 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.899
 with experience such as sad because 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.179
 if there were categories under 105 there was 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.709
 prize place and so fell into the category 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.330
 up to 100 that is, there all the guys were 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.140
 heavier than me well, at least a kilogram on 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.479
 5 probably the category was 18 people 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.480
 I don't seem to remember exactly and hit 105 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.140
 principle well and like this arnold 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.099
 classic city ​​rehabilitation simple before 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.489
 more precisely after 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.239
 need disastrous performance on board 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.230
 classic madrid 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.959
 because there was no preparation 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.239
 Now in Russia at 95 kilograms on 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.560
 what stage and how do you clean your 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:38.049
 potential at this competition already 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.430
 Now I keep a diet that is, modes are not 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:45.130
 getting lost acts ate three days by sky 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.520
 a little tired because there are these 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.780
 you are riding a little bit 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.120
 removed outta mode not in general but these days 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.440
 worth it, that is, if you need three more 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.460
 days hold weight keep trying headquarters 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.630
 something that didn't go very high and not 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.080
 strongly flooded with water as a rule 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.940
 just his diet is all that important 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.470
 spoke how everything depends on the main 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 power supply now kai green is favored by many 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.150
 they say that for some 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.720
 this is a special athlete if he is special 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.520
