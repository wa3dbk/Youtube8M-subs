00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
of that so we've got an extra gold rose

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.870 
of that so we've got an extra gold rose
now<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.830> going<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.010> spin<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.580> feeling

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
now I'm going to spin again I'm feeling

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.350 
now I'm going to spin again I'm feeling
lucky<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:47.100> red<00:01:47.280> roses<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> actually

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
lucky the red roses you use to actually

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.790 
lucky the red roses you use to actually
spin<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> thing<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.080> also<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.620> those

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
spin the thing but also to use those

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.300 
spin the thing but also to use those
power<00:01:50.070> ups<00:01:50.190> as<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> say<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.850> way<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.540> way<00:01:51.570> ah

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
power ups as I say no way no way ah

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.040 
power ups as I say no way no way ah
managed<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.490> catch<00:01:53.730> that<00:01:53.760> on<00:01:54.210> video<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.630> am

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
managed to catch that on video I am

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.750 
managed to catch that on video I am
happy<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.890> what<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.610> I'm

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
happy so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.490 
happy so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.970> go<00:01:57.180> ahead<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.420> tap<00:01:57.600> upgrades<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to go ahead and tap upgrades and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680 
going to go ahead and tap upgrades and
these<00:01:59.370> are<00:01:59.520> permanent<00:01:59.880> upgrades<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
these are permanent upgrades so it's

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.510 
these are permanent upgrades so it's
suggesting<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.500> deflation<00:02:02.160> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
suggesting i get deflation and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.070 
suggesting i get deflation and
essentially<00:02:03.330> what<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.570> means<00:02:03.870> is<00:02:04.050> that

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
essentially what that means is that

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.170 
essentially what that means is that
whenever<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:04.980> use<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.370> my<00:02:05.460> power<00:02:05.670> ups<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
whenever I use one of my power ups the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.059 
whenever I use one of my power ups the
cost<00:02:06.390> increases<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.050> can<00:02:07.230> use<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.650> sort<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
cost increases I can use this to sort of

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.849 
cost increases I can use this to sort of
minimize<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.109> no<00:02:10.109> chance<00:02:10.409> am<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.799> to

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:10.859 
minimize that no chance am I going to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.660 
minimize that no chance am I going to
get<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.099> I'm<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> get<00:02:11.640> some<00:02:12.060> more

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
get that I'm going to get some more

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.059 
get that I'm going to get some more
bump<00:02:12.970> damping<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:13.660> costs<00:02:14.170> two<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.920> these

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
bump damping which costs two of these

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.070 
bump damping which costs two of these
which<00:02:15.640> means<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.940> won't<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.209> pushed<00:02:16.420> back<00:02:16.630> quite

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
which means I won't be pushed back quite

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.030 
which means I won't be pushed back quite
as<00:02:17.200> hot<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.470> also<00:02:17.650> I'm<00:02:17.709> going<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.920> get

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
as hot and also I'm going to get

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.130 
as hot and also I'm going to get
finished<00:02:18.430> creeper<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.330> slows<00:02:19.599> down<00:02:19.660> that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
finished creeper so it slows down that

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.630 
finished creeper so it slows down that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
line that caught up to me so I've got

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
line that caught up to me so I've got
longer<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.180> race<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.569> give<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.959> those

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
longer to race and give it to those

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.170 
longer to race and give it to those
actually<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:23.980> are<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:25.060> can

all<00:03:18.010> works<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.510> can<00:03:19.660> see<00:03:19.840> how<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.350> would

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
all works but you can see how it would

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.240 
all works but you can see how it would
get<00:03:21.070> quite<00:03:21.760> chaotic<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.540> quite<00:03:23.290> silly<00:03:23.620> lots

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
