before I was with Helena we did the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.270 
before I was with Helena we did the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280

we saw gosh i think it was about a 10
bushel<00:03:43.650> bump<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.640> then<00:03:45.450> take<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.050> step

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
bushel bump and then take that one step

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.410 
bushel bump and then take that one step
further<00:03:46.380> we've<00:03:46.890> started<00:03:47.190> putting<00:03:47.670> nucleus

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
further we've started putting nucleus

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
further we've started putting nucleus
and<00:03:48.770> we're<00:03:49.770> seeing<00:03:50.100> some<00:03:50.340> pretty<00:03:50.700> good
