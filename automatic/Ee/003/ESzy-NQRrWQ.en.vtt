something that hasn't been done a lot
for<00:00:47.250> mainstream<00:00:47.820> audiences<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.839> we<00:00:48.960> needed<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
for mainstream audiences so we needed to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
for mainstream audiences so we needed to
top<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:50.040> had<00:00:50.160> gone<00:00:50.309> before<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.780> need<00:00:52.019> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
top what had gone before and we need to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.900 
top what had gone before and we need to
get<00:00:52.260> bigger<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.650> badder

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.250 

I<00:00:56.800> was<00:00:57.800> very<00:00:57.950> influenced<00:00:58.550> by<00:00:58.580> anime<00:00:59.450> you<00:01:00.140> know

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
I was very influenced by anime you know

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.130 
I was very influenced by anime you know
mainly<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:01.100> anime<00:01:01.430> of<00:01:01.460> my<00:01:01.700> youth<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.690> sujin

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
mainly the anime of my youth that sujin

mainly the anime of my youth that sujin
28<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:05.080> really<00:01:06.100> assembled<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.160> group<00:01:07.310> of

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
28 I really assembled a group of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.830 
28 I really assembled a group of
designers<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.080> knew<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.350> loved<00:01:09.560> anime<00:01:10.840> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
designers that knew and loved anime the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.140 
designers that knew and loved anime the
only<00:01:12.380> rule<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.620> gave<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> whole<00:01:13.850> crew<00:01:14.090> is

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
only rule I gave to the whole crew is

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.710 
only rule I gave to the whole crew is
that<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:15.110> should<00:01:15.350> never<00:01:15.500> discuss<00:01:15.920> reference

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
that we should never discuss reference

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.360 
that we should never discuss reference
we<00:01:17.720> would<00:01:17.900> respond<00:01:18.410> only<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.920> design<00:01:19.340> of

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
we would respond only to the design of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.910 
we would respond only to the design of
that<00:01:19.700> particular<00:01:20.300> robot<00:01:20.600> within<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
that particular robot within the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.480 
that particular robot within the
universe<00:01:22.370> of<00:01:22.520> Pacific

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.580 

the<00:01:25.790> first<00:01:26.060> step<00:01:26.330> on<00:01:26.480> designing<00:01:26.960> robots<00:01:27.230> was

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
the first step on designing robots was

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.550 
the first step on designing robots was
we<00:01:27.980> did<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:28.370> 40<00:01:28.880> 50<00:01:29.090> silhouettes<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.050> all<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
we did like 40 50 silhouettes of all the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.460 
we did like 40 50 silhouettes of all the
robots<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:32.150> we<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.690> looked<00:01:32.870> at<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.140> cyllage

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.020 
robots and we just looked at the cyllage
and<00:01:33.650> I<00:01:33.740> said<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.160> one's<00:01:34.400> good<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.640> one's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and I said this one's good this one's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.000 
and I said this one's good this one's
good<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.420> one's<00:01:35.660> good<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.260> then<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:36.860> would

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
good this one's good and then we would

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.440 
good this one's good and then we would
grab<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.460> silhouette<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.150> start

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
grab that silhouette and start

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.719 
grab that silhouette and start
developing<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.080> robot<00:01:39.500> gear<00:01:40.160> has<00:01:40.340> been<00:01:40.520> very

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
developing that robot gear has been very

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.969 
developing that robot gear has been very
clear<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.240> he<00:01:41.630> wants<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.050> differentiate<00:01:42.680> all

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
clear that he wants to differentiate all

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.830 
clear that he wants to differentiate all
the<00:01:43.250> jaegers<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:44.270> come<00:01:44.479> up<00:01:44.600> with<00:01:44.780> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the jaegers to come up with a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
the jaegers to come up with a
personality<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.160> an<00:01:46.520> attitude<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.390> each<00:01:47.600> of

creating the mechanical movement we

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.430 
creating the mechanical movement we
reveal<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.920> level<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.850> design<00:03:08.209> only<00:03:08.600> in

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
reveal that level of design only in

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.360 
reveal that level of design only in
