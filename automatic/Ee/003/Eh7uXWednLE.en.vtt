 new York 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.320
 so far 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.539
 Maik 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.029
 I am so sorry 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.709
 we were stupid 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.709
 for nothing to do he is the best 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 a lot of self-confidence 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.029
 when it's wet 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.199
 I do not think so, it's not 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.019
 if I have never heard that 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 these are 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 that is fixed 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 I know where I come from is certainly not so 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.210
 I do not know the program 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 many things needed 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.430
 they separated the discussion 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.560
 Warren estimates the cost healed on the wounds I was anyway 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 reaffirmed their goal is it makes a backlash 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.660
 therefore find 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 I knew, though 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 I would have done better 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.060
 the meeting started it does not change anything 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.060
 I'm going to tell you so now it does not think so 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.359
 actually is 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.789
 how important eight times and that people know this information 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 important to him 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.999
 I do not understand that 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.299
 I do not know who that is 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.999
 her ears 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.569
 Berolina is responsible 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.569
 be read here 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.799
 you can not 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.089
 important role 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.299
 you can not do me 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.299
 I want the girl 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.139
 continue 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.199
 I hope we understand each other 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.569
 Berlin dpa 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.169
 otherwise 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.169
 she was gone 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.999
 Ashley's for a game 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.849
 hor 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 what they are here 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.879
 Staudt 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.439
 other countries 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.129
 despite all frankness said it is important 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.129
 in the local elections 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.749
 it's easier 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.599
 We have to understand that I am only what you get over the years 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.199
 I did not know that anything is not the problem in the 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.469
 March again and again 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.939
 but it is clear that 30 there really is he is one of the forefathers 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.870
 a legend of the first generation of vampires 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.450
 Sofia easy corpse corpse is the Easter bunny compared to Klaus 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.169
 to the side 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.490
 Klaus is the only true tomb known as the oldest 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.080
 if I wanted to understand me correctly so say it is incumbent on the appearance 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.289
 like they never have what they want to say that I mean if that's what they mean 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.330
 Art is the case is this is ACS so I do not want that not the 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
 Case the answer is a solid one 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.940
 Peter is quite right 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.040
 Nobody wants that right-wing extremist NPD anymore 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.760
 Helpful Herrmann I have never met anyone who ever loved him 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.110
 I believe the truth has been over the centuries 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.390
 mixed with mic he might as well be momentum route to history 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.180
 Everything we know, it really exists and it does not give up 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.240
 eQuest decree guests also fear of the zdf documentary dangling shot by Klaus 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.240
 whole mind 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:06.930

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.930
