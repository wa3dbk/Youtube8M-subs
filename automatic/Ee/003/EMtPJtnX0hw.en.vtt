00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 it is time we flew guide london 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 are just as quarreling as easy 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.730
 From this question today the question comes 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 nicole I have currently the earthquake 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.040
 draw a foam on the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.199
 particle suspected that the uv lamp that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.650
 the lamp in my uv lamp 75 watts 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 no longer okay is a new job 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.250
 since then it looks like mine 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.920
 to eat cards or foam 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.619
 my water and oxygen bike with 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.660
 the jbl festmesse are all ok behavior 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 is so far normal to eating 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 Now my question to melanie I want 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 that only really squeezes me 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 the old lie if so, that is generally 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.629
 damaging it thank you so much so do not say so 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 one can post videos i watch them 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.879
 every day and hope there are many more 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 more areas are just that we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.469
 Yours sincerely 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.379
 Nicole sony is the first one 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 really look and produce all the stage produced 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.140
 if you want to know if the cloudiness in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 your water with an algae blossom 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 could be related if they are so always 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 so have a latent water so many 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.060
 Always think when the old brothers deiss 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.890
 There it is such a green soup where you can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
 no two inches can see 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 that is not at all familiar to many 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.180
 Particles there will do the albums would 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 up to 80 90 70 60 percent the old one 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.250
 to force back 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.200
 but not to 100 and then others 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 the typical situation for a half 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 meter, however, perfectly deep in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 he does that because she is out of his 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 practice as no vet we are 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.450
 really one hundred percent fought the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 other then there already are clear 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.229
 but not 100 percent because I can give them 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.960
 promise and there we will still be 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.880
 Often go into it and become one 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 tell how to do it right 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.020
 work on such days at the uv 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 then you get them 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.680
 Particles clear and if you want to know 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.180
 if you are sharing with this one 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.800
 problematic because the algae blooms in the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.820
 very thin concentration also works 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.490
 not really green 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.920
 It can also be so brownish or yellowish 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.500
 but also not big colors at all 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.240
 but would only produce that typical 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.640
 then they look at exactly that 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.390
 foam bubbles because of the foam 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.920
 vesicle 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.690
 they always see that when the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140
 chance and green I would be glad of others 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.910
 page 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 then it has to do with the fact that the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.440
 koi eat that too I already have 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.660
 often seen me only when the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.850
 algal bloom is there but depending on the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.680
 how gluttonous record high theirs 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.060
 stocking density is what we can find 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.160
 Of course, everything exciting up there 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.660
 somehow floats around and foam bubble 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 Of course, from the bottom it looks exactly the same 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.500
 as round as buyer or and then fall 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.239
 So which stop only times it so 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 I explain to myself this effect now 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.570
 but the specific question to melanie yet 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.540
 I think that actually one or 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.100
 really eat the algae bloom if so 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.800
 is that generally harmful 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.120
 no harmful it is nothing like if 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.880
 They are racing on the edge in quotes 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 and because the algae are nibbling so 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.260
 it is not harmful they should 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.970
 of course, that he also knows 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.400
 kept her mother diana 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 Alone food for the youth vitamins 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.080
 and trace elements 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.460
 the seco for your cells and for yours 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.100
 metabolism enough vitamins and 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.100
 have metabolites and that good 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.100
 vonstatten 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.440
 it has more to the ball 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.120
 Of course that is bad but I can 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.860
 they alone promise the statement 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.280
 that only 20 percent of the parts are the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.069
 Melanin experienced her medical practice 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.819
 This is of course balm for the souls 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.950
 desperate owner and finder owner 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.780
 always because they are doing everything wrong 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.849
 but i can promise you it is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.930
 quite quite simply with the plan what 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.030
 if you pay attention to three four parameters 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.709
 We will see him later this year 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.810
 then tell us in winter 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.150
 make and see them 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.890
 Help approach but that was melanie 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.359
 Of course, just said right one 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.250
 the all stupid is not harmful though 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.680
 she does not make a point what in this 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.450
 we need nicole and all 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.450
 to have helped others with it
