water like little ponds or something and
therefore<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.260> retains<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.980> lot<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.280> water

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
therefore it retains a lot of water

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.420 
therefore it retains a lot of water
itself<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:54.260> don't<00:03:54.500> need<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.890> add<00:03:55.070> any

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
itself so you don't need to add any

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.840 
itself so you don't need to add any
water<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.860> will<00:03:58.100> sit<00:03:58.370> will<00:03:58.610> use

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
water to this it as it will sit will use

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.590 
water to this it as it will sit will use
water<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.260> want<00:04:00.500> some<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:02.090> water<00:04:02.300> to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
water and you want some the water to

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.780 
water and you want some the water to
evaporate<00:04:04.120> it's<00:04:05.120> going<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.480> be<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.600> dry<00:04:05.930> dish

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
