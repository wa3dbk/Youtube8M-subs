00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.400
 I'm wilton Vargas from technet and ccoo 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.459
 dotcom you are watching the proband 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.860
 testing of the galaxy s 6 specifically 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.230
 the edge model and we want to tell you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 about four things part of this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 phone that were previously 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.179
 of models that samsung has previously 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.269
 sold or they are new in the galaxy s 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.859
 6 and starting with this list is the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.949
 control area of the curved screen 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 obviously and this being the galaxy s 6 h 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.579
 Well, you will ask yourself if there are any 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 way to have some control time 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.410
 of what happens on the curved screen 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 remember that in the galaxy s 6 is the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 curve is present on both sides of the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.800
 screen not like on the nou earth 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 only on one side to get to this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.870
 new control area let's go here to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 settings and settings are going to search in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 the bottom part until we get 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.379
 here where it says below device 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 screen is on this screen where you go 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.400
 to be able to have access to control what 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.370
 it can or can not be done from 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.390
 the curved screen or as it calls them 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.150
 samsung 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 screen here we can select if 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 we want the lights of the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.010
 sides or the curved part of the screen 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.730
 we also activate a function that 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.580
 call people 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.980
 in which I can assign to certain 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.690
 contacts different colors in such a way 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.100
 that when someone calls me some 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.380
 other contacts calls and the phone is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 upside down then we can then receive 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.760
 that call and know that we are 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.770
 calling with just see the color at 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.290
 which the edge of the screen is being 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 illuminated apart from this other of the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 functions that you have here in this area is 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
 select the notifications that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.780
 we can see on that curved screen and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.850
 finally information screen that are 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.490
 notifications of another type 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.640
 nike what after to have a one 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 watch so that it does not disturb while 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.070
 we are sleeping and finally the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.410
 choose which side we want to interact with 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.909
 with the curved screen if the side 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.340
 left 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.030
 the right side so that when 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.580
 I activate the screen by sliding my finger 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.319
 then the phone can 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.170
 well interpret depending if I am 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.549
 left-handed or if I'm right another of the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.670
 characteristics that are necessary 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.510
 mention in the new galaxy s 6 what is 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.340
 the issue of how this phone continues 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
 and this is maintained from previous models 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.060
 continue to allow you and that we can 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.910
 have access right here under the area of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.519
 mobile network how can we combine 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.940
 different forms of connection so that 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.500
 these allow you to make your speed of 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.170
 connection is faster and that's called 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.079
 download booster and here you can 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.629
 combine what is wifi and lte so that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.610
 simultaneously, it can increase 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.230
 dramatically the connection speed 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.780
 it's good that he only left but 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 Of course this depends on the company 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.109
 of mobile telephony with which you have 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.549
 of services if they allow you to use 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.739
 this function 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.510
 the other thing is the fingerprints the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.819
 fingerprint reader that before 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.790
 it required that you have to slide it 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.040
 in a certain particular direction but 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.569
 now in the galaxy s 6 you can 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 slide it from virtually any 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.920
 address almost all directions and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.420
 will interpret what your footprint is 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.799
 digital and finally something that then 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.260
 changes completely and it is by the design of the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.409
 phone is that it is not waterproof anymore 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.739
 It is not resistant or water proof if 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.239
 you wet it against the s5 if it gets wet 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.480
 going to bathe so you have to have 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.269
 be very careful to remember it because 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.680
 certainly this ability is not 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.750
 integrated into this new model of 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.150
 samsung these are the four things that 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.969
 they were already present or they are new to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.010
 The Samsung Galaxy S 6 on the camera 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.930
 james link and wilton vargas from the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.930
