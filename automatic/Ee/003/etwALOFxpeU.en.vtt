00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.280
 Yes, I thought a little by little, but usually that stupid 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 The number of weekdays is 1200 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.719
 Kameda Univ. 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.999
 I don't have college students 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 16 days until 10 o'clock 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.550
 Look back that it was Yumenoshirushi 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.449
 Nutrition circle just one year in that sense 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.839
 1 year 7 months 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.099
 I think that I was able to 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.099
 People who are forced to reference the area are also s 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.320
 I work hard every day 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.380
 Do something you have to aim for or do something 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.370
 I think that there is a job that can be overlooked 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.420
 Of course the network business is said to be the proof 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.150
 By means 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.500
 There is a reason 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 It is a difficult time in the US market 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.170
 Mine Hayaike in that first network service ass means 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.650
 Being able to receive is a sense of five senses 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.920
 Among them 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.750
 It is actually already Beethoven's which company to choose 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.490
 I think it seems to have become 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.730
 Mr. Iwata thinks that he can play theater 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.570
 When we resolved that we were a lawyer 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.210
 Intuition but 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.340
 I thought I would definitely win 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 I think it will come 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 In fact things or 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 Touching high quality people 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980
 pso I understand from here 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980
 You don't think you're telling me different 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 Canceled in February when there were not enough speakers 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.790
 I made a fruit of the officer 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.050
 Then we continued to deliver about ninety acrobats 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.320
 Without people 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.120
 We create more opportunities and more 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.230
 Do not do it 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.370
 There is such a commander 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.710
 I can expect 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 Of course I want to get my own results 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.460
 Can you do it yourself 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.400
 In line with the public places where fellows can succeed 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.149
 Every week new people 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.539
 I'm late for reporting 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.829
 There was something 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.189
 There was Honda Fried 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.509
 I am very happy 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.379
 Only once after joining the team 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.359
 There is no such happy thing 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.930
 I did not care about the next at this Christmas party 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.659
 It is always required 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 Listen carefully 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.149
 here we go 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.729
 But
