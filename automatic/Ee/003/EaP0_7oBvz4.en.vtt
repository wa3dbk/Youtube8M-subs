00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
know what they put a hole here but I

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.540 
know what they put a hole here but I
think<00:07:02.590> it's<00:07:02.950> so<00:07:03.460> you<00:07:03.520> can<00:07:03.940> um<00:07:04.860> like<00:07:05.860> put<00:07:06.520> it

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
think it's so you can um like put it

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.890 
think it's so you can um like put it
between<00:07:07.260> the<00:07:08.260> mp3<00:07:08.919> and<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:10.120> headphone<00:07:10.630> jack

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900 
between the mp3 and the headphone jack

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.830 
between the mp3 and the headphone jack
so<00:07:11.229> just<00:07:11.950> like<00:07:12.130> keep<00:07:12.640> it<00:07:12.820> loose<00:07:13.030> without

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
so just like keep it loose without

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.460
