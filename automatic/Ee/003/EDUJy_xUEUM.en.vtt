00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.369
 what did the students arrive in class 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.570
 number 5 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.599
 let's talk of average rate average rate a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.520
 buy a support material 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:39.780
 suppose you have a capital if a 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.760
 has a capital c and has a capital c 2 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.260
 other distinguished capital has another 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.489
 capital c3 is another capital c4 and so goes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 onwards 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.580
 several capitals suppose you had 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 each of capital applied to a 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.330
 certain rate and one for the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 capital or the captain hook applied to the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:09.270
 hg and 2 the capital 3 to kill g3 the capital 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.049
 four attash 4 and so on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 and you always make this application 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 during the same period 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.039
 during this period the n periods in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.759
 periods in periods and so will 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:32.429
 all applications will be made in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:44.609
 simple juries all in interest and 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:46.499
 simple with different rates all 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.100
 during the same period 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:54.380
 Someone talks to you because you do not. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.729
 a single application of all this capital 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 at a given rate so that 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.380
 this unique application that even gave 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.929
 income you are having in all 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.619
 these applications 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.770
 sometimes the rate that would give the same income 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.030
 What are you having in all these 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.060
 applications 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.760
 is what we call the average rate 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.890
 then will represent prohibits bar 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.470
 average rate will be the rate that if you 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.660
 apply its entire capital to this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.990
 average rate of the team a deadline had a month 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.390
 income the same simple jury 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.530
 so let's see if you apply if all 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.910
 your capital 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.920
 then you would be applying capital if a 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:50.000
 sooner two but three more short 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.800
 point at that average rate that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.180
 I'll call it ibarra. 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.370
 during the period and hence the yield 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.630
 that all these capitals are 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.210
 separated 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:08.720
 hence the double interest regiment of the first 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:10.700
 application that would be c1 and a times n 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.850
 but the yield of the second application 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.710
 which would be 2 and 2 times n 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.770
 but the understanding of third place 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:28.190
 which would be c3 and three times more 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:32.960
 regiment of the coast application wanted to be 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.400
 four and four times in more dot 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:44.330
 little dots point goes on 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:48.320
 now then I would have if one more if 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.870
 two more sad and more dotty 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.930
 pinch point times the average rate 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.760
 times the term n is equal to you 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.080
 from the right side in all 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.760
 plots appears the n wii is the common term 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.120
 in all plots 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.459
 We can put that evidence there myself. 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.709
 would get its 1 1 and 1 in that parcel 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.790
 putting you in the spotlight you would be 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:25.370
 servers and two that put in 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:29.630
 evidence and would be for 3 and 3 and will 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.850
 tip where the cable car is not observed 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.850
 is that the whole value of n multiplying 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.030
 two sides so I can divide the whole 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.060
 this expression by n means 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:48.670
 He cuts Corey so he would stay on the side. 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:52.480
 left and one more if two more c3 more 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.180
 pontinho bridge a dot times the rate 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.200
 average is the same 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:09.730
 on the right side fixes brasilia 1 and 1 more 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:12.030
 early two and two more c3 and three more 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.040
 pinpoint pinpoint pinpoint pinpoint 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.370
 sometimes these walls are changing 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:25.270
 go seek dividing then you would have 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:34.710
 that the average rate would be a right side 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:40.120
 you would have one and 1 earlier two and two 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:43.750
 more and three and three more dot 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.820
 A little dot down on this face that 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:51.520
 is multiplying going cultural divided 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:55.980
 I would be / but one and two if more and 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.650
 three more dot continuous dot of 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.830
 this would be the rate that the same 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.890
 income that is giving those 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.460
 all applications if you apply 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:13.780
 made the capital during the same period 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:18.280
 this rate this is the call rate rate 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.640
 average is this and the average interest rate 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.080
 simple is this the average interest rate 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.080
 simple average rate 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.139
 then average rate in reality you are 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.870
 for what is an arithmetic mean 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:41.930
 weighted average 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.970
 today the countries are the capital repairs 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.440
 which are multiplying by being one of the 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.169
 2003 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.860
 below you have the sum of these capitals 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:55.430
 the sum of these floors takes average rate is 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.270
 a weighted average of the rates with 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:03.880
 expenditures are the capital of the 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.880
 let's see an example of this 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.650
 ae
