00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.490 

now<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:14.090> everything<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.630> set<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:14.960> it's<00:02:15.290> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
now that everything is set up it's a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.350 
now that everything is set up it's a
matter<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.830> positioning<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.670> camera<00:02:17.150> and

matter of positioning your camera and
external<00:02:17.900> flash<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.010> flash<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.580> read<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
external flash so the flash can read the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.690 
external flash so the flash can read the
signal<00:02:20.300> from<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.630> camera<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.550> wouldn't<00:02:22.550> want

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
signal from the camera you wouldn't want

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.220

to<00:02:22.760> place<00:02:22.970> them<00:02:23.150> side<00:02:23.390> by<00:02:23.420> side<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.690> hope

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
to place them side by side so I hope

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.800
