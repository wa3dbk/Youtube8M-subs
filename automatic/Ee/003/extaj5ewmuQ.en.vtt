00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.190 
device ok so it is a very original
design<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.700> curved<00:02:09.119> rectangle<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
design it's a curved rectangle as you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.869 
design it's a curved rectangle as you
can<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.979> may<00:02:11.310> seem<00:02:11.670> pretty

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
can see it may seem pretty

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.330 
can see it may seem pretty
straightforward<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
straightforward but it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.630 
straightforward but it
very<00:02:14.060> very<00:02:14.300> curved<00:02:14.860> pretty<00:02:15.860> original<00:02:16.400> form

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
very very curved pretty original form

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.100 
very very curved pretty original form
factor<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.209> let's<00:02:17.239> start<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.840> has<00:02:21.080> a
