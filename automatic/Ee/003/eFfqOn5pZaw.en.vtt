00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.240
 hello to all and manu this new episode 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.750
 of the dofus book series in his 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 inventory 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.400
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.369
 new exo story to have 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.500
 still more today we will try 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.320
 to make a sword gordon invocations 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.730
 so and then that I just kraft the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.290
 craft is expensive 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.150
 apart from the pebbles is nothing so we're going 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.809
 try to make a summon on 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.510
 I will put 290 vitality 45 wisdom 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.710
 stop doing eight I know I 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.340
 no need of the eight the pp I have nothing to 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 do limit I put to four hundred 400 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.079
 I think I do not know 450 I'll see this 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.899
 dog for the tents then said to 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.870
 key mean one say everything and this 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.660
 everywhere for six hours so that's 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.890
 will try to do that and we end up 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.880
 when it's happening just now we see 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 that they like to see together that 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.130
 gives a classic winding of shovels 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.140
 people so we will try to do the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.700
 What I said earlier is 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.119
 ironed critics and a few rounds 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.450
 so basically the bear countries did 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:32.509
 yoyo between all 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.509
 a first fire 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.079
 so the point is that it can 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.060
 in the pp I did that and if that 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.340
 can not it's a little shit 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.369
 otherwise the game is pretty weak for 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.710
 that it goes by without its employees 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.140
 just like that by chaining them 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.259
 critical hits on the runes have finished 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.159
 by having I asked I like to be a 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.369
 delighted if I have an over speed on the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.899
 example work even more cool as I 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.399
 do it on the archetype and on the grid 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.769
 at crown but good on people 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.769
 it's a bit more complicated in my opinion 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.549
 because precisely there is not since 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.480
 when we make empty beer tents a 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.370
 often because we have a well 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.959
 so here I have a very correct journey 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.239
 is a good initiative in touch is 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.900
 an excellent nugget so I hope that 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.150
 it goes on it does not pass you 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.470
 see when you make examples your 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.530
 skis exhausted is not really huge 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.340
 that I put a little bit of tacler by my 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.200
 notice i'll quickly chained the tents to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.400
 julien such as find 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 I soon in China and let's start 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.600
 should go pretty fast there our 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.270
 fear that I had passed a vosges 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.330
 issued 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.230
 an hour to make 60 attempts 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.670
 it really went very fast for the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.610
 blow this is a small s activate success 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.390
 critical critical strike 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.120
 so I spent 1 2 3 4 5 6 he me 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.410
 remains so 18 since I do not know just a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.800
 little rotten to go a success 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 critical 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840
 so I still have enough rotten life that 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.590
 go on and I can put one in it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.710
 pass not damage good will to all 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.710
 time 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:34.270
 oh fuck his mother the bitch i put the street 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.800
 dwarf wants that's less a ccg than a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.610
 line I made myself it's the party 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.650
 and right now huh I thought 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.600
 mormeck at bale a really really iron 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.820
 so you said 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:13.290
 and that's what's fucked 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:23.330
 it's the only giant 298 that I 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:30.050
 wish way 285 it's okay it's believable 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:34.830
 oh well it's done 21h01 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.030
 Okay, so here's my pdp that ends up 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.190
