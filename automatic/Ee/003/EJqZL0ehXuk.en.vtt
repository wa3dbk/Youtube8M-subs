00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.539 
in an applied energistics tune so today
I<00:00:11.880> thought<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.450> might<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.590> well<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:14.040> show

automate some of the basic things in
applied<00:00:23.010> energistics<00:00:23.660> with<00:00:24.660> using<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.170> few

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
applied energistics with using as few

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.359 
applied energistics with using as few
channels<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.099> possible<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.070> what

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
channels as possible so that's what

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
channels as possible so that's what
we're<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.480> today<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.140> made<00:00:33.350> some

using<00:00:48.260> six<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> eight<00:00:49.559> channels<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:51.140> also

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
using six of eight channels here I also

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.639 
using six of eight channels here I also
have<00:00:52.289> an<00:00:53.180> enemy<00:00:54.180> controller<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.500> need

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have an enemy controller because we need

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.939 
have an enemy controller because we need
to<00:00:55.860> use<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.610> than<00:00:56.670> eight<00:00:56.969> channels<00:01:00.949> alright

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to use more than eight channels alright

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
to use more than eight channels alright
so<00:01:02.730> basically<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
do today is automating the fluids

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550 
do today is automating the fluids
crystals<00:01:08.540> which<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.689> also<00:01:09.840> saw<00:01:10.229> many<00:01:10.500> people

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
crystals which I also saw many people

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
crystals which I also saw many people
complaining<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.960> forums<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.810> yeah

let's get to it I'm going to use one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.820 
let's get to it I'm going to use one
channel<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:20.310> automate<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> today<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> it's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
channel to automate this today and it's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
channel to automate this today and it's
really<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.000> complicated<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:25.110> pretty

cable<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.619> made<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
cable do this thing I made here and this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
cable do this thing I made here and this
is<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> keep<00:01:36.329> track<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> our<00:01:36.990> channels<00:01:37.829> all

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
is to keep track of our channels all

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.029 
is to keep track of our channels all
right

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
right

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.679 
right
okay<00:01:42.289> so<00:01:43.490> we'd<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> put<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.180> an

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
okay so we'd like to put down an

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.039 
okay so we'd like to put down an
interface<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:47.179> with<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.210> chest<00:01:48.539> next<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
interface here with a chest next to it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
interface here with a chest next to it
and<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.210> interface<00:01:52.850> we're<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.179> put

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and in this interface we're going to put

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.760 
and in this interface we're going to put
the<00:01:55.079> necessary<00:01:55.649> ingredients<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> pattern

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the necessary ingredients in a pattern

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:07.929 
the necessary ingredients in a pattern
let's<00:01:58.770> see

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.350 

we<00:02:08.509> have<00:02:08.629> some<00:02:08.780> blank<00:02:09.080> patterns<00:02:10.360> pattern

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
we have some blank patterns pattern

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.220 
we have some blank patterns pattern
terminal<00:02:12.730> let's<00:02:13.730> take<00:02:14.030> better<00:02:19.180> synchronized

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
alright so at the moment we're using one

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.410 
alright so at the moment we're using one
channel<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:19.230> line<00:03:19.860> that's<00:03:20.640> all<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.270> to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
channel this line that's all we going to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.199 
channel this line that's all we going to
use<00:03:21.600> basically<00:03:24.050> okay<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.430> scrapped<00:03:26.430> self

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.540 
use basically okay I scrapped self
transfer<00:03:27.690> nodes<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:34.769> let's<00:03:35.190> put<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.489> some

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
transfer nodes and and let's put in some

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.630 
transfer nodes and and let's put in some
speed<00:03:36.030> upgrades<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.250> speed<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.430> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
speed upgrades just to speed up the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.290 
speed upgrades just to speed up the
process<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:40.130> now<00:03:41.130> we're<00:03:41.580> going<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.820> make<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
process here now we're going to make a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.589 
process here now we're going to make a
drop<00:03:42.660> from<00:03:43.250> yeah<00:03:44.250> minecraft<00:03:45.050> basic

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:04:05.180 

right<00:03:49.599> there<00:03:51.569> put<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.659> redstone

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.309 

perfect<00:04:06.190> okay<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:08.260> next<00:04:08.470> step<00:04:09.959> make<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.140> some

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
perfect okay the next step make you some

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:24.440 
perfect okay the next step make you some
gloss<00:04:13.859> sorry<00:04:14.950> that's<00:04:15.579> for<00:04:15.819> afterwards

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.420 

then<00:04:25.050> we're<00:04:25.890> going<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:27.170> chest<00:04:28.190> all<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.220> way

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
then we're going to chest all the way

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.510 
then we're going to chest all the way
down<00:04:29.790> here<00:04:30.350> one<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.470> these<00:04:31.590> filtering<00:04:32.160> helpers

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
down here one of these filtering helpers

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.540 
down here one of these filtering helpers
from<00:04:32.760> before<00:04:33.300> we<00:04:33.660> find<00:04:34.500> relocation<00:04:35.400> which

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
from before we find relocation which

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.520 
from before we find relocation which
you're<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.970> need<00:04:36.210> at<00:04:37.020> least<00:04:37.260> for<00:04:37.410> this

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
you're going to need at least for this

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.300 
you're going to need at least for this
setup<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.010> can<00:04:38.220> do<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:39.360> other<00:04:39.480> ways<00:04:39.720> but

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
setup you can do it in other ways but

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.410 
setup you can do it in other ways but
this<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.460> how<00:04:41.610> I'm<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.030> do<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.300> here

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
this is how I'm going to do it here

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.360 
this is how I'm going to do it here
today

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
today

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:52.120 
today
then<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:44.550> need

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.230 

now<00:04:52.760> we're<00:04:52.880> going<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.090> set<00:04:53.390> up<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:55.730> filtering

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
now we're going to set up the filtering

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.690 
now we're going to set up the filtering
hopper<00:04:56.540> do<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.350> only<00:04:57.530> accept<00:04:58.130> clicks<00:04:58.970> crystal

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
hopper do you only accept clicks crystal

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.200 
hopper do you only accept clicks crystal
right<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.330> if<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.140> put<00:05:03.760> one<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.850> those<00:05:05.030> down

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
right so if I put one of those down

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.740 
right so if I put one of those down
there<00:05:06.190> won't<00:05:07.190> go<00:05:08.180> into<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.540> hopper<00:05:09.730> but

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.820 

so<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.320> crystal<00:05:13.910> in<00:05:14.910> there<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:16.320> should<00:05:16.380> go

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
so a crystal in there it should go

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.130 
so a crystal in there it should go
straight<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.870> right

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
straight in right

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.290 
straight in right
I<00:05:19.170> named<00:05:20.100> three<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.580> below<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:22.310> so<00:05:23.310> we<00:05:24.180> have

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
I named three just below it so we have

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.880 
I named three just below it so we have
to<00:05:24.480> go<00:05:24.690> in<00:05:25.590> here<00:05:26.570> grab<00:05:27.570> myself<00:05:27.690> I'm<00:05:28.590> not<00:05:28.830> a

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
to go in here grab myself I'm not a

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:41.070 
to go in here grab myself I'm not a
transfer<00:05:29.340> mode<00:05:30.260> some<00:05:31.260> transfer<00:05:31.740> pipes

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.159 

and<00:05:41.319> it's<00:05:42.039> going<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.430> go<00:05:42.699> back<00:05:43.419> up

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
and it's going to go back up

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.820 
and it's going to go back up
it's<00:05:45.439> our<00:05:45.650> interface

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.379 

simple<00:05:49.639> as<00:05:49.759> that<00:05:50.110> right<00:05:51.310> so<00:05:52.310> let's<00:05:52.490> just<00:05:52.819> this

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
simple as that right so let's just this

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.710 
simple as that right so let's just this
guy<00:05:53.660> up<00:05:53.900> I'm<00:05:54.110> going<00:05:54.259> to<00:05:54.349> make<00:05:54.500> a<00:05:54.530> wireless<00:05:55.720> and

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
guy up I'm going to make a wireless and

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.600 
guy up I'm going to make a wireless and
he<00:05:56.949> just<00:05:58.569> what's<00:05:59.569> going<00:05:59.780> on<00:06:00.129> wireless

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.749 

terminal<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:05.030> we<00:06:05.389> need<00:06:05.509> to<00:06:05.599> link<00:06:05.840> it<00:06:05.960> up

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
terminal and we need to link it up

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:20.589 
terminal and we need to link it up
security<00:06:07.759> terminal

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.280 

okay

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.070 

now<00:06:24.160> we<00:06:24.220> should<00:06:24.520> have<00:06:24.550> all<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.390> materials

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
now we should have all the materials

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.050 
now we should have all the materials
needed

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.620 

wait<00:06:30.480> a<00:06:30.510> sec<00:06:31.100> yeah<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:33.560> need<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.620> trim<00:06:35.630> Sivir

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
wait a sec yeah I need to trim Sivir

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:55.790 
wait a sec yeah I need to trim Sivir
trance

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.490 

so<00:06:56.699> now<00:06:57.650> we<00:06:58.650> should<00:06:58.889> be<00:06:59.129> able<00:06:59.370> to<00:06:59.520> cross<00:06:59.789> craft

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
so now we should be able to cross craft

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:09.560 
so now we should be able to cross craft
looks<00:07:01.500> crystals

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.970 

it's<00:07:10.020> made<00:07:10.230> into<00:07:10.410> Forex<00:07:11.720> crystal<00:07:12.720> and<00:07:12.980> it

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
it's made into Forex crystal and it

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.750 
it's made into Forex crystal and it
should<00:07:14.220> be<00:07:14.430> back<00:07:14.670> in<00:07:14.970> our<00:07:15.240> system<00:07:16.460> that's<00:07:17.460> it

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:17.760 
should be back in our system that's it

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.129 
should be back in our system that's it
passes<00:07:18.330> into<00:07:18.600> the<00:07:18.690> interface<00:07:18.930> again

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:28.260 

there<00:07:23.770> we<00:07:23.889> go<00:07:24.599> simple<00:07:25.620> very<00:07:26.620> simple<00:07:26.999> let's<00:07:27.999> try

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
there we go simple very simple let's try

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.480 
there we go simple very simple let's try
it<00:07:28.330> again

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
it again

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.239 
it again
derp<00:07:30.490> it<00:07:30.669> up<00:07:30.789> this<00:07:30.999> time<00:07:31.680> items<00:07:32.680> come<00:07:32.919> out<00:07:33.069> of

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:33.249 
derp it up this time items come out of

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:36.300 
derp it up this time items come out of
the<00:07:33.370> dropper<00:07:34.259> goes<00:07:35.259> into<00:07:35.770> that<00:07:35.949> flakes

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
the dropper goes into that flakes

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:42.140 
the dropper goes into that flakes
crystal<00:07:36.789> and<00:07:37.479> it<00:07:38.229> goes

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.930 

pipe<00:07:42.860> transfer<00:07:43.860> pipe

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 
pipe transfer pipe

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.840 
pipe transfer pipe
and

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:46.850 
and

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.010 
and
should<00:07:47.450> see<00:07:47.750> passing<00:07:48.170> by

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.020 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.890 

okay<00:07:54.020> I<00:07:54.230> hope<00:07:54.890> this<00:07:55.210> helped<00:07:56.210> a<00:07:56.270> few<00:07:56.420> people<00:07:56.480> and

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900 
okay I hope this helped a few people and

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.270 
okay I hope this helped a few people and
just<00:07:57.020> by<00:07:57.320> the<00:07:57.350> way<00:07:57.470> I'm<00:07:57.590> just<00:07:57.830> going<00:07:58.070> to<00:07:58.100> show

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280 
just by the way I'm just going to show

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.870 
just by the way I'm just going to show
you<00:07:58.780> that<00:07:59.780> this<00:07:59.930> all<00:08:00.200> uses<00:08:00.650> one<00:08:00.920> channel<00:08:01.310> so<00:08:01.640> I

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:01.880 
you that this all uses one channel so I

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.230 
you that this all uses one channel so I
could<00:08:02.240> basically<00:08:02.630> make<00:08:03.140> eight<00:08:03.800> of<00:08:03.860> these<00:08:04.240> on

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 
could basically make eight of these on

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.330 
could basically make eight of these on
the<00:08:06.200> same<00:08:06.410> cable<00:08:07.870> so<00:08:08.870> if<00:08:09.530> you<00:08:09.620> use<00:08:09.800> other<00:08:10.010> moths

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:10.340 
the same cable so if you use other moths

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.540 
the same cable so if you use other moths
the<00:08:11.000> channels<00:08:11.450> are<00:08:11.810> really<00:08:12.290> not<00:08:12.500> a<00:08:12.800> problem

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.550 
the channels are really not a problem

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.990 
the channels are really not a problem
okay<00:08:14.480> bye
