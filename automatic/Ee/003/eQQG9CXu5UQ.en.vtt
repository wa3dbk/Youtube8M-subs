00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
anything special planned for that but

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.950 
anything special planned for that but
yeah<00:00:29.240> anyways<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.840> have

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
yeah anyways I don't really think I have

at<00:00:51.030> my<00:00:51.180> opponents<00:00:51.750> side<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> field<00:00:52.110> he

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
at my opponents side of the field he

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.010 
at my opponents side of the field he
also<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.489> offensive<00:00:53.910> team<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
also has an offensive team with a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
also has an offensive team with a
Kangaskhan<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.550> biggest

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Kangaskhan which is actually the biggest

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.939 
Kangaskhan which is actually the biggest
threat<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.390> his<00:00:57.570> team<00:00:57.809> which<00:00:58.320> means<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.739> lose

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
threat on his team which means if I lose

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.590 
threat on his team which means if I lose
out<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> mola<00:00:59.550> that<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.420> could

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
out on the mola that thing could

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060 
out on the mola that thing could
potentially<00:01:01.079> right<00:01:01.289> through<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.620> team<00:01:01.859> but

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
potentially right through my team but

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650 
potentially right through my team but
his<00:01:02.250> team<00:01:02.460> also<00:01:02.670> seems<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.270> based<00:01:03.449> around

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
his team also seems to be based around

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
his team also seems to be based around
entry<00:01:04.080> hazards<00:01:04.379> luckily<00:01:04.739> though<00:01:04.920> he<00:01:05.400> doesn't

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
entry hazards luckily though he doesn't

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.219 
entry hazards luckily though he doesn't
have<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> rapid<00:01:06.180> spinner<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> spin<00:01:06.990> blocker

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
have a rapid spinner or a spin blocker

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
have a rapid spinner or a spin blocker
which<00:01:07.439> means<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.250> hopefully<00:01:08.460> spin<00:01:08.850> away

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
which means I can hopefully spin away

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
which means I can hopefully spin away
his<00:01:09.210> hazards<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.689> he<00:01:09.780> gets<00:01:09.960> them<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> while<00:01:10.740> my

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
his hazards if he gets them up while my

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.440 
his hazards if he gets them up while my
hazards<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> stay<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
hazards will be here to stay so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
hazards will be here to stay so
expecting<00:01:13.229> him<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> lead<00:01:13.590> off<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> garba

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
expecting him to lead off with the garba

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.710 
expecting him to lead off with the garba
door<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.610> decided<00:01:15.030> lead<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.420> my<00:01:15.509> choice

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
door I decided lead off on my choice

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.149 
door I decided lead off on my choice
band<00:01:15.960> Golic<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.680> leads<00:01:17.009> off

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
band Golic but he actually leads off

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
band Golic but he actually leads off
with<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> Kangaskhan<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.720> him

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
with the Kangaskhan now I know the him

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
with the Kangaskhan now I know the him
more<00:01:19.020> likely<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> fake

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
more likely it is gonna go for the fake

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.160 
more likely it is gonna go for the fake
out<00:01:20.909> due<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> fact<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.049> about

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
out due to the fact that just about

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
out due to the fact that just about
