00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 Andrei Klimov this Saturday will be 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.480
 pedros kamenets 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 today is the last day of preparation 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.890
 final preparations are leaving tomorrow 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.649
 how would you prepare for everything you feel 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.430

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 went according to plan 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 scheduled sparring number then 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 there is a successful job well who was sleeping 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.129
 near Kiev Miguel works great until the morning you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.899
 Petros surely studied well just 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 say what you think about him and what 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 impression you have no xiii boxers 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 also from the working distance 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 there is a working on the floors you're out of your head in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 general boxer with no sleep experience and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 fight bills and then miscalculates 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.350
 the sea then finds errors and cattails 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.290
 I have some sort of body 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.620
 special tactics or not yet 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.770
 thought in this the groundwork was and 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.750
 everything can such a pattern on this 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.870
 everything can get stuck awkwardly 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 it is convenient for someone to change box with 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.890
 one rival among me is possible each 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.530
 certain opponent is boxing by 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.900
 his opponents seem to not fit 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.540
 there with more getting with another plays 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.550

 will box that is understandable to us and 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.069
 Andrei had a great human received 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.569
 will be 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:56.530
 fighting endurance characters and 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.810
 stiffness is our task to plant it on 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.660
 heels and aggressively work first 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.180
 and work at a pace in which Andrei 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.580
 can withstand 12 rounds 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.580
 no problem i think this 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.180
 stamina yes go all sweat and go 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.660
 him most effective if she 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.700
 He might be able to finish more we 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.780
 pleasure we will be glad of it 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.919
 Naturally already adjusted to the whole 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.410
 battle and endurance and speed blame 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.910
 endurance 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.330
 makes boxing wonders we want like the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.330

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:45.869
 check his heart what it is 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:48.229
 big what is Andrea a big question 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.229
 such 

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:55.619
 we don't know we watched a lot andrew 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:57.719
 watched all inspected worked out 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:01.639
 strategy will stick with her 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.779
 plan and try to implement it 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.009
 Opponent well studied all amicably 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:12.269
 Is it natural but Andrei is such a boxer 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:17.819
 who likes to see everything in the ring because 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:19.579
 which is very often my old boxers 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.589
 coming up with new tricks 

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.719
 new tricks the water for him is just 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.389
 ok he won't rush we don't 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.969
 We will frantically jump out trying to him 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.799
 take down head 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:34.279
 let's look at his fireman 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:35.989
 let's move and start to work unpleasant 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.849
 the position to burn here is it normal 

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:41.899
 position method first very first 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.759
 worried then saw who riga 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:49.509
 crawford and who lost and became yes 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.030
 because agam black 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.669
 many many who lay yes the same ray 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.260
 beltran can't do anything he 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.540
 simply 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:04.730
 unique boxers very, very he 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.990
 gorgeous school reflexes crazy 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:11.090
 speed of knowledge he is a unique boxer of us 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.750
 and this is not a shame to lose 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:19.960
 attack so and this is like 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:25.910
 Andrei gave confidence because 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.760
 almost 99 percent decent 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.620
 there was no sometimes she single 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.250
 knockdown was not wanted he beats very 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.850
 strong 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.040
 and the tiniest admitted that he was 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.040
 not easy and manager up 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.300
 manager cameron dancan said it was 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.300
 hard fight we unexpectedly 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.330
 already
