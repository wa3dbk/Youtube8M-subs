00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.830

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.370
 the mind 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.500
 after when you throw you throw everything 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.199

 that's enough to see how to learn to calliÃ¨re 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:26.329
 word of mouth that strengthens the fort 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 is that of the reflex cases there she assured 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.730

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.120

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.989
 when you realized the ear 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.700
 it's very good pressure but even 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.900
 time you took it back and all very well 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.810
