ghostbusters 3 are sort of like

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
ghostbusters 3 are sort of like
Ghostbusters<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.550> ghostbusters<00:00:38.550> 2<00:00:39.000> but

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
Ghostbusters and ghostbusters 2 but

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
Ghostbusters and ghostbusters 2 but
pretty<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.410> Ghostbusters<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> original

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
pretty much Ghostbusters the original

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
pretty much Ghostbusters the original
it's<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.829> hard<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.820> make

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's going to be really hard to make

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
it's going to be really hard to make
another<00:00:46.760> Ghostbusters<00:00:47.760> movie<00:00:47.789> ghostbusters

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
3 and make it any good I think it's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.040 
3 and make it any good I think it's
gonna<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.570> hard<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> do

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050

hiring<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.600> new<00:01:48.810> actors<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.860> kind

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
hiring you know new actors and that kind

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.969 
hiring you know new actors and that kind
of<00:01:50.100> stuff<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:51.299> probably<00:01:51.770> now<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> i

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
of stuff in I think probably now that i

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.550 
of stuff in I think probably now that i
think<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.189> actually<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.360> depends<00:01:55.259> who<00:01:55.409> they

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
think about actually it depends who they

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.310 
think about actually it depends who they
get<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.270> somebody<00:01:57.780> who

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
get you know if they get somebody who
like<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:59.130> good<00:01:59.310> writer<00:01:59.579> who's<00:01:59.820> really

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
like a really good writer who's really

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
like a really good writer who's really
funny<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.930> write<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.409> script

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
Jim Carrey but now that would work he's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.970 
Jim Carrey but now that would work he's
too<00:02:17.820> old<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.120> anyway<00:02:18.660> uh<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
too old now to anyway uh but just you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.470 
too old now to anyway uh but just you
know<00:02:20.070> get<00:02:20.220> somebody<00:02:20.520> really<00:02:20.730> funny<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.270> there

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
know get somebody really funny in there

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320 
know get somebody really funny in there
I<00:02:22.100> maybe<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.310> actually<00:02:23.700> could<00:02:23.910> work<00:02:24.090> but<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
I maybe it actually could work but I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.490 
I maybe it actually could work but I
don't<00:02:24.600> know<00:02:24.660> it's<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.410> those

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
don't know it's just it's one of those

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
don't know it's just it's one of those
things<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.370> lot<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.330> times<00:02:27.570> when

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
things I think it's a lot of times when

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.660 
things I think it's a lot of times when
it<00:02:27.930> when<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> studio<00:02:28.500> sets<00:02:28.770> out<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> sequel

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
it when a studio sets out to do a sequel

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
it when a studio sets out to do a sequel
for<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> purpose<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.690> doing<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.230> sequel

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
for the purpose of just doing a sequel

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
for the purpose of just doing a sequel
it<00:02:32.400> ends<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.760> being<00:02:32.790> crap<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.660> they

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
it ends up being crap you know if they

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.240 
it ends up being crap you know if they
don't<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.260> idea<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> good<00:02:35.100> direction

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
don't have an idea for a good direction

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.949 
don't have an idea for a good direction
of<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> story<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.209> want<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.510> go<00:02:36.690> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
of the story that they want to go and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.290 
of the story that they want to go and
they<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.590> want<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.100> make<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.459> because<00:02:38.850> there

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
they just want to make it because there

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030 
they just want to make it because there
is<00:02:39.510> been<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.870> long<00:02:40.050> since<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.380> other<00:02:40.500> two<00:02:40.740> came

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
is been so long since the other two came

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.980 
is been so long since the other two came
out<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.580> all<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.180> stuff<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.660> most<00:02:42.870> people

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
out and all that stuff and most people

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.090 
out and all that stuff and most people
don't<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.560> ghostbusters<00:02:44.160> 2<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:45.709> don't<00:02:46.709> mind

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.010 
don't like ghostbusters 2 I don't mind
it<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.610> definitely<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> does<00:02:48.239> not<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
it but definitely it does not have the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.380 
it but definitely it does not have the
magic<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> first<00:02:49.860> one<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.370> lot<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> seems

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
magic of the first one a lot of it seems

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.510 
magic of the first one a lot of it seems
a<00:02:51.660> little<00:02:51.690> bit<00:02:52.110> repetitive<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.370> lot<00:02:53.489> of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
a little bit repetitive and a lot of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.690 
a little bit repetitive and a lot of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
think it could work but it really

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
think it could work but it really
depends<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.130> who<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.549> choose<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.180> know<00:03:18.420> to

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
capture that fun factor and they really

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.040 
capture that fun factor and they really
were<00:04:36.270> able<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.539> do<00:04:36.599> with<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.840> first
