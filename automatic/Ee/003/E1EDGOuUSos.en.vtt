00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 I want you to greet me seriously 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.629
 thanks for being here again my 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.510
 channel and this day so I have returned with a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 gameplay sir it's true that I had 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 time not to upload a gameplay and good 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.020
 I think this was the day that touched me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 I came here to the mixtepec studios 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.470
 so good the ink with the account 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.029
 him to see how he had told them I do not have 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 capturing the town is costing 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.090
 right now I'm setting up my studio 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 because number one because they are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.410
 asking for videogame stuff like that and it's 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.610
 why I want to explain to you gentlemen 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.460
 is that I just moved to a house this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.070
 I do not have all the all things are 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.129
 ready to start recording so no 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 I have been able to degrade gameplay or 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.570
 things so what do you like to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 gamers but soon very soon and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.260
 in a couple of weeks I'll be 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 arranging what is the study that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 mingo again to be able to be 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 making life so I hope and they have me 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.900
 patience 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.910
 I will be uploading the net with hector 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.260
 answering silly questions always 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.860
 because you are participating in the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.940
 channel and I feel that you are 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.850
 supporting me I will continue doing 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.130
 videos because I like doing it necessary 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.729
 in months three already know that I do not live of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 this but it's like a young man so 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.960
 well let's talk a little bit about 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.200
 I play this call of duty 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.120
 the truth that I liked a lot I liked it 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.080
 much 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.610
 I've played a few hours already 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.320
 because I already have my playstation 4 already 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.700
 I was playing totally that I want 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.659
 is playing of mine 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 here I am playing with a help 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.369
 in my story I already got the hell 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.409
 but here I am playing with obsidian 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.590
 and this extended chargers 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.590
 and I also have the name 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.359
 to silenced the post also 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.240
 the truth can tell you that it is very 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.009
 happy with the game at the beginning I do not 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.319
 I liked that in the sex movements 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.929
 because I felt it was something very different 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.590
 to us now what we 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.849
 we wanted to make good light to the old 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.280
 like me that we are used to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.610
 play whites and all that kind of games 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.190
 for me it was a big change but 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.250
 Now this one that I'm used to 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.239
 I think it's going to be harder for me 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.099
 get used to new games that 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.079
 also give in whites that also do not 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.030
 again they are movements so 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.250
 let's hope that at least it looks like a 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.819
 little bit out there well trader and it seems to be 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.980
 that jump too you have to wait I'm going to 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.140
 study the suit whose versions there was a 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.569
 explanation or what I understand of what 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.730
 which is the trailer and it looks very good 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.900
 he has also never agreed with 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.510
 the futuristic games never 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.760
 I do not know but in this case, I've passed 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 a lot of time entertained and it has made me 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.019
 to send this online game to play 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.030
 I'm not good because I'm not good at playing 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.310
 I do what I can 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.740
 and as always I have never always 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.470
 said on my channel is not for that 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.360
 learn to play or nothing by study is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.790
 so you can watch the games and 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.829
 talk and we think they give a while 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.120
 before when I relived it will be for 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.980
 than you before buying games 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.629
 could see the review and already in very 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.689
 little as I tell you that when you have the 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.480
 fracture dora I will have this reviews 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.980
 in the channel for at least 1 week 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.450
 I do not know what you think about the games that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.700
 I have not done reviews although I do not 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.140
 They are new but they are old because I was 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.409
 out of the channel I do not know if you guys 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.629
 would like to see these reviews although they are already 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.370
 maybe old games have also passed 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.170
 a good six months or seven months 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.189
 then looking here in the box 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.349
 comments 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.959
 be here quickie making an example 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.879
 and small no big thing like other 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.790
 people that your video here on youtube 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.980
 that are really exaggerated to play 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.250
 these games I think this is a talent 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.680
 which I do not have it here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.819
 could hairy than a fierce 2 but not 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.640
 they think he always got it out that was south 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.670
 as well as come here 3 once was something 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.950
 as surprise judges this has 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.120
 come out several times but it's not that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.400
 always do 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.109
 and I said this time because it was not 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.449
 wanting to upload a gameplay because not 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.380
 raise them this that at least was not 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.449

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.510

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.460
 I wanted to make this video for 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.470
 explain to all these people that 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.479
 leave me in the comments that happened 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.669
 to the channel with the gaming that from the 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.500
 blog I ask a little patience 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.440
 because we have all human beings 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.889
 we have personal problems and therefore 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.600
 I have been able to fix my office well 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.430
 to fix the room of 9 because I'm going 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.370
 to be a dad for those who do not follow me 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.740
 facebook is out there I was commenting 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.150
 what not in all my videos out there 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.490
 I was also commenting that I'm going to be 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.949
 dad within very little this then 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.250
 this the truth that has been a bit 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:12.240
 busy and with the business itself that 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.620
 I have also good we won 156 to 145 yo 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.780
 with that I'm going to say goodbye 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.360
 patience that many games are coming 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.850
 and we also had the last death as 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.349
 You can see with the same drop I say goodbye
