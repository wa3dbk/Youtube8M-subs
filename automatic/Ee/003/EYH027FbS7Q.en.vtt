00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.340
 I wanted to ask about yesterday's game against 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.049
 mvp 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 you will have no special with them 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.890
 problems on the first day but did you become 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.590
 somehow more serious about them 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.440
 after they knocked on 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.819
 well yes of course there is a chance that they 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.280
 played out after the flight and showed 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.940
 stronger group is clear now you 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.860
 are dating 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.250
 throw off the gum pajamas with which you are pretty 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.340
 confidently walked through the tournament but yesterday 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.959
 game with empire when empire 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.910
 almost crushed them so she 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.530
 showed some weaknesses 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.390
 some weak points on which 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.549
 which are you still going to use 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.140
 the game against them seems to me they are just 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.200
 recruited such heroes which can be easily 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.519
 add and that is they hit hard 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.470
 gender counterstick u because it happened we 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.739
 just try to collect the best of everything and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.739
 Peak can be easier then
