00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 strider Cyril was conceived as 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.320
 multimedia collaboration between

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.450
 2 separate games for arcade machines 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.790
 ns all three projects have common 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.729
 elements of the storyline but there are also 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.400
 small differences game about strider 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 the strider's adventures people forgot but 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.000
 guys from wrx games could breathe 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.220
 life in a classic creation in front of us 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.659
 distant original only with an eye to that 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.270
 what a modern game should look like 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.909
 as in the original events occur 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.509
 different kinds of dirty work namely 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.539

 dictator in this we will be helped by our 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.159
 weapon super sword with a hilt which 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.409
 allows you to use weapons as thin 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.109
 new ones will be opened gradually 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.340
 movements and abilities to 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.049
 pass the game to the end 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.260
 you have to learn how to use 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.019
 all the variety of techniques and techniques 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.750
 that owns a ninja otherwise long for you 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.420
 stretch fights very showy and the most 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.549
 the main thing is fast our hero is operating a ball 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.959
 with crazy speed and shreds 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.060
 enemies without thinking 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.939
 also you will meet on your own 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.669
 the ways are racy bosses and chop them up 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.470
 small pieces jumping and tackling not 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.720
 only welcome and are 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.819
 by necessity we can say that 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.480
 speed and agility in the key to success 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.049
 this game 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.329
 procrastination estimates only run forward and 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.129
 hack enemies we have to colorful 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.620
 levels with many hiding places 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.319
 which you can study with 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.040
 special as well as in the game a lot 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.840
 locks 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.780
 which open only after 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.090
 acquiring special skills and in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.729
 I would like to conclude by saying that before 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.310
 you are a great example of how 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.829
 revive classic nothing extra everything 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.470
 you need saved where necessary pulled up 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.549
 Well done in one word the game turned out on 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.650
 solid top five 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.049
 but for fans of the side scroller so 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.909
 In general, just find a play 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.340
 sure strider is an example of that 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.739
 how to reanimate the classics 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.729
