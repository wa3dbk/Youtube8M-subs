00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
do know my channel I think it's the one

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.580 
do know my channel I think it's the one
we<00:00:40.469> kill<00:00:40.770> 100<00:00:41.370> wizards<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.510> acolytes<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.050> 200

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
we kill 100 wizards and acolytes or 200

we kill 100 wizards and acolytes or 200
don't<00:00:43.739> remember<00:00:44.040> exactly<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.539> one

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
don't remember exactly so for this one

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.709 
don't remember exactly so for this one
you<00:00:45.719> 500<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.219> basically<00:00:47.670> equates<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you 500 and that basically equates to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
you 500 and that basically equates to
around<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.890> half<00:00:50.100> rounds<00:00:50.579> around<00:00:50.700> the
