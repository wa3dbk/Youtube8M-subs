slide<00:00:21.150> guitar<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.930> I'll<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.710> start<00:00:23.310> by

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
slide guitar so I'll just start by

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.130 
slide guitar so I'll just start by
telling<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> different<00:00:24.539> types<00:00:24.930> of

telling you the different types of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
telling you the different types of
slides<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.890> can<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.789> your

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
slides that you can get what your

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
slides that you can get what your
options<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.510> there's<00:00:28.170> basically<00:00:28.380> three

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
options are there's basically three

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.410 
options are there's basically three
options<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> metal<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
options for you can get a metal one a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.889 
options for you can get a metal one a
glass<00:00:30.900> or<00:00:31.289> ceramic<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> differences

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
glass or ceramic one now the differences

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.350 
glass or ceramic one now the differences
are<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.030> those<00:00:36.180> three

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
are the way and the way in those three

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
are the way and the way in those three
categories<00:00:36.510> are<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> way<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> slide<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
categories are the way the slide is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.979 
categories are the way the slide is
going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> feel<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
going to feel to you and the way the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
going to feel to you and the way the
slide<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> sound<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
slide is going to sound to you the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.850 
slide is going to sound to you the
biggest<00:00:42.180> deal<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> me<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> sounds

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
biggest deal to me is the way it sounds

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.549 
biggest deal to me is the way it sounds
and<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> brighter<00:00:45.320> brasier<00:00:46.320> more

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
metallic sound obviously get a metal

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.270 
metallic sound obviously get a metal
slide<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.829> either<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.250> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
thicker ones don't break as much and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
thicker ones don't break as much and
they<00:01:12.119> give<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.840> weight<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
they give me a little more weight to so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
they give me a little more weight to so
I<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.770> tell<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.299> feels<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I can tell I'm going and it just feels a

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
I can tell I'm going and it just feels a
little<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.810> smoother<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> me<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> want

little bit smoother to me so if you want
to<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.000> slide<00:01:18.299> guitar<00:01:18.630> those<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.960> your

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to get into slide guitar those are your

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.550 
to get into slide guitar those are your
basic<00:01:19.619> main<00:01:20.549> options<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.390> far<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.409> kind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
basic main options as far as what kind

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
basic main options as far as what kind
of<00:01:22.590> slide<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> different

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
of slide you can get and the different

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.929 
of slide you can get and the different
tones<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:25.140> between<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> obviously<00:01:26.460> the

tones in between them and obviously the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.670 
tones in between them and obviously the
feel<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> slide<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> differ

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
feel the slide this is going to differ

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.640 
feel the slide this is going to differ
from<00:01:29.000> glass<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.390> brass<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.380> chrome-plated

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
from glass to brass the chrome-plated

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
from glass to brass the chrome-plated
metal<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.150> ceramic<00:01:33.600> whatever<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
metal or you know ceramic whatever so
