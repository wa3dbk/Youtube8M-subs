when<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> play<00:01:03.210> guitar<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.870> put<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.559> finger

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
when you play guitar and put your finger

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
when you play guitar and put your finger

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
on the middle of the friend but with the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890 
on the middle of the friend but with the
side<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> put<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.330> edge<00:01:09.570> of

third finger across the third fret and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
third finger across the third fret and
then<00:01:34.280> we'll<00:01:34.640> be<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.790> slide<00:01:35.060> down<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.380> second

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
then we'll be a slide down to the second

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.550 
then we'll be a slide down to the second
fret

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.700 

to<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.159> pillow

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.969 

now<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:44.240> show<00:01:44.479> me<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.930> three<00:01:45.650> or<00:01:45.770> four

it's all you do it third fret again

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.280 
it's all you do it third fret again
strike<00:02:46.340> three<00:02:46.609> or<00:02:46.700> four<00:02:46.879> strings<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:48.019> slide

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290

strike three or four strings and slide
down

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.780 

pull<00:02:50.909> off<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.830> back<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.519> way<00:02:56.640> up

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
pull off and then back on all the way up

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.170 
pull off and then back on all the way up
to<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.420> 12th<00:02:57.959> fret<00:02:58.370> once<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.549> reach<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.700> 12th

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
to the 12th fret once you reach the 12th

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.710 
to the 12th fret once you reach the 12th
fret<00:03:00.620> hit<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.799> B<00:03:02.010> string<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.580> altogether<00:03:06.120> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
fret hit the B string so altogether it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.320 
fret hit the B string so altogether it
should<00:03:06.989> sound<00:03:07.200> something<00:03:07.379> like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.350 

that's<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.510> end<00:03:17.630> of<00:03:17.720> lesson<00:03:17.930> 1
