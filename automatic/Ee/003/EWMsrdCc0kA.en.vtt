vibrato<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.840> use<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.250> breath<00:03:23.489> vibrato<00:03:24.209> because

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
vibrato I use the breath vibrato because

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.120 
vibrato I use the breath vibrato because
it<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.709> called<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> diaphragm<00:03:26.900> vibrato

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
it can be called the diaphragm vibrato

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:41.490 
it can be called the diaphragm vibrato
and<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.030> this

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.860 

so<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> vibrato<00:03:43.099> is<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.640> singing<00:03:44.000> quality

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
so the vibrato is that singing quality

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.610 
so the vibrato is that singing quality
that<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.829> add<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.939> tone<00:03:47.239> okay<00:03:48.170> hope<00:03:48.439> you
