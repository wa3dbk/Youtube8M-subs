00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.700
 i 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.250
 hello how are you today I bring you 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.619
 this makeup with texture inspired by 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.900
 mystic of exxon the materials we're going 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.170
 to need are eyeliner or 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.450
 larfs coffee petrolatum latex cotton swabs 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.119
 liquid makeup decorates the middle blue 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.520
 dark blue black and white brushes 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.140
 sponge a spatula and if you want 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.940
 complete the look you can get the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.890
 yellow teeth and hair paint 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.720
 Red color 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 where the coffee browser marks the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.559
 scales all over my face starting with 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 one side to then copy the same 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.620
 figures on the other side in the form of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 mirror 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.710
 Y 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 to mark the scales of the forehead 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.410
 I recommend starting in the middle so that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.770
 leave couples and then continue with 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.770
 the laterals 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.549
 The next thing I did was apply the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.500
 gasoline with a cotton swab inside each 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.179
 scale this has created a movie 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.189
 protective on the skin and prevents the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.619
 latex stick too much and hurt us 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.329
 makeup is important that the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.130
 Vaseline is only applied within the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.420
 scales then the watercolor makeup 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.420
 do not paint on this material 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.210
 Y 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.690
 After a latex apply vaseline 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.580
 using cotton swabs for the scales 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.150
 round and a spatula for the most 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.150
 angled 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 at the beginning the latex will have color 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.230
 white but when drying it will be transparent 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.580
 and it will be time to apply the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.580
 next layer and so on 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.159
 so it should look more or less in the third 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 layer is applied four layers in this 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.519
 makeup but you can apply the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.780
 that you want depending on the volume that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.780
 you want them to have their scales 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.590
 once latex since closing it must 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.599
 to apply watercolor makeup 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.090
 medium blue all over the face except for 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.739
 the scales you can use a brush 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.420
 to apply the first layer and then 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.220
 use a sponge to match the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.220
 color and avoid brushstrokes 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.920
 then begin to paint the scales 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.329
 with the darker blue I use a 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.810
 Brush thin to be more 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.810
 simple 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 with the same dark sky they make up the 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.560
 lips and eyelids to give you more 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.140
 depth then blur them with 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.250
 taps using a sponge 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.079
 subsequently of the ine below the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.079
 lower eyelashes with the same color 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.580
 with black watercolor of flake imeca 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.010
 on the bottom to create a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.420
 effect of greater volume on the scales 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.400
 if you do not have this makeup you can 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.990
 use liquid eyeliner in 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.990
 black color and it will also work 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.240
 Y 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.240
 yes 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.589
 with the help of a sponge apply 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.360
 watercolor makeup white color on 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:13.249
 the bridge of the nose the piquito of the 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.589
 Chin on the sides of the 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.649
 lips and eyebrows to give light and with the 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.269
 finger blurs it with a sponge 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:21.860
 only dark on the sides of the nose 

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.869
 and on the tip to make light and 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.519
 upturned and tuned also in the 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:27.999
 jaw and in the neck to give 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.999
 texture 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.090
 delineates the eyes with makeup 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.620
 watercolor color black and what denominates 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.620
 patting with your finger 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
 and 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.830
 fill in the little holes that I had left and 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.900
 finally I put contact lenses 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.820
 yellows and red paint on the hair and 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.440
