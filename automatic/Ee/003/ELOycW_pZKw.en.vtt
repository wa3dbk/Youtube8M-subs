cool idea not to mention you have a huge
cable<00:05:28.160> then<00:05:28.340> so<00:05:28.550> then<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.790> can<00:05:28.940> he<00:05:29.000> reach

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
cable then so then you can he reach

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.150 
cable then so then you can he reach
around<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.480> the<00:05:29.600> back<00:05:29.720> your<00:05:29.900> machine<00:05:30.260> if<00:05:31.040> you

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
around to the back your machine if you
