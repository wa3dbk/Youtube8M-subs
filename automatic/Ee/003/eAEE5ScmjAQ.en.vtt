00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.279
 the gray sensuality of painted 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.379
 aluminum sends every viewer 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.639
 Immediately on a time trip to the late 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.370
 thirties of the past 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.299
 century functional purism 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.800
 paired with craftsmanship perfection 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 fascinating details of a great one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.410
 concept of auto union type c was one 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.750
 the most powerful racing car of its time 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 a maximum of 750 kilograms should this car 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 without driver fuel oil water and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.359
 Weigh the tires 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 the low weight in combination with 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.510
 the gigantic 6 liter 16 cylinder 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.760
 engine brought scary 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 moving services 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.879
 Today, the few are ready to drive 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940
 only rarely copy from theirs 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.899
 Air-conditioned garages brought 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.719
 it is the mainstay of the matter 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 the audi classic technicians are absolute 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.379
 Experts know exactly which ones 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.399
 conditions your baby on the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.469
 feel most comfortable 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.110
 the details are then on it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.120
 arrives already as the auto union 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.530
 silver arrows were still brand new 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.600
 not about the safety of the driver 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.850
 but about performance exclusively 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 power race victories in the 30s 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.110
 were still far more prestigious than 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 today formula 1 hits the rivals of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 mercedes ferrari maserati and rough buildings 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.479
 The cars are getting stronger and stronger 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.430
 absolutely wanted to keep up 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.430
 the result of the auto union type c 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.720
 he was the most successful German in 1936 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.750
 the reason the car had the monster engine 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.170
 520 ps and a torque of 853 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.790
 newton meters at 2500 revolutions the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 top speed was 340 km / h 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.120
 the tremendous sound sounds only today 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.350
 even on very special occasions for 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.500
 for example, the eighth grand prix 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.900
 historique months to the tax may then 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 Of course only a whole 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.070
 exceptional driver of a like 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.800
 this inconspicuous older gentleman vintage 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.690
 1945 from belgium jacky ickx is one of the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.150
 most successful racer ever 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.530
 twice, he was vice world champion eight 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.420
 Formula 1 victories are on its balance sheet 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.790
 and above all, six victories in the 24th 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.590
 hours of le mans a man who knows 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.060
 how fast driving works 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.959
 and also in front of a monster like the type c 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.959
 do not shrink 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 who will win with this car race 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.579
 He wanted to be robust and fearless 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.659
 his 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.000
 seat belts and fireproof clothing 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:35.220
 did not exist back then 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 for the infernal sound like him 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.170
 probably no other car ever again 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.660
 has produced amazingly far 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.550
 in front you sit in the silver arrow the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.010
 huge mid-engine right in the back 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.570
 at that time had an absolute novelty 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.960
 racing cars until then 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.760
 without exception in front 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.620
 It is absolutely unusual the original 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.440
 sound of this 16 cylinder engine too 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.180
 do like him in 1938 for the last time 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 here was monaco to hear the noise 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.390
 is just incredible but there are 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.150
 we all sound here and that 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.180
 triggered feelings of the auto union type c 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.830
 won three out of five major prizes in 1936 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.240
 half of the rounds run and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.960
 all mountains with auto union 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.270
 participation 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.540
 he was actually that in his day 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.890
 car it's just wonderful because you 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.040
 must remember that the time 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.960
 auto union type c 1938 ever here in 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.850
 Monaco rode with the biggest ones 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.610
 there were roses back then rosenmayr 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.860
 caracciola nuvolari all the big names 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.260
 were there if you have the chance 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.810
 to drive auto union type c then that is 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.980
 just an absolute privilege 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.520
 this incredible car with one 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.260
 weight of only 750 kilo 16 cylinders in 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.290
 the lightweight version with lots of magnesium 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.820
 incredibly amazing how technical 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.750
 the auto union type c developed far 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.850
 at that time already was 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.560
 two roots compressors supplied the 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.750
 engine with compressed air one 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.370
 overhead camshaft controls the 32nd 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.420
 Valves The engine block was complete 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.310
 made of aluminium 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 Which brings us back to the sensuality 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.660
 the pure functionality arrived 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.130
 at the end of our time travel would be the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.490
 actually would have continued for a long time 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.490
 can
