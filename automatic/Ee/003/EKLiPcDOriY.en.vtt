Shannon quality I think that's what's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.319 
Shannon quality I think that's what's

very<00:03:43.659> high<00:03:43.870> rating<00:03:44.260> race<00:03:44.439> and<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.609> think<00:03:46.209> that

very high rating race and I think that

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.949 
very high rating race and I think that
one<00:03:47.439> of<00:03:47.469> those<00:03:48.010> horses<00:03:48.640> or<00:03:48.760> both<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.060> them<00:03:49.390> will

one of those horses or both of them will

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.160 
one of those horses or both of them will

but what would your advice be to people

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.220 
but what would your advice be to people
who<00:04:10.090> do<00:04:10.239> want<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.480> have<00:04:10.569> an<00:04:10.659> early<00:04:10.750> bed<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.139> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
who do want to have an early bed in the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.099 
who do want to have an early bed in the
spring<00:04:11.500> what<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.280> key<00:04:13.090> points<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
spring what are the key points and the

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.990 
spring what are the key points and the
goals<00:04:14.349> they<00:04:14.620> should<00:04:14.859> be<00:04:15.010> going<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.819> pick

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
goals they should be going for to pick

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.939 
goals they should be going for to pick
out<00:04:16.180> when<00:04:16.690> is<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.169> spring<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.650> think<00:04:17.859> the

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
out when is it in spring I think the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.219 
out when is it in spring I think the
form<00:04:18.190> form<00:04:18.849> cycle<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.389> the<00:04:19.419> horses<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:19.989> very

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
form form cycle of the horses is very

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.400 
form form cycle of the horses is very
very<00:04:20.380> important<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:21.099> think<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:22.289> want<00:04:23.289> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
very important I think if you want to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.990 
very important I think if you want to
have<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> bet<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.889> horse<00:04:23.979> in<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.699> a<00:04:24.789> feature

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
have a bet on a horse in it in a feature

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.510 
have a bet on a horse in it in a feature
race<00:04:25.300> look<00:04:25.750> at<00:04:25.840> his<00:04:25.930> previous<00:04:26.410> form<00:04:26.710> what<00:04:27.250> run

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
race look at his previous form what run

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.270 
race look at his previous form what run
from<00:04:27.789> a<00:04:27.910> spill<00:04:28.180> did<00:04:28.599> he<00:04:28.690> peak<00:04:28.930> what<00:04:29.710> run<00:04:29.949> from<00:04:30.160> a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
from a spill did he peak what run from a

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.950 
from a spill did he peak what run from a
spell<00:04:30.550> did<00:04:30.759> he<00:04:30.849> win<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> feature<00:04:31.240> race<00:04:31.599> or<00:04:31.810> run<00:04:31.930> a

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
spell did he win a feature race or run a

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.469 
spell did he win a feature race or run a
great<00:04:32.139> race<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:33.000> anticipate<00:04:34.000> whether<00:04:34.210> that's

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
great race and anticipate whether that's

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.469 
great race and anticipate whether that's
going<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.870> likely<00:04:35.110> be<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:36.310> same<00:04:36.610> run<00:04:36.970> at<00:04:37.240> the

going to likely be the same run at the

Melbourne Cup he's got a he's got a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.969 
Melbourne Cup he's got a he's got a
couple<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.690> really<00:05:28.990> really<00:05:29.380> good<00:05:29.560> assets

another<00:05:30.639> one<00:05:30.880> of<00:05:30.970> his<00:05:31.060> assets<00:05:31.240> he<00:05:31.510> said<00:05:31.690> he<00:05:31.810> had

another one of his assets he said he had

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.520 
another one of his assets he said he had
a<00:05:32.199> an<00:05:32.919> abbreviated<00:05:33.690> autumn<00:05:34.690> campaign<00:05:34.900> of<00:05:35.349> just

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
a an abbreviated autumn campaign of just

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.940 
a an abbreviated autumn campaign of just
one<00:05:35.710> run<00:05:35.919> that's<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.580> very<00:05:36.880> very<00:05:37.090> good<00:05:37.300> pattern

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
one run that's a very very good pattern

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.330 
one run that's a very very good pattern
and<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:38.790> think<00:05:39.470> whether<00:05:40.470> whether<00:05:40.800> he<00:05:40.980> starts

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
and I think whether whether he starts

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.470 
and I think whether whether he starts
shorter<00:05:41.730> than<00:05:41.850> he's<00:05:41.970> thirteen<00:05:42.360> or<00:05:42.450> fourteen

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
shorter than he's thirteen or fourteen

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.720 
shorter than he's thirteen or fourteen
dollars<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.590> years<00:05:43.800> at<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:43.980> moment<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.490> going

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
dollars the years at the moment is going

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.270 
dollars the years at the moment is going
to<00:05:44.820> be<00:05:44.940> all<00:05:45.060> dependent<00:05:45.600> upon<00:05:45.660> his<00:05:46.620> lead<00:05:46.860> up<00:05:47.010> run

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
to be all dependent upon his lead up run

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.180 
to be all dependent upon his lead up run
and<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:48.360> think<00:05:48.600> that<00:05:48.750> his<00:05:48.810> lead<00:05:49.050> up<00:05:49.170> run<00:05:49.410> in<00:05:50.070> the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
and I think that his lead up run in the

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.650 
and I think that his lead up run in the
Caulfield<00:05:50.580> Cup<00:05:50.670> is<00:05:51.000> where<00:05:51.150> he's<00:05:51.300> likely<00:05:51.630> to

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
Caulfield Cup is where he's likely to

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.960 
Caulfield Cup is where he's likely to

the cox plate which I want him to do

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.230
