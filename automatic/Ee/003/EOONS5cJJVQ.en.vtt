prospects<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.220> know<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.490> we've<00:02:20.820> got<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
prospects you know I think we've got the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.420 
prospects you know I think we've got the
opportunity<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.740> down<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.070> Alton

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and I think that kind of gives us a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
and I think that kind of gives us a
barometer<00:02:25.200> how<00:02:25.680> we're<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> be<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:27.180> you

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360
