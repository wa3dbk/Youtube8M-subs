hey<00:00:10.590> everybody<00:00:10.920> dusty<00:00:11.340> from<00:00:11.429> Dynojet<00:00:11.880> here

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
hey everybody dusty from Dynojet here

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.789 
hey everybody dusty from Dynojet here
even<00:00:12.630> though<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> other<00:00:12.960> tune<00:00:13.259> has<00:00:13.500> been<00:00:13.679> out

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
even though the other tune has been out

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.660 
even though the other tune has been out
for<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> few<00:00:14.219> years

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
for a few years

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.310 
for a few years
we<00:00:14.790> still<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> lot<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.509> questions<00:00:15.900> about<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
we still get a lot of questions about it

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.230 
we still get a lot of questions about it
so<00:00:16.470> hopefully<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.160> short<00:00:17.430> video<00:00:17.730> will<00:00:17.970> answer

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so hopefully the short video will answer

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.720 
so hopefully the short video will answer
those<00:00:18.449> questions<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
those questions for you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.830 
those questions for you
what<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> auto-tune<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.960> does<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.199> do

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
what is auto-tune and what does it do

are a lot of other variables to consider

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
are a lot of other variables to consider
if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.079> simply<00:01:37.320> adding<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:37.950> air<00:01:38.070> filter

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
if you are simply adding an air filter

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
if you are simply adding an air filter

that's<00:01:40.409> fairly<00:01:40.619> close<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.490> auto-tune<00:01:41.670> will

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that's fairly close the auto-tune will

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
that's fairly close the auto-tune will
do<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> great<00:01:42.270> job<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> getting<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.079> map<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
do a great job of getting the map to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
do a great job of getting the map to
where<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> needs<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.460> you're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
where it needs to be if you're

thing<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> consider<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> unless<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
thing to consider is that unless you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
thing to consider is that unless you
ride<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> bike<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.890> rpm<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.640> throttle

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
ride the bike at all rpm and throttle

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
ride the bike at all rpm and throttle
ranges<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> sport<00:01:58.140> bike<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.500> could<00:01:58.649> be

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
ranges so on a sport bike this could be

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
ranges so on a sport bike this could be
up<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> 15,000<00:01:59.790> rpm<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.299> wide<00:02:00.450> open<00:02:00.479> throttle

up to 15,000 rpm at wide open throttle

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
up to 15,000 rpm at wide open throttle
then<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> auto-tune<00:02:02.009> cannot<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.670> any

then the auto-tune cannot make any

adjustments while on a dyno you can make

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709
