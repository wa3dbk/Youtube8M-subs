00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.530
 so so at the raptor 700 of the company 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.120
 own term is a 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.530
 helicopter for the 700 class 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.120
 that means we are now using that 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.530
 helicopter here leaves with 6 190 mm 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.170
 length of the limit helicopter will 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.800
 powered by the twelve lipo battery 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.060
 in our case it is now in hkx with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.220
 5000 meters ampere-hour of the 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.960
 engine via an account nick cave 80plus hv 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.370
 which drives the engine in our case 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.790
 but sera 40 30 at y with 470 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 turns per minute over here in the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.449
 To see mechanics is the main goal 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.920
 meshes about 15 millimeters high and the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.150
 heckrotor enters the auto rotation 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.769
 the entire helicopter is in the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.890
 essential parts of carbon fiber 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.440
 Made up of the top one 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 chassis half and lively chassis 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.750
 half of the here now the flight battery of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 front or back with a fast 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.049
 attachment 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 can be fixed and inserted the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 main rotor is of course right or 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 stays and completely made of aluminum 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.450
 made arrangement of the servos 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 once here in the front area 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.180
 the chassis is nothing replaced here behind 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.130
 all servos work with chair 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 Steering on this lever we 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.240
 of course also ball stored 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.159
 are and by the very stable 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.470
 Suspension on the chassis side parts 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.899
 So the whole unit becomes very stiff 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.200
 and thus the steering a lot 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.259
 low so here we see that sander 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.959
 tiger fast calibration system for 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.450
 the servo on steering this metal 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.090
 lever and also an aluminum name 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.619
 clamped 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.190
 the clear width between the chassis 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.530
 Side parts are 54 millimeters 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.049
 So that you can install the engine 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.000
 a maximum of 35 meters diameter have this 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.680
 screws for the reception of the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.840
 Levers are on the inside 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.359
 displaces that so you actually the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.799
 entire team continues the engines 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:37.920
 The deaf slices inside can be exploited 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.970
 Ring is over the bellcrank 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.609
 took 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.040
 the one way reduction to the sheet 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.440
 make cribs upwards 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.660
 So you have rods very nice 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.310
 stand vertically above each other and in 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.120
 an absolutely straight line upwards 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.250
 run as telemetry are so use 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.980
 We do it without you from the company 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.230
 We model all relevant data 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.230
 on our purchase still and system plays 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:12.209
 so the twelve-part lithium polymer battery 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.370
 This battery of China in the back 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.980
 The area has this quick release 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.889
 then glued into the mechanics in 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.500
 front area we have two here 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.930
 tongues under cross-bracing 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.389
 grab in the shade and the beautiful at 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.639
 this plate is all knew the 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.560
 with these velcro straps in 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.420
 Contact is already at the factory 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.980
 clean from rounded so you need 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.659
 Do not worry about that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.919
 someday these velcro closures times 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.919
 break down 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.650
 now here for the millennia 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.780
 our flight the battery voltage with 46 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.310
 want the power consumption is now 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.150
 Of course as well as zero because of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.150
 motor not new anymore
