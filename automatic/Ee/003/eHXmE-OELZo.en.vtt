00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.719
 manufacturer 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.360
 first go to us I called the courier and not

 I 'll have a package wrapper I 'll be given at home 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.260
 that the package number you knew because 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 that moment with courier sense fedex 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.960
 I do not need no waiting for only so 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.039

 open reliability hid got something 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.530
 I opened the box to the thing, I already understood 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.570
 what it doesn't warm what it is in general and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 from where 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.360
 I do not know on delphi 3 ago for a long time with me 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.609
 contacted by mail representatives 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.649
 The manufacturer here is these devices from 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.339
 banks they produce power banks 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.159
 we offered me different capacities 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 get free sample from them ok 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.549
 let's see what you like and you 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.430
 Well, and accordingly, as always 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.340
 standard terms to the center in this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.000
 make a video there review everywhere 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.159
 unpacking 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.130
 up here well of course i will do it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.310
 as if the topic was a channel so as if 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 there will be no problems with the company 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.579
 cog this poverbank if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.770
 at 3200 milliampere but not mistaken that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.590
 such a tulip honestly I do not know that is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.850
 here we have cables for going to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.439
 accordingly for charging 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 an hour there is a charge in charge for 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.689
 LEDs means holy color 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.409
 different dropped black asked such 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.540
 You want to take on and take a black one 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.509
 here are the boxes if that is black 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.100
 cable 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.799
 well then what's the long cable to this in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.079
 Basically, I'm a bank chef, I'm not good 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.409
 very good because because 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.570
 because it means there will be big losses 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.840
 what would be on the ship well, in principle 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.580
 I also think that it may be nice 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.319
 Further that you have something shelves 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.060
 here we have instruction on 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.739
 English language that is it speaks about 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 tom what you say define it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.040
 anticipate and mark on all the same on 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.300
 global market that is not only to china 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.220
 in German place it is American but I 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.930
 look at that is shorter it is 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.930
 of course and like Korean 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 some do not know this seems to be the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.209
 the ruler of the cohour glad to hear from you 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.209
 if it is a youth anti-age 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.400
 someone that's of course but what I will say in 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.900
 about the bank now pre then 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.210
 there will be another test well, give more 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.100
 all would have made immediately in the video is not 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.740
 I will insist on a separate department 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.190
 test as if a separate video to 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.320
 do more of estee tion are all servants in 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 quality is our aluminum then we 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.730
 plastic is our plastic that is 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.860
 powerbank is not heavy there is 3200 mm 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.780
 first possible will be in general we are 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.540
 check that is, so far the first 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 part of the video then us unpacking and in 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.750
 the second part whether and you will see already 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.670
 my test results i mean i 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.500
 did charge-discharge let him see 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.130
 how much he charges is solved Novi Sad 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.010
 how much could he really charge 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.030
 any device that is how much and 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.760
 accordingly from this business year what 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.710
 plus or minus there is a capacity there or not well and 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.320
 Of course, under the video will be a reference to 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.700
 this product that is, if you go 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.990
 You can follow this link. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.320
 video respectively watch and 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.900
 buy or just look well 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.840
 see well I and your business as 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.459
 says little get something 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.959
 test say your opinion 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.520
 honest opinion because it is me 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.410
 no matter what garlic thinks 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.470
 piercing dump popov the fact that 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.380
 did because more important to me 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.540
 so people don't buy let's say no 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.970
 a good product, that is, well, I would do as 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.700
 all honest and there already as they say be 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.410
 what will happen even though I understand perfectly that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.609
 after honest reviews it is after 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.430
 last say so durable goods 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.049
 review and then either happen or order store 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.570
 then his principle to me then his bow and this 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:28.850
 no matter here but in short then for now 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:32.270
 We pause and now that will continue well 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.590
 tested a pair of powerbank on 3200 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.990
 milliampere from the manufacturer screw i 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.250
 saw in their channel what they sent to everyone 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.560
 these different cook jars 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.140
 Well, what can I say is power banks 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.080
 means from full charge asus zenfone 2 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.030
 aktara battery 3000 milliampere 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.100
 powerbank was able to charge up to 90 percent 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.430
 that is, and 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.840
 charging in a very strange way 2 was that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.540
 eat on the first day 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:06.020
 charging he charged it with only 69 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.480
 percent I already thought like all here 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.970
 night he lay this poverbank just me 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.310
 today so before leads ok just pressing 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.250
 He shows 4 divisions such did not understand 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.240
 took hooked up again asus and he caught up 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.580
 asos even up to 90 percent of that is mean 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.630
 by 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.610
 on the test on the tester on the hut tester 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.240
 there are how many charges flowed 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.310
 power-bank 2000 794 milliamps and that is 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.200
 but 2,800 mA somewhere in this 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.640
 powerbank is and charged it through 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.010
 short cable is not through that long 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.630
 which was included because you 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.460
 losses would rather all be big well 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.340
 accordingly did tested charging 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.590
 also on a short pony or what can 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.140
 say that is on powerbank 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.660
 but about yes about 2,800 to maybe in 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.700
 it seems to be there 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.420
 nudists strange thing was this a 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.680
 charges that is yesterday he sort of 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.630
 ordered to live long already asus not 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.720
 I was charging like I pressed everything here already 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.370
 blinked last point and all charges are not 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.380
 today it was connected again further 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.840
 Charges show that he remembers I do not know 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.390
 what it is connected with but nevertheless means 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.180
 by cons of this here 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.160
 incomprehensible thing is 1 + power bank 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.440
 enough 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.880
 I will not say well heated 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.520
 so pretty warm when he 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.980
 charging and when it gives charging 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.860
 need to be discharged and it is suspect that 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.630
 here inside the battery is one for 18,650 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.480
 standard 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.730
 somewhere possible at 2800 milamps means 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.810
 this figure is certainly not quite a bit 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.820
 exactly but if there is generally given 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.650
 all sorts of losses there tudym syudym 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.110
 plus or minus goes to that number 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.250
 which I said means by pluses it 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.310
 metal case 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:55.070
 so by pluses this is compactness 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.070
 we are all principle plus this is an indicator 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.240
 all charge as it is and that it is not 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.680
 considered something like that 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.690
 supernatural means and more to 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.490
 cons take the price the price of this 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.560
 devices because I would personally 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.290
 I wouldn't give that much money 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.470
 Despite all its advantages, I think 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.320
 what is he 16 and 17 dollars then 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.720
 he is not worth a reference to him will be under 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.580
 video so you can go see well 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.170
 and accordingly here are the conclusions of all 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.630
 such is shorter than testing 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.170
 It turned out such a thing to buy not 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.360
 buy look like yourself here 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.940
 make the decision all the same money yours 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.040
 us a video where I will finish better 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.169
 allowed to review anything 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.640
 Thank you all for your attention. 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.090
 watched this video for you personally 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.710
 it was interesting if yes then who leave 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.370
 you know yourself that thank you very much for 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.590
 Attention 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.120
 who is not subscribed subscribe to the channel
