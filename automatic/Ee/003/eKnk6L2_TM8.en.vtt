00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.139
 teach how to make wire bicycles 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.139
 one piece 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.859
 For example, he will make the model of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.859
 careers 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.449
 the race 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880
 A) Yes 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.040
 of the wheel take a piece of pipe 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.689
 you see here couple of laps like this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.970
 now 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.970
 it is passed here for the middle 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.489
 and a half 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.920
 Some will say what is the use of 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.330
 bicycle after adornment as many 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.680
 things that serve as an ornament 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.680
 it's pure craftsmanship 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.429
 because almost almost everything is done hanging 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.789
 with magnets with their hands without any 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.789
 instrument 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.509
 where a couple of things like the wheels 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.509
 to leave them time where are you 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.360
 to my taste learn to do 45 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.820
 escape 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.820
 they started to leave me better 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 the word box is 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.700
 others more 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.490
 we take a little spin 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.350
 I come a post 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 and as for getting home he picked up a 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 piece of wire that I had 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.840
 and I started doing them 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.270
 a week he was already out there selling 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.010
 a friend pounds 100 pesetas 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.010
 years this 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.260
 theory to carry a euro could be 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 sell a bicycle perfectly 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.870
 Once you get practice 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.319
 it can be done I was doing them in 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.319
 seven minutes 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.989
 where you can do a work to a 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.989
 euro 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.930
 I have some friends who dedicated a 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.359
 time to do them 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.019
 and they made money first they bought a 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.950
 van to be able to go around to the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.950
 bikes 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.520
 a van with creations that 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.520
 they bought a flat 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.410
 then of course then it is no longer ablation 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.200
 bicycles made bracelets anxiety in 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.080
 buy a bracelet making machine 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.350
 doing other things but they started with 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.350
 the bike 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.459
 and now they have an impact on burgos 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.459
 near the cathedral 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.510
 I tell you 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.930
 life 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.430
 when I have 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.569
 a cat 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.569
 it gets me all over the place 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.660
 I mention it because now I have him on top 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.520
 of the table at any time can 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.520
 appear like this 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.670
 I have done 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.670
 because over here 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.590
 this is how everything takes practice 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:19.539
 and nothing more 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.539
 and at this time of race career 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.229
 then this is the classic walk 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.240
 It is different because you see mirror 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.180
 rearview and 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.410
 different mudguard 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.600
 then you can do it if you want more 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.020
 You see how small is littlest 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.110
 or even much smaller to hang 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.790
 smallest 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.040
 and then when you have a lot of 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.710
 experience then you can get into doing 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.590
 one stop 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.100
 super small and almost not appreciated 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:00.370
 what you do not have to take a magnifying glass is a 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:04.009
 magnifying glass catch a magnifying glass do not come with a 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.940
 magnifying glass that we can to get to see 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.480
 and nothing more 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.480
 see you later
