00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
playing on a whole nother level compared

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.009

to<00:03:21.010> Arian<00:03:21.370> Foster<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.180> I'm<00:03:22.269> hoping<00:03:22.630> that

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
to Arian Foster and I'm hoping that

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.750 
to Arian Foster and I'm hoping that
we're<00:03:23.170> going<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.500> see<00:03:23.650> more<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.220> once

we're going to see more of that once
Arian<00:03:25.180> Foster<00:03:25.660> actually<00:03:26.019> returns<00:03:26.410> I'm<00:03:26.680> hoping

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
Arian Foster actually returns I'm hoping

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.699 
Arian Foster actually returns I'm hoping
that<00:03:27.459> Arian<00:03:28.060> Foster<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.720> not<00:03:29.049> going<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.440> take

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
that Arian Foster is not going to take

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.039 
that Arian Foster is not going to take
away<00:03:29.950> his<00:03:30.160> playing<00:03:30.459> time<00:03:30.700> but<00:03:31.360> bright<00:03:31.600> back<00:03:31.840> at

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
away his playing time but bright back at

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.110 
away his playing time but bright back at
first<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.530> goal<00:03:32.739> we<00:03:33.040> find<00:03:33.310> McKinnon<00:03:33.760> again

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
first and goal we find McKinnon again

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.150 
first and goal we find McKinnon again
and<00:03:34.390> this<00:03:34.810> time<00:03:34.870> unfortunately<00:03:35.470> he<00:03:35.920> gets

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and this time unfortunately he gets

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.819 
and this time unfortunately he gets
tackled<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.150> now<00:03:37.359> we're<00:03:37.780> sitting<00:03:37.959> at<00:03:38.230> second

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829
