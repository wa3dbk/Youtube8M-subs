and<00:05:50.159> do<00:05:50.610> some<00:05:50.819> benchmarks<00:05:51.389> as<00:05:51.539> well<00:05:51.719> I'm<00:05:51.930> gonna

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
and do some benchmarks as well I'm gonna

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.110 
and do some benchmarks as well I'm gonna
try<00:05:52.259> out<00:05:52.379> battlefield<00:05:52.919> 4<00:05:53.339> and<00:05:53.610> see<00:05:53.789> how<00:05:53.909> well

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
try out battlefield 4 and see how well

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.300 
try out battlefield 4 and see how well
it<00:05:54.150> runs<00:05:54.419> on<00:05:54.629> that<00:05:54.810> probably<00:05:55.800> gonna<00:05:55.919> look<00:05:56.129> at

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
it runs on that probably gonna look at

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.040 
it runs on that probably gonna look at
something<00:05:56.610> like<00:05:56.759> medium<00:05:57.330> settings<00:05:57.810> that'll

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
something like medium settings that'll

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.119 
something like medium settings that'll
probably<00:05:58.169> be<00:05:58.409> something<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:58.889> will<00:05:59.099> be

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
probably be something that will be

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.999 
probably be something that will be
playable<00:05:59.909> and<00:06:00.629> then<00:06:01.319> gonna<00:06:01.680> run<00:06:01.889> it<00:06:01.979> through

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
playable and then gonna run it through

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.230 
playable and then gonna run it through
some<00:06:02.219> 3dmark<00:06:03.029> maybe<00:06:03.839> PC<00:06:04.319> mark<00:06:04.909> to<00:06:05.909> see<00:06:06.089> what

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
some 3dmark maybe PC mark to see what

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.950 
some 3dmark maybe PC mark to see what
this<00:06:06.389> thing<00:06:06.599> can<00:06:06.719> punch<00:06:07.050> out<00:06:08.210> if<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.719> haven't

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
this thing can punch out if I haven't

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.869 
this thing can punch out if I haven't
told<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.259> already<00:06:10.440> this<00:06:10.919> is<00:06:11.129> just<00:06:11.610> under
