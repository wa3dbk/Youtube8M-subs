can see from this picture here the
colors<00:00:59.370> used<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> dark<00:01:00.539> navy<00:01:00.719> blue

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.189 
colors used were like a dark navy blue
with<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:02.010> vibrant<00:01:02.309> red<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.660> personally

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
with a pretty vibrant red I personally

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.190 
with a pretty vibrant red I personally
like<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> design<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.090> blue<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.930> red

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
like the design if the blue was red

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
like the design if the blue was red
black<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.400> kind<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.790> better<00:01:09.180> but

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
black it would kind of look better but

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.899 
black it would kind of look better but
that<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.530> looks<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> same<00:01:10.920> pretty<00:01:11.760> much

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that it all looks the same pretty much

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
that it all looks the same pretty much
from<00:01:12.119> far<00:01:12.330> away<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> looks<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.049> black<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
from far away it looks like black and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.520 
from far away it looks like black and
die<00:01:14.100> yeah<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
die yeah that's that so a one thing I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.539 
die yeah that's that so a one thing I
did<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> mention<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:19.189> way<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
did want to mention was that the way the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
did want to mention was that the way the
hinges<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> sides<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:22.979> really

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
hinges work on the sides you can really

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.109 
hinges work on the sides you can really
tell<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> metal<00:01:26.189> steel<00:01:26.490> bar<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
tell here but it's a metal steel bar and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.060 
tell here but it's a metal steel bar and
then<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.630> curves<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> stops<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
then it curves so that it stops at a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.429 
then it curves so that it stops at a
certain<00:01:29.310> point<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.780> jump<00:01:30.960> over<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
certain point now if we jump over to the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.160 
certain point now if we jump over to the
left<00:01:32.250> side<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.490> believe<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.270> can't<00:01:34.049> really

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
left side I believe it is I can't really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.370 
left side I believe it is I can't really
I<00:01:34.470> forgot<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.369> side<00:01:35.930> doesn't<00:01:36.930> work<00:01:37.140> yeah

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I forgot which side doesn't work yeah

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
I forgot which side doesn't work yeah
it's<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> left<00:01:37.799> side<00:01:37.979> sorry<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.000> side

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it's the left side sorry so this side

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's the left side sorry so this side
you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:42.450> bar<00:01:42.689> goes<00:01:43.259> too

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you can see that the the bar goes too

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
you can see that the the bar goes too
far<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:44.040> into<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.820> plastic<00:01:45.030> piece

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
far down into the little plastic piece

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
far down into the little plastic piece
here<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> jump<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> other<00:01:46.950> one

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
here so if we jump back to the other one

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
twisting it something you really

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.340 
twisting it something you really
shouldn't<00:02:15.280> do<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.550> your<00:02:15.640> headphones<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.930> it

not<00:02:31.450> really<00:02:31.660> scared<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:32.140> all<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
not really scared at all but on the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.270 
not really scared at all but on the
sides<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.030> go<00:02:35.020> down<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.680> up<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.069> down<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
sides they do go down and up and down a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.229 
sides they do go down and up and down a
little<00:02:36.780> faster<00:02:37.780> than<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:39.489> would<00:02:40.090> like

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
little faster than I really would like

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.960

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
kind of go down a little bit or expand

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
kind of go down a little bit or expand
they<00:02:50.200> wouldn't<00:02:50.380> they<00:02:50.709> won't<00:02:50.920> stay<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.250> the

thinking about purchasing these
headphones<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:59.170> cushion<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.920> sides

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
headphones the cushion on the sides

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.670 
headphones the cushion on the sides
there<00:03:00.489> they<00:03:01.060> are<00:03:01.090> pretty<00:03:01.450> comfortable<00:03:02.019> one

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
there they are pretty comfortable one

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.350 
there they are pretty comfortable one
thing<00:03:02.830> i<00:03:02.920> don't<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:04.030> doesn't

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
thing i don't like is that it doesn't

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.410 
thing i don't like is that it doesn't
curve<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:05.319> doesn't<00:03:05.670> turn<00:03:06.670> i<00:03:07.000> think<00:03:07.239> on<00:03:07.330> a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
curve it doesn't turn i think on a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.259 
curve it doesn't turn i think on a
y-axis<00:03:07.630> if<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.410> makes<00:03:08.590> sense<00:03:09.150> obviously<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
y-axis if that makes sense obviously the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.229 
y-axis if that makes sense obviously the
headphone<00:03:10.660> speak<00:03:10.989> they<00:03:11.350> go<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:12.819> it<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
headphone speak they go like it on the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.759 
headphone speak they go like it on the
x-axis<00:03:13.660> but<00:03:14.140> it'll<00:03:14.709> turn<00:03:15.510> run<00:03:16.510> clockwise<00:03:17.380> and

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
x-axis but it'll turn run clockwise and

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.199 
x-axis but it'll turn run clockwise and
counterclockwise<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.700> kind<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.940> if

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
counterclockwise like that kind of if

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.020 
counterclockwise like that kind of if
you<00:03:19.780> understand<00:03:20.140> what<00:03:20.260> i<00:03:20.320> mean<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.700> lot<00:03:21.940> of
