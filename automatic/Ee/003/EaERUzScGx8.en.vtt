00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
I figured out a solution to it it's just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.010 
I figured out a solution to it it's just
gonna<00:01:11.790> take<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.240> time<00:01:12.450> than<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:12.960> for

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
gonna take more time than it will for

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010 
gonna take more time than it will for
this<00:01:13.320> video<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.729> hopefully<00:01:15.240> I'll

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this video to be out so hopefully I'll

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
this video to be out so hopefully I'll
have<00:01:16.170> everything<00:01:16.409> squared<00:01:16.830> away<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> few

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have everything squared away in a few
