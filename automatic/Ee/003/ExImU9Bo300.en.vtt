 on the way to miss france 2013 the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.099

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.630
 elegance and simplicity for miss 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.400
 bordeaux we were put back on the day 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 same day we made the election the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 evening for miss aquitaine ya more than 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.180
 preparation it was a little bit 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 intensive 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 because you had to learn several 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.809
 short and in a short time we leave everything 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 little november we fly to sri-lanka 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.750
 preparations 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 for at least three weeks for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
 miss france so i think the lily 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 France must be of necessity 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 represent all that is beauty 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.300
 elegance but but must also 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.059
 represented to simplicity and I think 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.100
 that it is a quality that I have and that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.600
 I want to defend in fact so if 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 I'm elected here that's what 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.149
 I would like to represent it is especially the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 simplicity that it important value so 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.689
 here and I do not think that all 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 unfortunately, so here we go 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.040
 why me compared to others 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 a candidate who has all her 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 chances for the supreme title 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.400

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 already been interviewed is asked for 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.130
 advertisements several times a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.689
 pressure she digests and henry it was 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
 there are lots of things jostling each other 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 miss france you still have to have a 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.570
 mental 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 pretty strong enough not to be too much 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.479
