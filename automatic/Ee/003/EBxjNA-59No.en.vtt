number is divisible by two and three

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.360 
number is divisible by two and three
both<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.670> divisible<00:02:51.970> by<00:02:52.270> six<00:02:52.720> also

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
both then it is divisible by six also

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.300 
both then it is divisible by six also
what<00:02:54.370> about<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:55.090> number<00:02:55.450> four<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:57.040> last

two digits of any number are divisible
by<00:02:59.980> four

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
by four

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.910

then<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.269> number<00:03:03.599> also<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.319> divisible<00:03:04.680> by

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
then the number also is divisible by

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.490 
then the number also is divisible by

6536 add 36 which is divisible by 4 now

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.000 
6536 add 36 which is divisible by 4 now
