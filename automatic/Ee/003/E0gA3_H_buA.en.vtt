00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello want together in this winter 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.040
 I show how I like the Japanese 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.000
 did kirschblüte 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.790
 the app a chic 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 she is a symbol of beauty and 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.470
 transience and just as well 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 to hold everyone 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 before we have to do the whole construction 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.380
 We first make small branches 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.750
 I have already done a lot and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 I show how I did that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.330
 I took three colors there are so 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.620
 teaches to pick white and pink and then have 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:52.260
 I took 15 fight of the white color 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 about 10-15 of the purple and about 40 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.840
 taken from the pink and brought 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 then they all mixed together 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.340
 I did not cut off the advice and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.909
 simply from the container all 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.080
 collected and now I make out 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.530
 five 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.740
 5 I break up about five 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.159
 centimeter this distance even more 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.159
 be longer then I make a mesh 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:41.090
 and then I turn a mesh in 2012 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:46.520
 is ready to make such an impression 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.520
 we need to do 18 after about one 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.830
 centimeter again make a mesh 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.830
 turn five again 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.730
 now i have made 18 machines and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.290
 then I count six pieces from six 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.550
 mesh and the seventh this is this 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.340
 industry from above then I have to do all 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.890
 these wide parts connect with each other 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.790
 that means I have to continue this mesh 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 turn around 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.680
 I kick that to the point when I am 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.980
 notice that their step pretty much holds 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.910
 to firm is bad because then the can 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.340
 state go broke and if that's the case 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.340
 We think it's not good either 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.980
 after I've shot four times 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.690
 In 1234, I count two more stitches 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.670
 except this mesh 12 and then this 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.550
 becomes the obama 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.050
 that means I can still another night 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:31.370
 and then I look here 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.050
 example, a mesh falls and I want 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.950
 I do not want them either 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.700
 if you do something like that first 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.350
 you always want two stitches 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.290
 you can still stand side by side 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.550
 a mesh we do that depends on 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.550
 your wish 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.960
 künast is finished we need of course 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.530
 much more and i would suggest that 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:28.480
 he not only makes such but also 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:31.720
 very simple long or very short to 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.060
 example, because then if we all 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.570
 that will connect real ones 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.430
 be pretty good if under that 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.740
 such as such times 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.770
 turn up or such or smaller ones 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.770
 such for example and so on 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.640
 after small first can be done 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.150
 Let's join them together now 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.720
 and so make a bigger branch and 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.720
 then tree 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.690
 after getting a 3 first with each other 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.310
 connected 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:21.169
 Now I take a thicker kicked and 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.330
 then I fix everything with the father 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.229
 I take brown colors with it 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.229
 can stretch 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.419
 I'll do some of those 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.680
 first then binding this larger one 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:02.020
 branches in a big branch and so on 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.210
 Eating a few sizes creates a tree for 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.840
 I still take the trunk of the tree 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:11.819
 Higher degree of rent the tree 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.819
 remains stable 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:28.159
 I have all four parts together 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:30.979
 connected and then the branches a bit 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.969
 made as well as they did in the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.080
 are nature 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.119
 I want to see how big my tree is 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.839
 and then I thought so 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:45.979
 tree exactly in this pot 1 20 I take 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:50.659
 I mix this glass with glue here 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:54.199
 everything and then build it and let it go 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:58.069
 so for a few days because glue will 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:01.369
 Do not dry so fast as the stones 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:05.629
 Green you could think that that 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:10.209
 is grass and show the next photos 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.209
 what I did exactly
