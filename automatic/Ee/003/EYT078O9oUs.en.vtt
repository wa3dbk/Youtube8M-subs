00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
shouldn't be too bad at all and then

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.370

shouldn't be too bad at all to deal with
I<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.950> even<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.340> they'll<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.729> show

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.250 

once<00:01:53.920> all<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.280> weathering<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:55.260> airbrushing

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
once all the weathering and airbrushing

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.990 
once all the weathering and airbrushing
and<00:01:56.590> all<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.920> stuff<00:01:57.070> is<00:01:57.370> done<00:01:57.580> they'll

initially<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.350> entirely<00:02:47.710> different<00:02:48.250> I

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.620

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630

there<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.200> been<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.440> our<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.560> few<00:02:53.770> days

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
there but it's been in our a few days

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.770 
there but it's been in our a few days
now<00:02:56.459> yeah<00:02:57.459> so<00:02:57.730> next<00:02:58.000> time<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.209> can<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:58.600> this<00:02:58.720> in

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
now yeah so next time I can get this in

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.650 
now yeah so next time I can get this in
some<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.350> good<00:02:59.590> light<00:03:00.060> when<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.209> all<00:03:01.360> dry

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.310 
some really good light when it's all dry
I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.520> pretty<00:03:03.850> much<00:03:04.060> all<00:03:05.050> there<00:03:05.260> is

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
I think this is pretty much all there is

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.780 
I think this is pretty much all there is
that<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:06.070> for<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:09.010> far<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> colors

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that I'm going for as far as the colors

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
that I'm going for as far as the colors
go<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:12.600> apart<00:03:13.600> from<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.870> front<00:03:14.110> where<00:03:14.290> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
go so apart from the front where it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.140 
go so apart from the front where it
still<00:03:14.620> needs<00:03:14.830> some<00:03:15.010> yellow<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.430> red<00:03:15.550> we're<00:03:15.940> on
