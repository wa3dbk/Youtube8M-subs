00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi I'm Andy snowy Pines Ridge Farm we're

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi I'm Andy snowy Pines Ridge Farm we're
getting<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> lot<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.480> questions<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
getting a lot of questions on the

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.519 
getting a lot of questions on the
website<00:00:04.470> regarding<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.339> aquaponic<00:00:06.000> system

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
website regarding the aquaponic system

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.200 
website regarding the aquaponic system
so<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:07.649> thought<00:00:08.189> we'd<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> quick<00:00:08.790> video<00:00:08.970> this

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
so we thought we'd do a quick video this

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.330 
so we thought we'd do a quick video this
morning<00:00:09.570> outdoors<00:00:10.260> it's<00:00:10.500> about<00:00:10.650> 42<00:00:11.070> degrees

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
morning outdoors it's about 42 degrees

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.049 
morning outdoors it's about 42 degrees
indoors<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.719> 80<00:00:13.099> 82<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.610> now

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
indoors here it's about 80 82 right now

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.120 
indoors here it's about 80 82 right now
so<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> hot<00:00:15.719> tubs<00:00:16.020> retain<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> lot<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.949> heat

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
so the hot tubs retain a lot of the heat

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.689 
so the hot tubs retain a lot of the heat
to<00:00:17.490> help<00:00:17.760> Keith<00:00:18.270> greenhouse<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> hot<00:00:20.220> tub<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to help Keith greenhouse the hot tub is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.330 
to help Keith greenhouse the hot tub is
built<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.240> log<00:00:21.510> base<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.380> built<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.890> up<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
built on a log base I built it up on the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
built on a log base I built it up on the
log<00:00:23.490> base<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> knew<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
log base because I knew it was going to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
log base because I knew it was going to
be<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.410> heavy<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.890> picked<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> hot<00:00:26.580> tub<00:00:26.880> up

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
be pretty heavy I picked the hot tub up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.950 
be pretty heavy I picked the hot tub up
at<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> local<00:00:27.630> spa<00:00:27.900> dealer<00:00:29.269> some<00:00:30.269> customer<00:00:30.750> came

the pH that I took the other night just
to<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.510> at

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
to see where we're at

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190

over<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.070> warmer<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> solar<00:00:48.870> light

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
over on for warmer I have a solar light

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.889 
over on for warmer I have a solar light
that<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.860> only<00:00:50.160> helps<00:00:50.460> attract<00:00:51.390> bugs<00:00:51.690> at

pruning that I had of an apple tree it
started<00:02:47.640> sprouting<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.239> thought<00:02:48.480> well<00:02:48.659> heck

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
started sprouting so I thought well heck

started sprouting so I thought well heck
I'll<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.769> ahead<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.099> put<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.609> grow<00:02:50.790> bed

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I'll go ahead and put it in the grow bed

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.349 
I'll go ahead and put it in the grow bed
see<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.359> can<00:02:51.450> grow<00:02:51.629> some<00:02:51.810> looks<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:53.280> as<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
see if I can grow some looks then as the
