00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.840
 Welcome to this second installment of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.239
 traumatic childhood that from this 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.710
 video I'm going to call traumatic reviews of 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.120
 some way we can reach more than 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.309
 100 little friends so I'm really 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.870
 grateful to all of you for 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.540
 celebrate I will take the order of a 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 good friend of mine the user because more than 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.320
 the follower of the beginnings of his 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.449
 humble channel the friend asked me to review 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.890
 a game that had him barely 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.900
 he suggested it brought me some bad 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
 memories also as indicated by the title 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.750
 of the video we are going to see legend of caguÃ© 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.490
 this game development portal history by 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.500
 1986 is a comparison of a game 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.450
 arcade that came out a year before the fact 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.510
 it's not like it's an action game styles 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.479
 scrolling where our character that yes 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.250
 it is pronounced here wine that really is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.380
 a young man and that has the mission that 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.640
 when he did not rule out princesses in 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 this case the princess here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.180
 it seems that it was fashionable in those times 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.220
 back princesses and to achieve their 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 objective that has to travel diverse 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.229
 places of ancient Japan full of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.700
 ninjas priests and samurai like 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.560
 we can see if a pretty graphics 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.690
 fart but I always say that the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.420
 graphics are not all the main point 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.310
 for me today mainly game 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 it's fun and that's what I'm going to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 analyze more than anything the weapons that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 uses are nissan starlets or their 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 origin that we can throw in any 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.850
 address has even cast though 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.430
 crouched has only put to the left 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 like me when I go to the bathroom and they can only 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 appear two stars on the screen 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.330
 the other weapon that has the short sword 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
 we use with the button can say what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.380
 fuck the little stars Augustin side and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 they go further even the sword does not 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.950
 It is used for lines but they are wrong 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.959
 Apart from attacking closely they can 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.880
 stop them jumping and enemies 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.280
 - priests egg smoke bombs 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.590
 by a combination of both weapons it fits 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.820
 it is almost invincible to jump there is 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.100
 press up and here is the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.900
 main feature of the cab yes 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.580
 that's why we remember this game is for the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 made the jump so high 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.480
 and there would be a rocket in the ortho but here 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.800
 is once we are in the air not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.960
 we have the freedom to control the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.370
 jump as for example in the mario bros 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.530
 this is a weakness you have to calculate 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.640
 where we want to go as we can 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 find us with a surprise 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 unpleasant 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.260
 It is also possible to climb the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.210
 trees or even jump from the branches of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.190
 one tree to the other is like the version on 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.110
 tiger game and the dragon is in 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.690
 reality that is based on written 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090
 kung fu the 70s all fight was with 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.490
 cables the first level is in my opinion 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.990
 it is more complicated of all as I said 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.040
 before we have the freedom to go for 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.240
 any side 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.280
 that makes us want to spend years 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.900
 jumping crazy but the only thing we're going 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.030
 to get like that is to kill us more 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.800
 easy what I recommend is advanced 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.540
 of the sheets without worrying about jumping 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.380
 alternating the little stars and the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.940
 sword 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.920
 so we repel any attack that comes 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.130
 front and last we accept when we 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.130
 agree 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.760
 so we come to this phase line 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.590
 but it's over until we defeat the 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.060
 red priest who appears when 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.920
 they want this what makes codes of 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
 first level you have to defeat a 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.780
 number of enemies until it appears 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.220
 this enemy more here the monks blue the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.709
 fireball priests can not be 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.960
 repel with sword I feel that the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.420
 mother 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.340
 in the second level we have to defeat 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.380
 to 10 line can hide in the water 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.140
 although the slow medium sure enough 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 apart from a small guy and if you have the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.370
 water and kill seven miles with sword going 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.910
 to appear a small blue ring and if 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.040
 they catch it elevated in a life 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.720
 but since I am a hardhead in patients 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.170
 I always go in front and lose comunico 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.209
 tip 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.220
 the third phase and the easiest and all 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.900
 what you have to do is get to 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.760
 up all of them climbing the walls 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.220
 of the castle do not stop keeping up 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.200
 to jump using full sword to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.790
 cover the attacks of others 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.470
 I'm going to interject jump to one side or 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.079
 for the other but never forget about 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.609
 keep up the fourth phase we are 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.079
 inside the castle may seem 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.760
 complicated than moving fast 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.710
 interspersing stars and swords as 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.419
 we did before they will be fine when 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.980
 see stairs go by walking and climb 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.450
 I just need to press up to go up 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.610
 let's get to where he is captive 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.710
 to the princess here more free we would look 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.810
 here he cut the rope with the sword if he 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.110
 makes goes to mosquera we play the game that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.110
 It was like this 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.520
 it's worse than it's practically always 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.560
 reaching the fifth phase we return to 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.259
 forest but there is a white priest who 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.389
 sometimes it is divided in two and we attack it 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.039
 directly you can not kill and that 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.470
 Butterfly fucking never stops fucking 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.300
 you have to kill the guancha now yes 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.680
 we can defeat priests the kills 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.390
 of the priest you have to kill the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.240
 butterfly makes sense 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.280
 and we reached the forest again but beware 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.320
 it's autumn they can eliminate us from those 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.390
 games that repeat levels and only 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.400
 the same fucking music repeats the levels 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.990
 it is repeated throughout the game although 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.390
 have where to hear the snow is at 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.330
 8 climate level 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.410
 what is a game without for borax that can 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.270
 improve your skills 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.370
 each time the enemies release small 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.620
 orbes that when you take them out, change the 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.540
 colored clothes when you finish green this 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.090
 they give you extra punch the little stars are 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.890
 bigger get to counter when 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.930
 we are green the clothes change yellow 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.970
 we keep having only one extra punch 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.689
 but now they fit much faster and 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.669
 we can jump even higher 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.979
 treating small ring countries of 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.289
 colors and when you touch it you can give 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:55.840
 from points you would see the blue of a 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.880
 life the red of special attacks 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.800
 Very rarely does this stream appear 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.139
 look like a little girl and what she does 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.479
 it's a pretty scary super attack that 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.979
 defeat all enemies on screen 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.720
 the thing that is is that here is the 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.400
 place and then when we continue 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.990
 advancing they come back from the enemies as 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.900
 always so the only thing he does is 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.900
 score points 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.900
 22.30 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.010
 the game does not have continue it only has 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.840
 two lives can seem at first very 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.210
 fucked but it 's a matter of grabbing the 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.230
 hand and have patience after passing 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.270
 again for all phases 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.610
 previous we arrived back to the temple 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.569
 and we return to rescue the princess if 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.360
 we won the game or not 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.309
 you're running me now we have to 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.740
 defeat a similar boss finish according to 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:42.479
 the text of the game is called jokin or suv 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.279
 killing but before we have to 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.469
 to take care of the butterflies butterflies nothing 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.229
 very complicated luckily again 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:50.610
 we come to the forest now it's winter 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.889
 low by which we enter that I think that 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.810
 It's ten in a few months 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.849
 we passed furiously through all phases 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.050
 previous although I have to say that 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.759
 only at the forest level are they in 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.949
 conflict we are relatively more 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.389
 easy because height because it is very 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.300
 little patience because you're guardians 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.340
 biotic killing 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.750
 well finally we arrived at the temple you 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.360
 I swear that the last time I rescued you 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.969
 princess of the ortho 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.319
 can not be crazy again he tried me 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.560
 When the danger is scary, you're 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:21.650
 taking the hair as new bosses 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.689
 Syrian samurai he uses we kill the 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.550
 butterflies we are a shit belt 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:27.289
 which is not very complicated and now safe 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.699
 that touches us in spring seasons 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.969
 this height and nothing surprises me of this 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:36.080
 game that is this that meets with the 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:38.870
 crisis if they end up designing let's go the 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.729
 final credits fuck sweethearts fell with 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.080
 one that can happen as a kid 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:46.169
 crazy 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.020
 is carrying andrÃ¡s with seven sisters 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:50.610
 ate and the bitch that bore you that bad 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.030
 host son of a truck won from 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.030
 whores
