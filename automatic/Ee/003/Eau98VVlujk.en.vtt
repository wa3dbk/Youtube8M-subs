2 this is an evolution of the product

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.720 
2 this is an evolution of the product
there<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.320> e<00:00:22.500> module<00:00:23.039> where<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.580> see

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
there is the e module where you can see

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.189 
there is the e module where you can see
they're<00:00:23.939> hermetically<00:00:24.359> sealed<00:00:24.660> compressor

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
they're hermetically sealed compressor

they're hermetically sealed compressor
on<00:00:25.320> board<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.310> typically<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.090> used<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
on board this typically would be used in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.970 
on board this typically would be used in
applications<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> large

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
applications where there's a large

amount of high voltage AC such as
trolley<00:00:31.470> bus<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.460> we're<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:32.850> excited

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
trolley bus and then we're very excited

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.569 
trolley bus and then we're very excited
to<00:00:33.630> introduce<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.410> module<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.370> both

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to introduce you a module which has both

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.970 
to introduce you a module which has both
the<00:00:35.850> compressor<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.390> board<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.649> thermic

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the compressor on board and the thermic

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
the compressor on board and the thermic
in<00:00:38.129> power<00:00:38.430> electronics<00:00:39.110> those<00:00:40.110> power

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
in power electronics those power

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
in power electronics those power
electronics<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.190> able<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> work<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.030> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
electronics are able to work with just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
electronics are able to work with just
about<00:00:42.360> any<00:00:42.750> input<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.340> we

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
about any input as you can see we

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
about any input as you can see we
actually<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> bus<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> unit<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
actually have a bus with a unit on the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.619 
actually have a bus with a unit on the
top<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.309> bus<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.700> pull<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> there

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
top and the bus can pull up and there

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.860 
top and the bus can pull up and there
can<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.559> standby<00:00:50.100> location<00:00:50.850> where<00:00:51.120> AC<00:00:51.420> power

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
can be a standby location where AC power

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
can be a standby location where AC power
is<00:00:52.020> available<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.789> particularly

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
is available so this is particularly

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
is available so this is particularly
useful<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.469> instance<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.460> pre<00:00:56.670> calling<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
useful for instance for pre calling the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
useful for instance for pre calling the
bus<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> morning

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bus in the morning

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
bus in the morning
this<00:00:59.219> means<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.820> we've<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.149> higher<00:01:00.390> levels

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this means that we've got higher levels

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.100 
this means that we've got higher levels
of<00:01:01.050> efficiency<00:01:01.609> we've<00:01:02.609> invested<00:01:03.270> heavily<00:01:03.480> in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of efficiency we've invested heavily in

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
of efficiency we've invested heavily in
the<00:01:04.260> R&amp;D<00:01:04.949> center<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.939> Czech<00:01:06.150> Republic<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the R&amp;D center in the Czech Republic and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
the R&amp;D center in the Czech Republic and
this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> cool<00:01:07.680> things<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this is one of the cool things that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.140 
this is one of the cool things that
they've<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.280> working<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> power

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
they've been working on the power

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.810 
they've been working on the power
electronics<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.260> system<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> we

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
electronics this system here that we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.480 
electronics this system here that we
have<00:01:12.000> today<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> medically<00:01:13.560> sealed<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
have today is a medically sealed so the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
have today is a medically sealed so the
compressor<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.270> onboard<00:01:15.450> meaning<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.470> we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
compressor is onboard meaning that we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.010 
compressor is onboard meaning that we
have<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.220> low<00:01:17.700> amount<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> refrigerant<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
have a low amount of refrigerant and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
have a low amount of refrigerant and
quite<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> small<00:01:19.650> refrigerant<00:01:20.369> circuit<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
quite a small refrigerant circuit that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
quite a small refrigerant circuit that
means<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> different

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
means that we can use the different

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
means that we can use the different
refrigerants<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> we'll<00:01:24.090> be

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
refrigerants that we see that we'll be

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
refrigerants that we see that we'll be
using<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> future<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> board<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
using in the future on board with this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.249 
using in the future on board with this
unit<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> technology<00:01:28.080> that's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
unit we have the technology that's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
unit we have the technology that's
allowing<00:01:28.560> us<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.920> deliver<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.939> efficiency

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
allowing us to deliver the efficiency

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.569 
allowing us to deliver the efficiency
savings<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.110> big<00:01:31.619> part<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> comes<00:01:32.460> from

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
savings a big part of that comes from

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
savings a big part of that comes from
the<00:01:32.700> fact<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.450> decouples<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:35.100> the
