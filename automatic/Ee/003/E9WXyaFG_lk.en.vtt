00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439 

all<00:00:00.840> right<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.110> here<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.319> got<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.770> Dell<00:00:02.520> XPS<00:00:03.030> and

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
all right so here I got the Dell XPS and

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.640 
all right so here I got the Dell XPS and
you<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.659> see<00:00:03.899> I've<00:00:04.110> made<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.380> lot<00:00:04.620> of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
you can see I've made a lot of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.059 
you can see I've made a lot of
modifications<00:00:05.569> but<00:00:06.569> basically<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.470> graphics

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
modifications but basically the graphics

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.930 
modifications but basically the graphics
card<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.550> came<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:10.260> Dell<00:00:10.590> XPS<00:00:10.940> 8700

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
card that came with it the Dell XPS 8700

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.900 
card that came with it the Dell XPS 8700
I<00:00:12.090> switched<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.740> card

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I switched it out for a card

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.960 
I switched it out for a card
I<00:00:14.940> think<00:00:15.420> 7750<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> could<00:00:17.340> put<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.699> six

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
I think 7750 that I could put in six

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.359 
I think 7750 that I could put in six
inputs<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.470> Dell<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.220> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
inputs in the thing with Dell is that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.740 
inputs in the thing with Dell is that
they<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.820> feature<00:00:24.619> built-in<00:00:25.760> that

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:39.619 

right<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> BIOS<00:00:32.690> it<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:39.420> won't

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
right in BIOS it will actually it won't

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.229 
right in BIOS it will actually it won't
let<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.960> card<00:00:40.230> start<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.090> having

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
let your card start up so I was having

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
let your card start up so I was having
this<00:00:42.420> issue<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.050> old<00:00:43.200> card<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> would<00:00:43.680> start

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this issue the old card it would start

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.200 
this issue the old card it would start
up<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.280> fine<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> new<00:00:46.350> card<00:00:47.210> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
up just fine but the new card it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.850 
up just fine but the new card it
wouldn't<00:00:48.539> start<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.170> pressing<00:00:49.530> f2

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
wouldn't start up so I'm pressing f2

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
wouldn't start up so I'm pressing f2
right<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> keyboard<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.329> access<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
right now on the keyboard to access the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.500 
right now on the keyboard to access the
BIOS<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> now<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> here

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
BIOS and so now I'm in here

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.619 
BIOS and so now I'm in here
let<00:00:54.629> me<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.610> multiple<00:00:56.610> monitors<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.360> but

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
let me just multiple monitors here but

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.860 
let me just multiple monitors here but
the<00:00:58.609> there's<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> glare<00:01:00.300> sorry<00:01:00.719> about

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the there's kind of a glare sorry about

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
the there's kind of a glare sorry about
that<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> flash<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.829> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that because the flash is on but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.500 
that because the flash is on but
basically<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.900> boot<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
basically you just go up to boot and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
basically you just go up to boot and
then<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> secure<00:01:10.439> boot<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
then you see the secure boot you want to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
then you see the secure boot you want to
turn<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> off<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> before<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.049> enabled

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
turn that off so before it was enabled

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
turn that off so before it was enabled
and<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.810> preventing<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.369> hardware<00:01:23.090> for

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and that was preventing the hardware for

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
and that was preventing the hardware for
my<00:01:24.180> graphics<00:01:24.570> card<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.900> start<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> went<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
my graphics card to start so I went in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
my graphics card to start so I went in
and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> disabled<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> leave<00:01:31.140> UEFI

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and I disabled it and you can leave UEFI

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
and I disabled it and you can leave UEFI
on<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> need<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> for

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
on because you kind of need that for

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
on because you kind of need that for
Windows<00:01:33.900> 8.1<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.420> then<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> course<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.990> just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Windows 8.1 and then of course you just

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.399 
Windows 8.1 and then of course you just
save<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:38.150> now<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> already<00:01:39.689> had<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.320> I'm

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
save it now I already had it on so I'm

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.760 
save it now I already had it on so I'm
just<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> discard<00:01:40.950> changes<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
just going to discard changes and so so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.649 
just going to discard changes and so so
basically<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.430> happening<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.090> with

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
basically what was happening was with

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
basically what was happening was with
the<00:01:45.899> new<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> graphics<00:01:47.070> card<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.610> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the new with the graphics card that I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
the new with the graphics card that I
put<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.229> remove<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> old<00:01:50.250> Dell<00:01:51.740> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
put in the and remove the old Dell it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
put in the and remove the old Dell it
would<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.909> wouldn't<00:01:54.270> even<00:01:54.299> boot<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
would it wouldn't even boot up the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.679 
would it wouldn't even boot up the
screen<00:01:55.890> wouldn't<00:01:56.189> even<00:01:56.280> show<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.689> BIOS

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
screen wouldn't even show up BIOS

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.670 
screen wouldn't even show up BIOS
wouldn't<00:01:58.590> even<00:01:58.799> load<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:01.320> led<00:02:01.500> me<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
wouldn't even load up so that led me to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.639 
wouldn't even load up so that led me to
believe<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.390> after<00:02:03.390> even<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.560> know

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
believe that after even a and I you know

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.560 
believe that after even a and I you know
search<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> forums<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.240> led<00:02:06.420> me<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
search on the forums and that led me to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.770 
search on the forums and that led me to
believe<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.930> Dell<00:02:07.409> had<00:02:07.649> some<00:02:07.920> weird

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
believe that Dell had some weird

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.639 
believe that Dell had some weird
mechanism<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> was<00:02:10.050> preventing<00:02:10.349> my

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
mechanism that was preventing my

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.240 
mechanism that was preventing my
graphics<00:02:11.069> cards<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.700> called<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.209> Dell

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
graphics cards I called up Dell

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.250 
graphics cards I called up Dell
they<00:02:13.310> basically<00:02:13.550> said<00:02:16.000> only<00:02:17.000> authorized<00:02:17.810> L

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
they basically said only authorized L

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.070 
they basically said only authorized L
cards<00:02:18.770> would<00:02:19.520> boot<00:02:19.820> up<00:02:20.000> with<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:20.660> computer

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
cards would boot up with the computer

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.690 
cards would boot up with the computer
and<00:02:21.230> because<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:22.130> card<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.850> was<00:02:23.270> a<00:02:24.250> 7750<00:02:25.250> wasn't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.920 

wasn't<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.910> their<00:02:29.090> approved<00:02:29.420> list

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
wasn't on their approved list

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.260 
wasn't on their approved list
they<00:02:30.080> couldn't<00:02:30.380> technically<00:02:30.950> support<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.520> so

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
they couldn't technically support it so
