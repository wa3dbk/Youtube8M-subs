good stuff
I<00:00:52.170> think<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.379> family<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.949> oh<00:00:53.190> we're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I think my family was like oh we're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.189 
I think my family was like oh we're
gonna<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.600> New<00:00:54.750> Year's<00:00:54.899> week

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
gonna be here for the New Year's week

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.840 
gonna be here for the New Year's week
and<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.860> okay<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.699> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and I was just like okay I'm gonna be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.060 
and I was just like okay I'm gonna be
here<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.719> less<00:00:58.020> than<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.289> week<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
here for a little less than a week so I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
here for a little less than a week so I
thought<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.789> should<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.180> some<00:01:00.359> video

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
thought maybe I should do some video

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.060 
thought maybe I should do some video
since<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> don't<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> lot<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> things

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
since I don't really do a lot of things

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650 
since I don't really do a lot of things
up<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.520> before<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.879> left<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.329> planned<00:01:03.539> ahead

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
up here before we left I planned ahead

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
up here before we left I planned ahead
and<00:01:04.080> knew<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.830> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> videos<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.580> gonna

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and knew what kind of videos I was gonna

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
and knew what kind of videos I was gonna
do<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> knew<00:01:06.479> what<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> bring<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.530> wouldn't

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
do so I knew what to bring so I wouldn't

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200 
do so I knew what to bring so I wouldn't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
like over Packard and I think because I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450
