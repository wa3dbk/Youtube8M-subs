00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.560
 Hi all 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.810
 good morning good this tutorial what 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.430
 I'll do I'll teach 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:16.280
 I have been asked how to record the content 1.6 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.580
 they did not wear then what I'm going to do 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.029
 in this tutorial is to explain how 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.060
 recorded I use the program 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:30.470
 fraps there are many programs to record 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.980
 but this is the best not your 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.040
 characteristic is that you can not see the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.520
 pointer when we use the sight between 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.990
 other things 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.300
 I have some videos on my channel 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.720
 recorded with phrases like that of the pro 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.510
 evolution and more good first thing 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.640
 we have to make the link it leaves in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 description the link where you can 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 download the frax through mediafire 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.369
 the download is very simple 268 megs a 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.700
 Once they downloaded now must 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.430
 explain how it is set up well this is 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 the frap and here in general 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.280
 I have also activated the two 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.660
 first these phrases and sentences windows 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.430
 hardware are top 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.430
 basically the first thing that indicates that the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.640
 flap is going to start when the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.500
 computer and it will be minimized 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.680
 we go to the tab 15 99 fps good here 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.290
 up where is the pointer you 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.990
 they have to choose where they want to record 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.690
 the video where they want the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.430
 video that I record I have it in 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.990
 desk but hey you can you 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.590
 put a special folder or a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 special location 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 here gives you to choose the options of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.130
 of the commands I put f10 and hope 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.159
 that you can put the equity 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.380
 recommends f10 and French because this is 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.660
 active when we are playing and not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.080
 we have to use buttons that do not 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.160
 seduce for the game 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.850
 here in bÃ©dmar settings we are going to mark the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.819
 first option 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.930
 fraps fps 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.450
 do this weinman after we're going to mark 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.689
 everything that can be given this means 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.420
 stop recording so many 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.340
 good seconds let's put the maximum 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.439
 what can be 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.780
 here we have to choose because when 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.150
 we record with flaps appear numbered 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.400
 yellows we have to choose where we 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.189
 are going to locate these numbers the best is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.049
 the upper left corner because not 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:54.579
 never bother us and nothing important there 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.540
 and mark the online option overlay 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.909
 ones to code 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.219
 let's go to the movies that is what we 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.430
 interest in what we're going to use to 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.200
 record the game here is the same can 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.000
 choose where you want to save them or by 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.819
 defect uses the desktop 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.549
 but you can get fat where you want 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.129
 This is important here that go button 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.700
 to use to start and stop 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.959
 finish recording I have this and 9 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.569
 you can put the one you want 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.540
 that does not intervene with the functions of 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:34.400
 game but I recommend f9 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:40.800
 here on video capture settings marc on 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.060
 the last option 29 points 97 alf 6 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.830
 the buffer 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.620
 all the maximum seconds here good here 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.630
 they can record with sound then first 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.670
 he has to set records 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.599
 mark the record option win seven sound 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.599
 stereo 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.160
 may have the option to record with 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.960
 sound 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.710
 Here you can choose if you record with a 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.320
 microphone or external game but I so 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.319
 general not grade with sound but here 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.630
 they can put 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.280
 the external record of input with using 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.340
 microphone in this case I'm using my 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.919
 vehicular with microphone 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.410
 and here they can put only lonely capture 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.630
 the wild using can put a key 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.160
 special that indicates when it will start 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.620
 record the sound for example the bar 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.260
 spacer that means that when 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.990
 pretend spacer to start 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.540
 record or if you do not uncheck it and already 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.740
 start praised voice from the start I 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.860
 I'm going to get the sound because in a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.370
 openwork with sound and in that we go to the 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.729
 tab scan shots screenshot are photos 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.580
 to the screen here you can choose where the 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.260
 they will save by default I have it in 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 a folder in the folder inside the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:04.500
 Frap screenshots but nothing I 'm not going to 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.500
 the desk to this story 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.009
 and here choose the key with which 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:12.009
 he wants to write shots because anybody 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.039
 I put f10 but it's just that 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.100
 remember which keys they will place for 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.290
 those functions 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.270
 and the format in which they want it to be 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.070
 great writes the best the jpg but 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.970
 It depends what you like me 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.620
 jpg recommend and that's all that 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.870
 have to do is minimize the frap 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.510
 are going to open the game for example in this 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.210
 case the 1.6 strike control when 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.880
 open I do not open because it's very simple 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.010
 I explain when they open it they will see each 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.000
 top left corner numbers 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:50.520
 yellows in the game press for 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.950
 example in this case we put fm 9 for 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.670
 start recording as pressure on fm 9 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.260
 inside the game 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.510
 the yellow numbers is going to turn 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.190
 in red numbers do not worry 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.700
 your numbers because they do not come out in the 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.650
 final video 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.210
 The only thing he does is tell him that he is 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.479
 recording phrases per second 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.580
 well then as a mark in red 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.860
 while three red numbers indicates that 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.080
 is recording if they want to finish the 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.770
 video press through 2009 and it 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.560
 they keep in the place where where where 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.599
 they placed that should be saved and that's 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.550
 all questions or suggestions the 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.430
 comments I like if it served you the 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.430
 video and good feed tutorials and I'm going to 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.130
 be raising them when you have 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.280
 opportunity so it was thanks and up 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.280
 then
