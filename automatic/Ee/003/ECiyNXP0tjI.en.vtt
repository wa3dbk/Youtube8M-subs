00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have it like this now you will see a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
have it like this now you will see a
little<00:01:20.369> bit<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.729> slight<00:01:20.970> discoloration

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
little bit of a slight discoloration

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.010 
little bit of a slight discoloration
from<00:01:22.439> doing<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.369> both<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> where

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
from doing that on both that and where

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.520 
from doing that on both that and where
the<00:01:25.140> prangs<00:01:25.380> removes<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> back<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the prangs removes on the back but it's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
the prangs removes on the back but it's
kind<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> barely<00:01:30.060> noticeable<00:01:30.450> unless<00:01:30.869> you're

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
kind of barely noticeable unless you're

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
kind of barely noticeable unless you're
like<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.650> looking<00:01:31.950> hard<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> did<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like really looking hard but I did that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
like really looking hard but I did that
essentially<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> pay

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
essentially just so I don't have to pay

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.520 
essentially just so I don't have to pay
for<00:01:36.420> back<00:01:37.020> printing<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> way<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
for back printing and I like the way the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.380 
for back printing and I like the way the
shook<00:01:40.530> color<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.189> whatnot<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
shook color and whatnot was because it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
shook color and whatnot was because it
came<00:01:42.600> close<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> movie<00:01:45.920> version<00:01:47.390> now<00:01:48.390> you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
is it's got a double face so kind of

is it's got a double face so kind of
have<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.790> almost<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.270> Deadite<00:02:13.690> looking

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.869 

but<00:02:22.610> those<00:02:22.909> are<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.920> torso<00:02:24.920> pieces<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
but those are the torso pieces and the

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.610 
but those are the torso pieces and the
pants<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.450> course<00:02:26.480> are<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.349> brown

or<00:02:28.030> reddish<00:02:29.030> brown<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:32.060> pulled<00:02:32.569> replace

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
or reddish brown and I pulled replace

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.839 
or reddish brown and I pulled replace
the<00:02:33.470> arm<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.909> one<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.700> fleshie<00:02:37.700> I

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
the arm on this one with a fleshie I

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.360 
the arm on this one with a fleshie I
guess<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.299> was<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> mermaid<00:02:38.720> mermaid<00:02:39.290> arm<00:02:39.680> from

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
guess it was a mermaid mermaid arm from

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.770 
guess it was a mermaid mermaid arm from
one<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.640> parts<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.090> Caribbean<00:02:41.330> sets

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
one of the parts of the Caribbean sets

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.289 
one of the parts of the Caribbean sets
and<00:02:43.239> replaced<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.360> hand<00:02:44.599> with<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.230> gray<00:02:46.299> robot

versions<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.490> them<00:04:27.380> this<00:04:28.380> one<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> found<00:04:28.860> online

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
versions of them this one I found online

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.219 
versions of them this one I found online
of<00:04:30.600> somebody<00:04:30.960> using<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.410> two<00:04:31.680> red<00:04:32.520> bricks<00:04:33.229> and

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
I just used some of the other stuff to

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.350 
I just used some of the other stuff to
fill<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:36.840> gaps<00:04:37.370> like<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.580> one<00:04:38.760> tile<00:04:39.030> piece

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360

and this black color clip and like a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.590 
and this black color clip and like a
silver<00:04:45.479> I<00:04:46.729> don't<00:04:47.729> know<00:04:47.789> what<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.270> but<00:04:48.449> it

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
silver I don't know what it is but it

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.300 
silver I don't know what it is but it
just<00:04:48.810> gives<00:04:48.960> me<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.169> better<00:04:49.560> chance<00:04:49.680> I'll<00:04:50.130> feel

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
just gives me a better chance I'll feel

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.439 
just gives me a better chance I'll feel
and<00:04:53.310> then<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.550> one<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.789> did<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> slight

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
and then this one I did a slight

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.980 
and then this one I did a slight
modification<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.260> chainsaw<00:04:55.620> blade

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
modification on the chainsaw blade

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.260 
modification on the chainsaw blade
because<00:04:57.990> I<00:04:58.229> cut<00:04:58.620> off<00:04:58.800> some<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.280> tip<00:05:02.270> so

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
because I cut off some of the tip so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.279 
because I cut off some of the tip so
that<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.570> fits<00:05:03.900> in<00:05:04.470> there<00:05:05.810> better<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.050> still

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
that it fits in there better and still

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.439 
that it fits in there better and still
give<00:05:07.440> room<00:05:07.680> for<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.949> hand<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> get<00:05:08.430> in<00:05:08.639> because

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
give room for the hand to get in because

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.379 
give room for the hand to get in because
if<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.750> leave<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.199> as<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.990> long<00:05:13.910> then<00:05:14.910> the

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
if you leave it as this long then the

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.830 
if you leave it as this long then the
whenever<00:05:15.990> you're<00:05:16.139> using<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.650> this<00:05:16.860> one<00:05:17.840> it

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
whenever you're using it on this one it

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.719 
whenever you're using it on this one it
sticks<00:05:19.200> out<00:05:19.349> a<00:05:19.410> bit<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.310> just<00:05:20.460> kind<00:05:20.639> of

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
sticks out a bit and it just kind of

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.100 
sticks out a bit and it just kind of
looks<00:05:20.940> off<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.889> didn't<00:05:23.190> quite<00:05:23.340> like<00:05:23.400> that<00:05:23.880> so

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.480 

basically<00:05:28.110> it's<00:05:28.380> up<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.919> you<00:05:29.039> as<00:05:29.130> to<00:05:29.310> how<00:05:29.340> you

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
basically it's up to you as to how you

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.520 
basically it's up to you as to how you
want<00:05:30.180> your<00:05:30.330> chainsaws<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:30.990> can<00:05:31.110> either<00:05:31.320> have

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
want your chainsaws you can either have

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.790 
want your chainsaws you can either have
them<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.039> through<00:05:32.539> booth<00:05:33.539> because<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.650> me<00:05:34.770> I

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
them go through booth because to me I

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.000 
them go through booth because to me I
think<00:05:34.919> this<00:05:35.160> one<00:05:35.340> is<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.460> little<00:05:35.550> bit<00:05:35.760> too<00:05:35.910> big

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
think this one is a little bit too big

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.219 
think this one is a little bit too big
or<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.039> can<00:05:38.310> go<00:05:38.400> cut<00:05:38.729> small<00:05:39.000> which<00:05:39.360> still<00:05:39.750> kind

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
or you can go cut small which still kind

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.240 
or you can go cut small which still kind
of<00:05:40.320> gets<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.530> point<00:05:40.800> across<00:05:42.919> but<00:05:43.919> just<00:05:44.160> to

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
of gets the point across but just to

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.430 
of gets the point across but just to
give<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.580> reference<00:05:45.150> we<00:05:45.870> put<00:05:46.020> them<00:05:46.110> on<00:05:46.200> both

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
give you a reference we put them on both

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:56.120 
give you a reference we put them on both
figures

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:09.680 

this<00:05:57.130> is<00:05:57.310> how<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:58.690> one<00:05:58.930> fits<00:05:59.199> on<00:05:59.380> this<00:05:59.590> one

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.909 

and<00:06:10.690> I<00:06:11.080> was<00:06:11.349> throw<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.710> other<00:06:11.830> one<00:06:11.949> on<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:13.919> big

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
and I was throw the other one on the big

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:33.270 
and I was throw the other one on the big
one<00:06:15.099> on<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.880> other<00:06:16.210> guy

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.770 

so<00:06:34.450> that's<00:06:35.450> about<00:06:35.600> it<00:06:37.120> for<00:06:38.120> these<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.330> little

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
so that's about it for these a little

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.590 
so that's about it for these a little
bit<00:06:38.840> goes<00:06:39.110> it's<00:06:39.290> pretty<00:06:39.350> easy<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:39.950> do<00:06:40.130> just

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
bit goes it's pretty easy to do just

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.710 
bit goes it's pretty easy to do just
finding<00:06:41.600> like<00:06:41.840> the<00:06:42.020> parts<00:06:42.290> for<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:43.720> chainsaws

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
finding like the parts for the chainsaws

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.270 
finding like the parts for the chainsaws
