our only hope this will destroy the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.490 
our only hope this will destroy the
machine<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.699> do<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:46.060> we<00:04:46.660> must<00:04:46.870> first<00:04:47.110> figure

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
machine to do that we must first figure

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.600 
machine to do that we must first figure
out<00:04:47.620> how<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.130> works

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
out how it works

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.719 
out how it works
sure<00:04:49.060> crazy<00:04:49.449> I'm<00:04:49.990> attacking<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:51.010> need<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.550> here
