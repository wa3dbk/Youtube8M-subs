ERNST REIJSEGER: Ladies and gentlemen - this
is a cello! [laughter]

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.729

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.319
ERNST REIJSEGER: Yes, I'm cheating. [laughter]
This was made for me. Especially, this was

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.739
a dream. I've always wanted to have a five-string
cello. I can go high enough and if you don't

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.989
have the low notes you cannot play them. And
I finally have it. So this is it. I've been

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.809
playing on it for 3 years. It's called __
and it's addictive.

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:59.699
WERNER HERZOG: Can you play the lowest pitch
for us? And some of the very highest that

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.329
you can reach ...

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.799
ERNST REIJSEGER: YEAH.

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.799
WERNER HERZOG: And very high pitch of course
with all the tones.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.959
ERNST REIJSEGER: Yeah.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.550
[applause]
