00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
I think this is the fight but Byram

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
I think this is the fight but Byram
really<00:01:00.239> once<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> he's<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.020> trying<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> hide

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
really once and he's just trying to hide

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
really once and he's just trying to hide
it<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.920> much<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.309> possible<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.940> now

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it as much as possible right now

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
it as much as possible right now
I<00:01:03.290> believe<00:01:04.290> he<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.530> wants<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
I believe he really wants to make this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
I believe he really wants to make this
fight<00:01:05.460> happen<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:08.549> says<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:10.350> would

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

definitely<00:04:49.290> lost<00:04:49.500> this<00:04:49.710> time<00:04:50.420> if<00:04:51.420> you<00:04:51.630> look<00:04:51.810> at

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
definitely lost this time if you look at

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.500 
definitely lost this time if you look at
the<00:04:52.050> first<00:04:52.230> three<00:04:52.560> fights<00:04:52.910> all<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.180> them<00:04:54.360> are

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510

closed<00:04:56.180> that's<00:04:57.180> why<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:57.390> don't<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:57.900> agree

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
closed that's why I don't really agree

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.850

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
don't really take it passionately if

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.870 
don't really take it passionately if
someone<00:05:04.110> says<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.470> Marquez<00:05:04.980> won<00:05:05.370> all

do it all all those three fights were

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.130 
do it all all those three fights were
close<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:17.040> if<00:05:17.970> someone<00:05:18.330> says<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:18.540> Pacquiao

close and if someone says that Pacquiao

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.070 
close and if someone says that Pacquiao
won<00:05:19.440> all<00:05:19.680> those<00:05:20.010> first<00:05:20.400> three<00:05:20.640> fights<00:05:20.910> I<00:05:21.210> won't

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
you going for Pacquiao winning that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.100 
you going for Pacquiao winning that
fight<00:05:26.580> because<00:05:26.880> all<00:05:27.060> three<00:05:27.540> fights<00:05:27.840> were

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
fight because all three fights were

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.810 
fight because all three fights were
close<00:05:28.500> in<00:05:28.680> my<00:05:28.800> opinion<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:30.860> had<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.040> a<00:05:32.190> drawed<00:05:32.580> I

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
close in my opinion I had it a drawed I

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.940 
close in my opinion I had it a drawed I
had<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.180> rivalry<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.810> drop<00:05:34.230> before<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.710> fort

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
had the rivalry a drop before the fort

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.790 
had the rivalry a drop before the fort
fight<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.390> thought<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.810> first<00:05:36.990> fight<00:05:37.290> was<00:05:37.530> a

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
fight I thought the first fight was a

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.130 
fight I thought the first fight was a
draw<00:05:38.280> second<00:05:38.940> fight<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.150> thought<00:05:39.540> pakkir<00:05:39.930> one<00:05:40.110> I

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
draw second fight I thought pakkir one I

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.660 
draw second fight I thought pakkir one I
thought<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.590> knockdown<00:05:40.800> was<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.280> difference

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
thought the knockdown was the difference

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.450 
thought the knockdown was the difference
third<00:05:42.300> fight<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.600> thought<00:05:42.960> my<00:05:43.770> case<00:05:44.010> definitely

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
third fight I thought my case definitely

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.460 
third fight I thought my case definitely
won<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.910> fight<00:05:45.150> in<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.360> close<00:05:45.600> one<00:05:45.840> but<00:05:46.440> I

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
won the fight in a close one but I

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.050 
won the fight in a close one but I
thought<00:05:46.680> Marquez<00:05:47.130> definitely<00:05:47.670> pulled<00:05:47.940> off

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
thought Marquez definitely pulled off

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.590 
thought Marquez definitely pulled off
that<00:05:48.270> one<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:50.070> fourth<00:05:50.310> fight<00:05:50.600> should

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
that one and the fourth fight should

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.130 
that one and the fourth fight should
have<00:05:51.810> just<00:05:52.250> ended<00:05:53.480> it<00:05:54.480> should<00:05:54.870> have<00:05:54.990> just

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
have just ended it should have just

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.280 
have just ended it should have just
ended<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.470> rivalry<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.630> mean<00:05:57.630> one<00:05:57.840> fighter

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
ended the rivalry I mean one fighter

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.950 
ended the rivalry I mean one fighter
wasn't<00:05:58.650> able<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:59.040> win<00:05:59.960> decisively

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
wasn't able to win decisively

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.420 
wasn't able to win decisively
convincingly<00:06:01.890> by<00:06:02.550> winning<00:06:03.000> by<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.180> knockout<00:06:04.430> so

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
convincingly by winning by a knockout so

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.720 
convincingly by winning by a knockout so
to<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:05.940> people<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.330> really<00:06:06.390> want<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.780> see<00:06:06.840> a

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
to the people that really want to see a

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.130 
to the people that really want to see a
fair<00:06:08.730> fight<00:06:08.970> do<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.270> guys<00:06:09.450> think<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:09.930> fight

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
fair fight do you guys think the fight

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.510 
fair fight do you guys think the fight
will<00:06:10.320> actually<00:06:10.620> have<00:06:10.800> that<00:06:10.950> much<00:06:11.190> meaning

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
will actually have that much meaning

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.880 
will actually have that much meaning
into<00:06:11.850> it<00:06:11.970> because<00:06:12.180> in<00:06:13.050> my<00:06:13.260> opinion<00:06:13.620> I<00:06:13.800> don't

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
into it because in my opinion I don't

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.480 
into it because in my opinion I don't
think<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.460> does<00:06:15.170> to<00:06:16.170> me<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.590> was<00:06:16.710> just<00:06:16.740> a<00:06:17.190> fair

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
think it does to me that was just a fair

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.880 
think it does to me that was just a fair
fight<00:06:17.700> would<00:06:17.880> be<00:06:17.910> just<00:06:18.360> a<00:06:18.570> fight<00:06:18.990> for<00:06:19.320> money

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
fight would be just a fight for money

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.920 
fight would be just a fight for money
not<00:06:20.520> legacy<00:06:21.530> not<00:06:22.530> anything<00:06:22.860> else<00:06:23.750> it<00:06:24.750> won't

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
not legacy not anything else it won't

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.050 
not legacy not anything else it won't
have<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.080> much<00:06:25.350> meaning<00:06:25.620> into<00:06:25.890> it<00:06:27.590> so<00:06:28.590> I

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
have that much meaning into it so I

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.700 
have that much meaning into it so I
don't<00:06:30.060> know<00:06:30.150> man<00:06:30.390> a<00:06:30.690> lot<00:06:31.170> of<00:06:31.230> people<00:06:31.440> want<00:06:31.620> to

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
don't know man a lot of people want to

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.640 
don't know man a lot of people want to
see<00:06:31.860> a<00:06:31.890> free<00:06:32.610> fight<00:06:32.940> I<00:06:33.180> mean<00:06:33.630> I'll<00:06:33.750> definitely

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
see a free fight I mean I'll definitely

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.320 
see a free fight I mean I'll definitely
watch<00:06:34.800> it<00:06:35.040> of<00:06:35.190> course<00:06:35.370> because<00:06:35.730> it's<00:06:35.880> Pacquiao

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
watch it of course because it's Pacquiao

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.370 
watch it of course because it's Pacquiao
in<00:06:36.450> my<00:06:36.600> case<00:06:36.870> but<00:06:37.650> to<00:06:37.710> me<00:06:38.010> it

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
in my case but to me it

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.690 
in my case but to me it
it<00:06:40.380> just<00:06:40.590> doesn't<00:06:40.800> have<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.010> much<00:06:41.220> meaning<00:06:41.490> to

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700 
it just doesn't have the much meaning to

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.390 
it just doesn't have the much meaning to
it<00:06:41.910> I'd<00:06:42.720> rather<00:06:42.960> see<00:06:43.200> Pacquiao<00:06:43.650> fight<00:06:43.710> Bradley

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
it I'd rather see Pacquiao fight Bradley

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.510 
it I'd rather see Pacquiao fight Bradley
again<00:06:44.700> I'd<00:06:44.940> rather<00:06:45.120> see<00:06:45.330> Marquez<00:06:46.160> try<00:06:47.160> to<00:06:47.220> win

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
again I'd rather see Marquez try to win

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.990
