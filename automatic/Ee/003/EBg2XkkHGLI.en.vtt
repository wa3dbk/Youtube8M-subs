wood-burning stove the six-inch flue and
we<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> five<00:00:14.099> inch<00:00:14.599> air<00:00:15.599> feed<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.230> going

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we got a five inch air feed to going

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
we got a five inch air feed to going
through<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> middle<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.340> thing<00:00:20.960> it's<00:00:21.960> an

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
through the middle of this thing it's an

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.099 
through the middle of this thing it's an
adjustable<00:00:26.000> shelf<00:00:27.000> air<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> control<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> air

flow<00:00:28.279> probably<00:00:29.279> burn<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.240> or

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
flow probably burn it about like that or

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.650 
flow probably burn it about like that or
even<00:00:30.750> less<00:00:31.969> see<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> air<00:00:33.210> goes<00:00:33.360> down<00:00:33.390> through

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
even less see the air goes down through

without<00:01:23.729> his<00:01:24.030> plans<00:01:25.880> basically<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.320> bottom

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
without his plans basically the bottom

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.569 
without his plans basically the bottom
of<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> 5<00:01:29.009> inch<00:01:29.220> feed<00:01:29.490> tube<00:01:30.110> ends<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:32.250> five

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
of that 5 inch feed tube ends about five

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.890 
of that 5 inch feed tube ends about five
inches<00:01:32.880> above<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> burner<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> copper

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
inches above the burner and the copper

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
inches above the burner and the copper
oil<00:01:37.079> feed<00:01:37.380> tube<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.829> gonna<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.159> run<00:01:38.340> down<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
oil feed tube is gonna be run down the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.899 
oil feed tube is gonna be run down the
middle<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:40.040> five<00:01:41.040> inch<00:01:41.250> air<00:01:41.400> tube<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
middle of that five inch air tube and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
middle of that five inch air tube and
it'll<00:01:42.090> stop<00:01:42.329> 2<00:01:42.600> inches<00:01:42.899> short<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> bottom

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it'll stop 2 inches short at the bottom

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.289 
it'll stop 2 inches short at the bottom
so<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.340> exposed<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> super<00:01:45.270> high

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so it's not exposed to the super high

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
so it's not exposed to the super high
heat<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> inside<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> burner

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.650 

so<00:01:51.630> basically<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:53.410> prep<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.920> building

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:07.249 

right<00:01:58.660> in<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.840> center<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.430> steel<00:02:06.670> plate

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
right in the center just a steel plate

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.180 
right in the center just a steel plate
we<00:02:08.259> get<00:02:08.470> welded<00:02:08.800> there<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> little<00:02:12.490> moon

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
we get welded there get a little moon

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.820 
we get welded there get a little moon
ring<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.290> have<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.650> burner<00:02:18.400> machine<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
ring and have this burner machine so it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:40.360 
ring and have this burner machine so it
fits<00:02:21.070> right<00:02:21.190> into<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> ring

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.290 

like<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.930 

you<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.050> burner<00:02:50.290> installed<00:02:50.740> and<00:02:51.010> should

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
you get that burner installed and should

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.960 
you get that burner installed and should
be<00:02:52.060> ready<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.480> field<00:02:52.690> test
