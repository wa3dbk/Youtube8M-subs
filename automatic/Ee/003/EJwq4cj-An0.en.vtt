00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.879
 engineering department of the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.709
 emirates company dubai airport the 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.099
 clock starts to run as soon as a 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.590
 airplane enters through these doors every 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.470
 second that is on land is a second 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.790
 who does not make money 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 these devices need a service 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.609
 Quick 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.660
 and this team of qualified technicians 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.100
 you need space to work 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.360
 and it has cost 300 million euros and it is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.239
 the most advanced workshop in the world 8 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.680
 115 meter wide hangars 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.180
 big enough to fit the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.180
 giant devices of the future 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.620
 2 km of corridors on two levels if a 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.420
 building of this size was built 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.280
 with metal would affect the radar of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.079
 airport to the guidance systems of the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.680
 landing and the sensors of the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.020
 appliances 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.940
 that's why the hangars have anti doors 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 radar built with light materials 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.350
 as polycarbonate platforms of 120 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.880
 tons like these mobile gateways 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.850
 facilitate access to all areas of 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.860
 the planes every year more than 100 aircraft 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.530
 they go through this place to undergo 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 repairs and revisions and all should 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 be in perfect condition when 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.390
 march 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.149
 every six years a device passes a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.380
 total revision known as 8 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.659
 consists of more than just bloating 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.700
 the tires and check the oil and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 for this the engineers need to have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.210
 access to the last millimeter of the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.400
 airplane 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.250
 and there the heavy ones come into action 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.619
 gateways just like our cars 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 must pass a mandatory review the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.760
 passenger planes also need 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.710
 receive a clearance to fly to 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.479
 make sure you can do it here 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 literally undo the plane in 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.590
 pieces these technicians can take longer 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.630
 of a month in dismantling an airplane and returning 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 to assemble it disassemble the seats 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.630
 carpets the sinks the air 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
 conditioning the lights 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.080
 compartments for luggage and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.819
 panels of the walls until only 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.680
 the bare metal is left 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.510
 the engineering department of 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.579
 emirates must have the capacity to 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.079
 take care of any task from 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.969
 minor damage in the rooms until 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.310
 major repairs to the system 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.230
 of navigation and radar some of the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.999
 most vital jobs they do here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.579
 they concentrate on the maintenance and 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.290
 engine repair every 3,500 flights 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.879
 you have to disassemble the engines of the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.220
 wings and apply a treatment 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.830
 full 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.510
 in a jet with turbo fan like this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.240
 The moving parts can rotate up to 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.280
 10,000 times per minute so that each 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.020
 component must be inspected 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.360
 regularly looking for signs of 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.220
 wear or failure although a defect does not 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.050
 be dangerous can reduce the effectiveness 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.050
 something that is very expensive 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.670
 for serious repairs are needed 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.439
 spare parts there is no time to wait for the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.290
 delivery of orders so here 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.530
 usually have spare parts by hand 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.510
 this is the parts department is 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.840
 as a catalog for the engineers of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.080
 aviation 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.150
 40 rows of shelves over 13 meters 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.769
 of height where all the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.290
 components that may need a 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.180
 Emirates fleet aircraft is chosen 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.830
 a piece covers the form and it 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.830
 Leave your delivery in the hands of the manager 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.440
 from the warehouse in these shelves there are more 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.330
 of 100,000 cardboard boxes all of them 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.640
 they have a code registered in the base 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.810
 that's why even the weirdest piece 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 appears in seconds 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.379
 the storekeeper takes the piece notes the 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.379
 order and delivery at the counter 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.980
 from there the piece will travel until 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.130
 one of the workshops either in a cart 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.020
 or express bike so that between 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.790
 the diagnosis of the problem and the delivery 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.790
 of the piece spend less than 10 minutes 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.070
 in important cases like in a 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.800
 check the rate review should be a 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.840
 slightly slower once the 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.790
 apparatus is scanned every inch of 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.430
 chassis looking for signs of fatigue in 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.680
 the metal 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.449
 the engineers place sensors in the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.970
 appliance coating to search 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.580
 defects 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 in technological analysis they are in charge 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.660
 to check the data screen and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.790
 decode the vibrations and in the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.550
 less technological hit the plane with 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.140
 a hammer any defect in the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.450
 fuselage will produce vibrations 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.730
 uneven that will appear as peaks in 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.770
 the portable scanner is a process 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.560
 laborious but the slightest fissure 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.330
 could cause a structural failure 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.010
 catastrophic if these men do not 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.310
 like the look of something can 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.990
 get rid of whole pieces of the device 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.910
 the fuselage of this device has received 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.590
 the approval but they will still pass 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.670
 weeks until he regains his seats 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.580
 and fly to the sky 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:11.840
 when it is in the air it will fly up to 16 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:14.810
 365 hours a day protect the lives of 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.420
 more than 22 million people that's 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.320
 many people and for that you need a 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.320
 piece of garage
