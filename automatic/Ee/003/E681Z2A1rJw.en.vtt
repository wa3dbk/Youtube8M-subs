00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
probably do not know before CG while I'm

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.540 
probably do not know before CG while I'm
driving<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.509> hard<00:00:15.690> drive<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.529> screwed<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.340 
driving the hard drive or not screwed in
leaving<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.300> loose<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.570> they<00:00:18.990> could<00:00:19.140> fall

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
leaving them loose and they could fall

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.429

out<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.710> any<00:00:19.830> given<00:00:20.100> moment<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.840> I<00:00:21.840> went

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
out at any given moment so I went

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.310 
out at any given moment so I went
through<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.100> stuff<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> hard

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
I said you're simply screwing and then I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.470 
I said you're simply screwing and then I
finally<00:00:31.769> got<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.340> screwed<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.180> feel<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
finally got them screwed in I feel it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.970 
finally got them screwed in I feel it
took<00:00:33.630> me<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.170> hour<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> figure<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.829> how

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
took me about an hour to figure out how

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
took me about an hour to figure out how
to<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.399> screwed<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.410> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to get them screwed in right because the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
to get them screwed in right because the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
court the IDE of court was not long

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.500 
court the IDE of court was not long
enough<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> worked<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> price<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
enough but it worked but the price and I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
enough but it worked but the price and I
was<00:00:42.629> using<00:00:42.960> these<00:00:43.079> tools<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.879> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
was using these tools you have to use a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
was using these tools you have to use a
wrench<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> little<00:00:46.170> screw<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
wrench to get a little screw out and the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
wrench to get a little screw out and the
destination<00:00:47.789> point<00:00:48.059> for<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.360> screw<00:00:48.629> put<00:00:49.559> too

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
destination point for this screw put too

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.209 
destination point for this screw put too
much<00:00:49.860> pressure<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.700> bent<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
much pressure on it so I bent it I

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
much pressure on it so I bent it I
unbent<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.629> played<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
unbent it played with it a little bit I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.130 
unbent it played with it a little bit I
got<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.949> fixed<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.699> bit<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.930> put

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.410 

I<00:03:00.560> hate<00:03:01.460> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.089 

yeah<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.450> got<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> lot<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.019> my<00:03:11.200> files<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.769> here<00:03:12.010> it

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
yeah I got a lot of my files on here it

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.580 
yeah I got a lot of my files on here it
had<00:03:12.280> Windows<00:03:12.700> 95<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> internet<00:03:14.409> would

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
had Windows 95 but the internet would

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:23.660 
had Windows 95 but the internet would
not<00:03:14.799> work<00:03:15.099> so<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.750> gave<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.870> an<00:03:16.989> upgrade<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.530> 98

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.470 

well<00:03:24.670> I'm<00:03:24.819> not<00:03:24.909> basically<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.659> for<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> IBM
