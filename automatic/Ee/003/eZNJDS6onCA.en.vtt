00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.910
 4 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 this year 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.599
 not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 the argentinian 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.029
 which are 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 It's very cool, I think. 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.779
 a little more 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.910
 The contract is so long here I'm going to enjoy it now 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.280
 All country 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 and pay for everything that happens 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 between January and August 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.420
 now i'm sorry 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.930
 carolina dieckmann 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.150
 it is 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 ae 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.300
 1 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.980
 not the 6 alexa 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.010
 1 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820
 would you like 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 again 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.759
 the logistical support 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.219
 ronaldo 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.469
 on the other hand not everyone calm 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.530
 and he promises 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.130
 nor it seems that you caution is very high to us here 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.120
 in this field 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 the project tries to apply cuts will want to go far 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.680
 the plant 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.610
 four years 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 the opposite 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 now 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 did not enter as a holder 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.590
 last year 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.200
 I stayed with her and after getting started 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.310
 the chosen sect 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.380
 because 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.890
 that's why it says 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.840
 And says 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.229
 Carlos Reyes 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.229
 it is 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.289
 if this suggestion lets start Thursday 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.799
 if we are in the pole position I like the ones that are here on another stage 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.629
 and according to the type of meeting 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.629
 the poor thing because time is nothing more than an enclosure 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:33.760
 here the announcement 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.259
 works like that proposed by the osklen group 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 So, how do I do this year? 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.619
 war 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.669
 but now 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:49.289
 in May the currency closed the lawsuit if it caught the conduct 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.009
 substitute of felipe melo 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.869
 14 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.939
 tonic and tinoco 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.939
 It's okay, because it was complicated. 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.409
 after OK 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.849
 bring 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.609
 of the night 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.499
 tonight 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.439
 not the banorte 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.759
 recently 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.879
 will be 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.279
 management 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.279
 they are neither 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.909
 it's not a question 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.049
 and how are they in it but before had to write 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.939
 This is very good here, we deny it by the Reuters 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.549
 in the called tax of the check 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.869
 We all prouni us 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.869
 in the next phase the block 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.579
 yes n 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.709
 how was 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.349
 I would say that today they are discussing 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.629
 he's special 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.680
 this 4 and triple in the context of crisis here 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.339
 is a group of three teams who opposed 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.340
 but here too 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.799
 raikkonen supritec have done more 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.799

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.729
 the client 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.729
 the team muller michelletti 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.249
 art 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.569
 here they are not even there 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.090
 the actor matt strawn and not enough 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.389
 in the last childbirth 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.240
 when we are sad yes 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 squares

 and even more the actions of the Orthodox Church 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.560
 and here I thought the club 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.669
 You have to do now is not to defeat mine there. 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.339
 because of the altitude I have a contract 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.949
 I do not care about skyline this thing that I'm good at 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.409
