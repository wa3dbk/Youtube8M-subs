00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.880
 I used lightroom 5 with enjoy photo life 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.780
 Low limit 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.650
 This picture is this time 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.660
 It is a night view 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.110
 The bridge is coming with the light and the light is with the panpan barn 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 Get up 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:36.250
 If it is reflected on the surface of the water and there is some green, when this picture is slightly adjusted this time 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.000
 I think thank would like to explain where say 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.360
 First of all 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 Now when I saw this photo 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:53.730
 The settings are being initialized, but when shooting , ç£¯ 400-20 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:58.650
 At the wide angle of 70 mm in 247 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:04.100
 It is a camera called d 810 of Nikon in 1.7 seconds in Bargu 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.100
 I went doing what is called by wire or mad at the mirror-up mode 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.430
 Even if it expands considerably when going 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 Sharp and almost no blur 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 Where it means 1.7 seconds Garugu' 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.100
 2 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.100
 The new function, electric curtain shutter, is an e-prize that can be used 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.530
 Let's fine-tune this part of the shot this time 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.390
 I'm talking of the ride and say 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.770
 For example, with clipping now 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.050
 Such places will only warn you of the highlights 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.470
 In this regard 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.000
 This time is that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.080
 There is a point that we narrow down to the f number and do it 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 To the point of flare called there 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 that 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:02.479
 When I saw the whole not a problem 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.479
 So, while focusing on texture, I think it will be in the range of fine adjustment 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:15.540
 It is the lower part of the bridge 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.270
 Part of the reflection in the part of the light so that the start point and the end point will gather here 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.110
 I want to work 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:27.460
 It is said that 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:29.280
 The lens is the distortion of Yes You're the wound of the bobbin side of the slightly telephoto side is a little 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:34.400
 Make corrections 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.400
 It will improve at once if you eliminate it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.960
 In such a case, I think it is quite good to use profile correction 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:49.260
 It feels like saying to here 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.870
 It's a story that I want to tighten that whole more 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.629
 I will raise the contrast a little 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.629
 Just a little and raise the exposure a little 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.620
 Exposure is +0 points 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.620
 About 21 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.110
 Then a little light will continue to out rampage pretty 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.990
 In this state 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.410
 With people like you are good when you stop again at this 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.410
 It is a story 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.660
 With a clipping 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.790
 It's a feeling of going wild a little 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.280
 After all the highlights are cut off 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.430
 This is already 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:41.099
 It really remains about -10 a little 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.099
 I think I get you to repair about this 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.490
 It has improved quite well 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.130
 When 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.130
 Only this time is the day situation 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.470
 I wonder if I can not clean this bridge a little more 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.470
 I thought now 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.569
 When 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:09.049
 At that time, the white balance is automatically applied once at a time. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.049
 Then 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:20.400
 White balance almost the same as when shooting, but the individuality of the color cast is plus 30 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.400
 It was like killing a better at the time of suffering and have you ne little shooting 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.830
 To the fact that 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.430
 Dow a little closer to the fluorescent lamp 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.110
 By the way, set the color temperature 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.110
 I 'll bring it to you 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.910
 I do not like it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.990
 I think that in the feeling that returns to the shooting may white balance is try to experiment 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.729
 For example 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.729
 It will be like this if you go up, it will already be like it going down 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.940
 This time I took 5050 when I took it 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.840
 Maybe this is about 5500 in the middle 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.020
 After all're wearing kinda 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.630
 5050 and then to a place called custom in 4800 after all from 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:27.900
 I like this most White balance 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.900
 Since regarding to become another little piece to this woman 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.630
 I think I should make my own favorite picture 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.620
 In a 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.600
 Check the whole now 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.600
 I come in the house Toka of color at the green I kind of can exert shoe 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:52.979
 In the whole picture 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:56.940
 It does not matter, so reducing this noise will quickly lose that other detail. 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:06:00.290
 Is it better to stop it? 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.290
 It is a feeling of experience 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.220
 It has improved 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:10.720
 This is really fine adjustment this time 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:13.510
 It is this state that initializes 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.030
 Almost now 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.590
 Saying doing just as it is in this atmosphere 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.590
 In the end even fine adjustment 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:32.000
 It's like getting closer to your own ideal meeting 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:35.780
 It will be commentary We plan to continue to enhance the content about Logen elephant in the future 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.050
 Enjoy photo life Thank you for who was coming to see to the end 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.050
 By car
