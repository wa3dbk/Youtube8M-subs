00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.650
 little everything can not be sweet and nothing 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.570
 I'm going to present the ingredients to you 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.699
 basic ingredients let's catch me 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.260
 I will explain for two people depends 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.350
 also what you eat two people but 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.570
 As a general rule, we are going to take a 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.940
 piece of pumpkin a quarter of this 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.060
 size more or less after we're going to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.650
 throw six or seven carrots 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.650
 with potatoes of this size 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.610
 a large onion or a smaller one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.740
 another bigger one also depends everything 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 of taste the same happened with the carrot 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.320
 and the pumpkin we can throw more than one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.020
 more of the other as we want 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.490
 the spices then a little salt 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 black pepper nutmeg and oil 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.260
 olive 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.530
 once we have everything done we are going 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.229
 to add three cheeses there are people who 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.960
 I prefer cream I 've always made cheese 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.299
 the brand you want as I said 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 and then to accompany the cream of each 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.280
 ounce was I'm going to put toast 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 but we can throw fried bread those who 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 are looking at the stomach I can not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.830
 because gabi the poor and if I can not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.930
 lock me up so good is this worth 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.759
 it's all going to it good at first 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.610
 place we are going to peel all the vegetables and the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 we are going to wipe very well and afterwards the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 chop 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.570
 for carrots and we have a peeler 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.790
 of vegetables so perfect if you can not 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.880
 to work it as I am doing 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.930
 that also stays completely so much 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.930
 for a board like 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 Well, all peeled now we are going to 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.830
 pay it well and atrocious 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.269
 once everything is washed we are going to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'll start with the onion 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.569
 that the first thing we're going to stir 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.980
 it does not have to be too small 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.980
 everything is going to boil then 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.480
 ah 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.270
 in a normal size when cutting 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.670
 the potato we put the knife until the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.470
 half a little and we pull towards 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.360
 upstairs that the sek club had 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.310
 listened to sme a trick that taught me 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.910
 my mother for the time to know what 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.910
 it got better 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.870
 well then once we have all 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.370
 the chopped vegetables are going to sauté a 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.070
 little onion first thing we go 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.810
 to do for it we are going to cover the base 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.810
 pot olive oil 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.489
 not much 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.230
 we cover the base well 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.230
 and we put it on fire to heat 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.010
 we put it to minimum fire not because to 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.269
 sauté the onion and let's hope 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.269
 hot a little 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.610
 once we have the warm oil 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.610
 then we throw the onion 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.770
 sauté a little and a pinch of salt 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.770
 so that I can take gustito 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.049
 we are moving that I do not know I do not know 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.199
 like the rest of the vegetables and we throw it 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.199
 the pot 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.090
 when the onion is a bit 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.360
 they mix everything 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.669
 and we cover everything nothing 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.760
 I'm going to use this to make it more 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.760
 Quick 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.090
 it's worth the amount of love to simply 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.090
 cover all vegetables 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.640
 you see how everything is covered with water 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.010
 Well that's how it has to be 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.540
 then the amount of vegetable depends 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.650
 that you throw is the amount of water that 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.500
 you will have to use move 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.250
 and let it boil and then look at this 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.250
 it has started to boil 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.900
 now we leave it 20 more minutes that is 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.900
 all the soft vegetables to beat it 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.490
 we cover and as I said 20 minutes 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.760
 and it's so easy that we put out the fire 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.830
 and we're going to beat it to beat it 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.310
 because all the carbon 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.510
 I do not have a good time 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:04.040
 we already throw a handful of salt 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.040
 with a little black pepper 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.210
 the species something that is the taste site 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.280
 much more spicy minor and a little bit of 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.310
 nutmeg 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.790
 we add the three cheeses and 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.790
 knock them down 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.270
 here 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.480
 that's how everything has to be very 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.480
 well beaten 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 Now I'm going to prepare the dishes and eat 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.290
 Meat is the cream of pumpkin and 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.590
 carrot we do not make take as first 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.590
 plate 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.379
 accompanied by toast as I said 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:53.849
 before or drumsticks fried egg nato 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:53.849
 chopped like more crop 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.840
 or we can not take it as a sauce 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.950
 for example here I made two 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.950
 chicken burgers rice 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.179
 we can accompany it with cream 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:12.569
 pumpkin and also the two are very 

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:12.569
 good ones 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.590
 and it 's in the result, well, guys 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.810
 I hope you liked that you try 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:23.280
 at home and nothing like that there is already hunger 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.280
 very useful and be next
