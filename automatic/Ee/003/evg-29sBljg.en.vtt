it<00:02:33.380> do<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.800> little<00:02:34.160> by<00:02:34.250> little<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.819> can't

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
it do it little by little you just can't

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.460 
it do it little by little you just can't
take<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.209> razor<00:02:35.420> blade<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.780> cut<00:02:36.110> all<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.410> way

take a razor blade and cut all the way

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.759 
take a razor blade and cut all the way
down<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.849> mm<00:02:38.569> being<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.380> don't<00:02:39.620> have

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
down so mm being that I don't have

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.160 
down so mm being that I don't have
instructions<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.480> far<00:02:41.750> looks<00:02:41.959> pretty

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
instructions so far looks pretty

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.199 
instructions so far looks pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:42.819> it's<00:02:43.819> got<00:02:43.940> these<00:02:44.060> little

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
self-explanatory it's got these little

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.330 
self-explanatory it's got these little
mounting<00:02:44.660> plates<00:02:44.930> which<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:45.860> up<00:02:45.980> against<00:02:46.280> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
mounting plates which go up against the

mounting plates which go up against the
boat<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.130> things<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.810> see<00:02:50.989> it's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
boat and then these things you see it's

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.990 
boat and then these things you see it's
this<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.220> piece<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.580> actually<00:02:52.850> goes

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
this is the the piece that actually goes

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.199 
this is the the piece that actually goes
to<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.239> bars<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:54.769> looks<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.850> like<00:02:56.030> that

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
to the bars this looks of it like that

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.420 
to the bars this looks of it like that
and<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.600> holds<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.170> hole<00:02:57.430> through

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
and this holds it to the hole through

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.150 
and this holds it to the hole through
these<00:02:58.610> little<00:02:59.769> what<00:03:00.769> do<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.860> call<00:03:01.040> them

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
these little what do you call them

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.350 
these little what do you call them
little<00:03:01.819> gaskets<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.650> far<00:03:04.030> not<00:03:05.030> too<00:03:05.209> bad

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
little gaskets so so far not too bad

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.620 
little gaskets so so far not too bad
looking<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:06.799> kind<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:07.670> worry<00:03:07.880> about<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.540> know

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
looking I kind of worry about you know

looking I kind of worry about you know
four<00:03:08.930> little<00:03:09.140> bolts<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.799> holding<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
four little bolts like that holding it

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.589 
four little bolts like that holding it
but<00:03:10.459> they've<00:03:10.580> got<00:03:10.730> these<00:03:10.849> little<00:03:10.910> back<00:03:11.239> plates

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.479 
but they've got these little back plates
and<00:03:11.900> then<00:03:12.410> I'm<00:03:12.500> actually<00:03:12.680> gonna<00:03:12.920> use<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> piece

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and then I'm actually gonna use a piece

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.420 
and then I'm actually gonna use a piece
of<00:03:13.519> wood<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.060> backside<00:03:14.480> also<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:16.280> hold

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
of wood on the backside also to to hold

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.310 
of wood on the backside also to to hold
it<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.030> far<00:03:20.060> obviously<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.140> see

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
it so that's it so far obviously you see

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
don't know if I mentioned this before

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.509 
don't know if I mentioned this before
but<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:35.060> shop<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.600> truck<00:03:35.989> had<00:03:36.920> some<00:03:37.100> problems

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
but the shop the truck had some problems

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.449 
but the shop the truck had some problems
and<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.410> take<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.069> get<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.280> all

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
and I have to take it in and get it all

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.770 
and I have to take it in and get it all
worked<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.880> I've<00:03:41.180> been<00:03:41.209> putting<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.600> off<00:03:41.720> for

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
worked on I've been putting it off for

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.870 
worked on I've been putting it off for
probably<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.769> don't<00:03:43.040> know<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> month<00:03:43.549> month<00:03:43.730> and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
probably I don't know a month month and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.180 
probably I don't know a month month and
a<00:03:43.970> half<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.840> had<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.260> pop<00:03:45.530> in<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.799> front<00:03:46.040> end<00:03:46.160> that

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
a half I had a pop in the front end that

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.009 
a half I had a pop in the front end that
was<00:03:46.340> going<00:03:46.579> bang<00:03:46.880> bang<00:03:47.299> every<00:03:47.630> time<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.870> turn

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
was going bang bang every time you turn

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:48.759 
was going bang bang every time you turn
right<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.380> left

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
right or left

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.979 
right or left
and<00:03:48.889> so<00:03:49.639> I<00:03:49.670> was<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.090> okay<00:03:50.329> what's<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.720> well

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
and so I was like okay what's that well

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.800 
and so I was like okay what's that well
it<00:03:51.109> turns<00:03:51.290> out<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.530> be<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.650> cab<00:03:51.920> isolator<00:03:52.810> which

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it turns out to be a cab isolator which

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.349 
it turns out to be a cab isolator which
the<00:03:54.019> front<00:03:54.260> cab<00:03:54.739> mount<00:03:55.100> apparently<00:03:56.000> sheared

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
the front cab mount apparently sheared

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.809 
the front cab mount apparently sheared
off<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.560> cab<00:03:57.769> was<00:03:57.950> popping<00:03:58.459> as<00:03:58.639> you

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
off and so the cab was popping as you

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.840 
off and so the cab was popping as you
turn<00:03:59.090> two<00:03:59.209> corners<00:03:59.829> so<00:04:00.829> they're<00:04:01.400> fixing<00:04:01.730> that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
turn two corners so they're fixing that

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.370 
turn two corners so they're fixing that
plus<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.359> power<00:04:02.510> steering<00:04:02.780> pump<00:04:02.900> was<00:04:03.170> giving

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
plus the power steering pump was giving

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.289 
plus the power steering pump was giving
me<00:04:03.440> problems<00:04:03.650> when<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.160> turn<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.670> lock<00:04:04.850> up<00:04:05.090> on

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
me problems when you turn and lock up on

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.009 
me problems when you turn and lock up on
you

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
you

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.349 
you
I<00:04:06.079> needed<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.709> transmission<00:04:07.130> service<00:04:07.670> needed

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
I needed a transmission service needed

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.910 
I needed a transmission service needed

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
the external filter being it's a diesel

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.410 
the external filter being it's a diesel
it<00:04:10.040> had<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.280> have<00:04:10.370> an<00:04:10.459> external<00:04:10.700> filter<00:04:11.120> put<00:04:11.299> on

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
it had to have an external filter put on

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.490 
it had to have an external filter put on
it

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500

so also all changed so probably $500

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.460
