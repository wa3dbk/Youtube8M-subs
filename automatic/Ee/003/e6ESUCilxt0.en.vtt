 person explained martín and is coming 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.860

 with quique in the collar hello as they are 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.779
 I am in a day in the face or let's make up 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.640
 Today my only dog and my cat are with me 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.470
 martín and he is not very happy is 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.650
 desperate because he wants me to let him go 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.980
 to continue exploring here in the courtyard 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.980
 from my house 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.520
 and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350
 or not 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 note 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.510
 how 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.380
 from my maternal grandfather I learned a lot 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 things among them the ones that I love them 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.390
 share in this video is used to heal 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 the wounds of street animals and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.090
 I also saw animals as 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 healthy valdés disease that they 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 it hits the skin that is like a dermatitis 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.110
 and they're commonly called scabies and it's about 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 to use the sulfur powder and he 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
 I used bait but you can also 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.710
 use for example oil juice water 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.229
 olive oil that can save you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 money when maybe there is some 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.630
 accident in your house with your pet and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.210
 you can use it to help you 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.190
 some wound comes out faster and it does not 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 infected a few months ago when I 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.170
 I moved to this house tequila my black cat 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.820
 he is very stressful he does not like 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 changes and of course it was not the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.080
 exception this time that we moved from 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.149
 Again the tailor knew he did not want to play 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.070
 I did not want to do anything and Martin and how is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.130
 a younger kitten and has a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.050
 Wolf's most jovial personality is more 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.210
 crazy because all the time I wanted to be 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.729
 playing for him was like a fun 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 be in a new place and on one occasion 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.290
 of tequila attacked him very ugly because 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.160
 Martin insisted on wanting to play 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.380
 with him and in less than two days he fell 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.230
 his hair and he was forming something very 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 ugly on his face economically he did not have 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.030
 the money to go to a veterinarian because 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 here is very expensive then I remembered the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.730
 remedy my grandfather and I put it into practice 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.680
 for the first time in my pets and I was 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.160
 very good so I want to share 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.350
 some pictures of how the king looked 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.500
 and when he had the infection of the meeting 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.390
 that left me tequila and what you should use 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.000
 and how can you use it 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.150
 he scratch got infected the first two 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.300
 days and this was mainly because 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.330
 martín and he was scratching a lot like that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.030
 that I decided to put a thick plastic on 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.300
 the head to prevent it from being 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.740
 scratching and mistreating the wound after 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.140
 of eight days the wound healed dry and I could 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.020
 remove the bothersome plastic that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.440
 had in his head indicated he's going to serve 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.290
 my model suppose that he has a 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.989
 wound in the middle of his fingers here in 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.090
 the talks it is important that you clean 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.700
 the area and please do not do it with 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.790
 alcohol what horror use water 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.519
 oxygenated then and this you do it every time 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.980
 that you are going to apply the remedy then 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.320
 after cleaning it what you do is that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.260
 you are going to apply some of the oil 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.980
 jojoba or tallow sebum also what 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.650
 you can find in health food stores 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.079
 they sell tallow candles then 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.190
 you apply a little bit a little without going to 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.490
 touch the area connected with the oil 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.220
 and after you 've applied the oil or 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:58.270
 the bait you are going to apply he 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.600
 the sulfur and the way I do it 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.260
 is that I take a little cup or a stick 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.260
 cleansed 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.870
 and accumulated a little bit of dust that I 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.630
 I was going to use the model and you did not 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.920
 left and here as a little bit in the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.160
 cane d 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.130
 the sulfur and what I do is that then what 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.130
 deposited on the wound 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.970
 this does need more sulfur or oil 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.740
 always going to use a clean glass and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.280
 I will never touch the area so I do not 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.770
 pollute nor the sulfur 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.350
 oil or olive oil 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.070
 jojoba ready you do not have any 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.500
 worry if your dog or cat maybe 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.040
 lick the area and have the bait or the 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.380
 olive oil and sulfur this is not 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.930
 toxic but the ideal is that they do not 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.570
 They are in contact with the area to the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.820
 are licking or scratching and it's not because 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.480
 be toxic or harmful to them is 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.820
 because that tends to hurt them a bit 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.300
 more the flour and it will take more time in 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.860
 heal in baby I'll pay with a 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.860
 cookie looks like a coconut 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.140
 limping car 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.320
 as you could see is something that is very 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.230
 easy and economical sulfur regularly 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.830
 they sell it in health food stores in 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.270
 botanicals and jojoba oil is something 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.030
 that you can also buy in stores 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.130
 naturists if you do not find the oil of 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.950
 soybean you can use maybe the oil 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.740
 Olive although note that Martin was 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.000
 the jojoba oil worked better 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.430
 says that jova's oil has 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.170
 special properties to help 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.470
 eliminate bacteria but it also 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.270
 used for acne so this is 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.180
 something that you can use when 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.340
 soon there is a small wound meeting in 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.990
 your cats or your dogs and what of 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.330
 soon there is no need to go to a 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.280
 veterinarian or I'm not saying this 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.430
 can be used in very serious wounds 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.340
 it is important then to take into account and 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:11.340
 how to judge the situation properly 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.960
 so later we do not suddenly regret 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.110
 for not having made the right decision 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.680
 this is something for small wounds or 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.350
 for allergic reactions you can also 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.350
 be something very good but if you notice that your 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.180
 dog or your cat does not improve and the wound 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.130
 grows or notes that it is being 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.120
 infecting more then the best would be 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:37.490
 visit the vet so I hope 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.490
 You liked this video and it's gone 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.560
 because we are
