you have any gas blowback and that would

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.780 
you have any gas blowback and that would
be<00:03:48.340> for<00:03:48.610> my<00:03:48.790> gauge<00:03:49.060> AWG<00:03:49.500> 23<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
be for my gauge AWG 23 so this is the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.240 
be for my gauge AWG 23 so this is the
main<00:03:51.940> compartment<00:03:52.269> here<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.079> this<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
main compartment here and this is the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.420 
main compartment here and this is the
flat<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.360> gun<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.739> first<00:03:57.160> I'm<00:03:57.400> just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
flat for the gun but first I'm just

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.039 
flat for the gun but first I'm just
going<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.730> show<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> how<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.630> set<00:03:58.780> up

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
going to show you how I have it set up

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.199 
going to show you how I have it set up
so<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.709> back<00:03:59.920> end<00:03:59.980> would<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.430> towards<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
so the back end would be towards the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.680 
so the back end would be towards the
wheels<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.350> when<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.829> lift<00:04:03.609> up<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> bag<00:04:04.090> all<00:04:04.630> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
wheels so when I lift up the bag all the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.210 
wheels so when I lift up the bag all the
pressure<00:04:05.049> would<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.320> on<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.530> stock<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:05.829> not

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
pressure would be on the stock and not

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.699 
pressure would be on the stock and not
on<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.730> flash<00:04:07.570> hider<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.380> front<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
on the flash hider in the front of the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:17.900 
on the flash hider in the front of the
gun<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:09.850> go<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.090> this

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.580 

and<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.060> way<00:04:19.239> your<00:04:19.720> gun<00:04:20.110> does<00:04:20.290> not<00:04:20.320> get

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
and that way your gun does not get

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.530 
and that way your gun does not get
scratched<00:04:20.799> by<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> rest<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.459> your<00:04:21.549> year<00:04:21.760> the

scratched by the rest of your year the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
scratched by the rest of your year the
first<00:04:22.780> thing<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.050> put<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.380> main

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
first thing I put in the main

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.830 
first thing I put in the main
