crap<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.209> broken<00:01:54.130> Hasbro<00:01:55.130> uses<00:01:55.489> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
crap it broken Hasbro uses the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.760 
crap it broken Hasbro uses the
properties<00:01:55.849> they<00:01:56.270> own<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.840> apply<00:01:57.289> them<00:01:57.560> to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
properties they own and apply them to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.070 
properties they own and apply them to
this<00:01:57.950> real<00:01:58.220> formula<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.179> look<00:01:59.390> at<00:01:59.539> how<00:01:59.660> Lego

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
this real formula so look at how Lego

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.550 
this real formula so look at how Lego
has<00:02:00.289> patent<00:02:00.979> or<00:02:01.340> Star<00:02:01.640> Wars

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
has patent or Star Wars

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.499 
has patent or Star Wars
exactly<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.770> Hasbro's<00:02:04.280> answer<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.789> that<00:02:04.940> is

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
exactly so Hasbro's answer to that is

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.630 
exactly so Hasbro's answer to that is
releasing<00:02:05.929> transformers<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:07.039> GI<00:02:07.160> Joe

this<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.620> may<00:02:49.130> be<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.310> little<00:02:49.610> harder<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.000> come

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
this one may be a little harder to come

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.350
