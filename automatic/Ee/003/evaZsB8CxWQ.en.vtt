 until 11 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.910
 but it's in every art with last season's feature films 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 original cartridges 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.770
 Over long distances viewers have said it as fairest StarTrek lives it lives 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 Truthfulness and that for over 20 years 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.630
 Lala Jacek I would like to take you on a journey into the past 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.050
 Take away at a time when the enterprise-class Brunsbrock that one only 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.160
 an idea in my mind was "travelers back to the roots of 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.310
 Storck way to the very first pilot film the function of a pilot film is the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.390
 To give television broadcasters an impression of a new series St der 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.780
 60-minute pilot by StarCraft is now a piece of television history 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.360
 which is at least as exciting as the following production explained 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 Böttcher Sprinter 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.440
 and if he was briefly the television station of the very first pilot, however 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.260
 little enthusiastic and rejected him by therefore the original version was up 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.540
 Never shown on TV before today Her title was the cage 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.740
 Auerbach 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.729
 Montella he ended his world over the 1 she starts on the bridge of 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.759
 Enterprise was her commander Christopher Feick played by the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.770
 by now deceased Geoffrey Hampson horror shocker 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 The Tehran's boss was able to watch television at that time mainly 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.039
 delight in western stories 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.589
 and to make my series palatable I told that it was about 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.759
 acted a Western in space 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.839
 to kind of contribute track to the stars now radiating Pistons Pedro 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:22.059
 álvarez and spaceships become stony coach when writing scripts I noticed 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.519
 that I had a dramatic story to tell too 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.459
 Most science fiction films I knew in Kiel a bad 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.939
 he characterized characters without any motivation hall for 16 years 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.069
 old or which 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.009
 At the moment, that's what I thought when I removed the characters from my series 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.749
 Planets sends now I could easily address topics like Bobbi 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.969
 Bear Creek Health Food Check scans and all the things that life for us so 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.919
 make exciting 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.709
 I assumed that my concept would be considered foreign in Turkish 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.679
 Follow up on these topics 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.189
 instead of bringing his space western I could turn into a completely 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.189
 different story 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.049
 because I think she acted by the driven by the power of 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.619
 Thoughts can arise 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.869
 from the question what would be if someone could achieve it only by the desired 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:28.079
 Forces the illusion to create whole worlds h 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.239

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.229
 Mr. m 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:43.059
 Adults Adults starting another stumbling block was me 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.829
 Woman had made Deputy Commander as women in 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.120
 Leadership positions unthinkable this woman in the film by Elke Werry clarified 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.739
 Price was characterized by extraordinary intelligence but 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.590
 almost always concludes that occur from source 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.219
 In the city it would be different than expected, the women from ours 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.320
 Festive audience not at all affected by this figure 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.679
 your comment

 Karin Höller 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 Dr 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.999
 when he was in a corner and there was a figure that was not even more human 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.699
 an alien 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.370
 who looked like the devil Satan he had even pointed ears 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.249
 I beat even more about the strings 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.569
 For example, no one on board the spaceship can be seen with one 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.379
 Cigarette in the mouth and that although advertising at that time was the key to the 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.949
 profitable evaluation of all series truth not much i refused 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.429
 to assemble the crew reasonably 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.539
 elegant description for exclusively white represent 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.560
 some of the studio bosses were not thrilled when they got the finished movie 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.990
 They saw that they had invested a lot of money in the project and got it from me 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.990
 but by no means theirs on space western 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.240
 that none of the top bosses but was impressed for my movie 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.460
 because he got the feeling that he was really flying through space 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.380
 something very rare would happen 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.350
 they gave a second pilot for the job but this time he had to 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.030
 it's funny that it would be me otherwise 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.669
 once a family ech me wishes 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.770

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.770
 Hameln 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.210
 an improved so represented was a second pilot for his time this time 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:36.349
 Satisfied with it and the West German is there bears history 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.280
 to the story Flavors change the economic constraints remain however 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.069
 as soon as she was filming the money was running out 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.909
 so we bedded the first pilot into a new story with the 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.300
 Title Carlos 4 taboo 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.030
 he was not printed with Pepe Christof ob old and together 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.099
 learns of his tragic fate 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.919
 Examples Consequences of the film version alternate colored or 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.610
 black and white scenes a the colored scenes come from the later 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.020
 The black and white doubles are then left over from the first one 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.930
 Pilot project 18 she now history is good never got to face 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.919
 where the radiated pilot film stole the cage
