00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.690
 Now I want to give you the most important 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 Reveals of conductor 5 show and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.620
 Although I go here to develop module 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.629
 and here i want to develop a module 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 scroll down and down to the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.280
 lens correction so I go here 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.080
 I minimize a little more space 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.400
 me the histogram because here in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.720
 lens correction is now one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 get a new update 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.710
 I can now with the feature 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 upgrade very fast and easy photos 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 The warped are simply by the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.469
 perspective 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.090
 with a click on automatic to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 just align example 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 i can also say okay i want her 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 now only in the plane have corrected 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 Vertical of the finish line vertical 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 corrected or fully what in this 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 probably not such a good case 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 Result is so I go back 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 on automatic another very nice 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840
 feature is now the editing of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.940
 problem 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 if I sum up now and this one 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 flagpole wants to get away then can 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.719
 I now with the area repair 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.149
 Brush tool here on this area 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.590
 click and paint with the one and one 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.659
 looks like a whole now 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 can open the area and the line 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.890
 for me this area with the beautiful 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 So the area he is working sets 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.970
 So this possibility is really 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 very exciting where to save 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.040
 So that really is the way to photoshop 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.550
 So I can do it very fast 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.520
 eliminate problems 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.800
 another innovation that now with the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.350
 History filter is related to 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.300
 radial gradient filter this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.460
 works much like the normal one 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 History filter is but of the form 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.840
 of course, otherwise circular that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.850
 If I emphasize an area now 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.650
 I will take the example here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.810
 these areas behind and pull one 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.880
 ellipse on then you can see how up to date 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.010
 set is that the outer area 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.960
 in the exposure brighter to be 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.030
 But now I can say good 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.320
 would like to have the outer portion darker 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 or of course I can say that too 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.650
 I would like to have the inner areas 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.170
 Now go with the exposure once 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.700
 move up and say mask turn around 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.050
 now the inner area 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.850
 correspondingly lighter 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.800
 Of course I can do more now 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.240
 make adjustments like the masks 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.010
 for example, adjusting the edge 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.470
 I 'm doing something a little softer and softer 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.750
 position here these radials 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.670
 History filter a little new compasses 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 still worth here pointing down 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.730
 yes I would like the saturation accordingly 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.519
 to adjust 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.769
 in something like that and the deep one more 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.870
 can lighten a little more and can do that now 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.659
 so according to very fast directly 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.610
 Apply this to a certain point 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.530
 radio start off filter can now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.319
 of course, use one too 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.340
 vignetting right where to build 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.230
 I would like to have her 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.319
 I'll make this one myself now 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.269
 filter before saying that the mask 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.720
 should be reversed and the outer 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.900
 darkened area away 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.060
 namely so and now I can the size 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.690
 adjust this filter accordingly 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.000
 I'll go out here like this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.610
 the now in accordance with the size 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.600
 and say how strong this darkening 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.340
 should be outside 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.900
 I say a little darker 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.360
 and here in this area to 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.790
 example so i can do it very fast and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.540
 Just focus in one picture on one 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.730
 set up a certain picture position resp 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.219
 adjust the problem areas in the picture 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.870
 when working with mobile devices there 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.209
 it really is a novelty 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.590
 is unbeatable for me and I have 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.629
 I now the possibility if I am with 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.180
 an external disk works and 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.799
 my data on external hard drives 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 I save that for the individual 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.719
 Pictures not only an original photo 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.510
 can create but here 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.780
 Click on it to draw a smart picture 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.689
 say okay and now we for this one 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.389
 picture that is not yet local 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.579
 Smartphone created and the pleasant 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.870
 these smartphones now if 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.030
 it this picture on an external 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.889
 hard disk I'm lying my mobile 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.049
 Calculator now stake out on the way 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.510
 I would like to continue working with data 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.849
 the smart previews contain this 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.250
 picture also still develop though 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.900
 I do not have the picture with me 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.030
 the smart previews enable me 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.680
 now a very very flexible work 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.539
 also on the way and I can 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.729
 on the move also in the developed module 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.500
 continue to work and my creativity 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.599
 let free rein 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.039
 So this possibility of smart 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.590
 looking forward is really very much 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.050
 interesting and that is as I said for 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.380
 me one of the really great features 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.389
 to work with lightroom yes and daniel 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.340
 Besides these great features, there are 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.590
 Of course a lot of small ones 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.050
 features small innovations that are easy 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.639
 living or working with leaders 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.190
 to accelerate a lot 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.590
 just at work with collections 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.360
 There are so very little tips and 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.159
 They really just tricks the workflow 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.110
 accelerate that is sometimes easy 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.639
 only a small checkbox where to go 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.620
 example can say if I am now 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.960
 Create a new collection then 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.780
 this new collection immediately to the collection 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.560
 will confirm that once with 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.479
 create 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.460
 You can see this newly created collection 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.590
 is my goals collection and now you can 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.599
 I just directly with the pictures 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.030
 click on this round 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.470
 or just press the button b to the destination 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.110
 Add collection 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.930
 that is a small thing but that 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.940
 life or everyday life and work with 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.940
 really accelerate lightroom tremendously
