and<00:01:13.020> range<00:01:13.259> know<00:01:14.160> their<00:01:14.430> purpose<00:01:14.670> changes

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and range know their purpose changes

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
and range know their purpose changes
depending<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.690> what<00:01:15.869> effective<00:01:16.259> got<00:01:16.410> selected
