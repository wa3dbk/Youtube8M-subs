channel<00:02:14.580> point<00:02:14.940> idea<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.540> guess<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.260> worth

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
channel point idea but guess it's worth

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.180 
channel point idea but guess it's worth
it<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.840> brother<00:02:19.110> hunter<00:02:19.380> came<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.100> with

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
it then my brother hunter came up with

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.030 
it then my brother hunter came up with
the<00:02:20.280> idea<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.820> take<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> wagon<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.800> plastic

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.430 
wagon and cut the frame off on the
bottom<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.280> don't<00:02:26.430> have<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> wheels
