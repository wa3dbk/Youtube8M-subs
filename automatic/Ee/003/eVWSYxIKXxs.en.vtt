00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.000 
they're almost always worn out and this
is<00:02:58.549> why<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:58.940> will<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.380> attach<00:03:00.380> good<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.739> have

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
one that the lid would stay on so it's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.880 
one that the lid would stay on so it's
very<00:03:07.400> common<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.269> them<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.170> be<00:03:09.290> worn<00:03:09.530> out<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.860> I
