shooting<00:00:43.800> Alex<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> two<00:00:44.579> key<00:00:44.820> stats<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.149> did

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
shooting Alex in a two key stats I did

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
shooting Alex in a two key stats I did
mention<00:00:45.450> before<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:46.020> ridiculous<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
mention before that's ridiculous and I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.130 
mention before that's ridiculous and I
do<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:47.879> may<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> expensive

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
do think he may not be that expensive

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
do think he may not be that expensive
because<00:00:49.559> if<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:49.950> base<00:00:50.129> fee<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.610> teens<00:00:50.850> prices

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because if he base fee for teens prices

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
because if he base fee for teens prices

on silver cards they really weren't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.740 
on silver cards they really weren't
worth<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.550> might<00:00:53.760> show<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.030> depends<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
worth to might show it depends what the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600
