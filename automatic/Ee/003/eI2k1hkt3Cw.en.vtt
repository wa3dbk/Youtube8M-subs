00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
probably going to wipe off any that you

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.480 
probably going to wipe off any that you
got<00:04:27.220> on<00:04:27.400> enfold<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:30.390> had<00:04:31.390> some<00:04:31.660> here<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:33.370> that

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
got on enfold I had some here and that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:42.450 
got on enfold I had some here and that
wiped<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:33.880> off<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.530> color<00:04:41.770> wasn't<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.220> perfect

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
wiped it off this color wasn't a perfect

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.370 
wiped it off this color wasn't a perfect
match<00:04:42.820> or<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:43.360> wouldn't<00:04:43.660> have<00:04:43.840> this<00:04:44.080> this

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
match or we wouldn't have this this

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.840 
match or we wouldn't have this this
would<00:04:44.560> even<00:04:44.680> be<00:04:44.830> filled<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.610> still

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
would even be filled in but I still

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.390 
would even be filled in but I still
think<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.090> looks<00:04:46.330> better<00:04:46.510> than<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.750> did<00:04:47.400> so

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
think that looks better than it did so

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:59.730 
think that looks better than it did so
I'm<00:04:48.490> not<00:04:48.580> going<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.790> worry<00:04:48.940> about<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:59.500> is

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
I'm not going to worry about it that is

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.150 
I'm not going to worry about it that is
it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
it

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.600 
it
there's<00:05:00.850> your<00:05:01.000> finish<00:05:01.270> too
