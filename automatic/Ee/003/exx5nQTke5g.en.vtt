able to map may be able to zoom in on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.510 
able to map may be able to zoom in on
the<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> specific<00:01:01.530> location<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> map<00:01:02.190> and

then be able to zoom out and see more of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
then be able to zoom out and see more of
the<00:01:05.729> place<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.600> basically<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.290> works<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the place so basically how it works is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.469 
the place so basically how it works is
like<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.610> quite<00:01:08.790> sure<00:01:08.820> how<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.030> work

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like I'm not quite sure how this work

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
like I'm not quite sure how this work
but<00:01:09.750> i<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
but i think it is that first when you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.230 
but i think it is that first when you
like<00:01:12.299> make<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> new<00:01:12.869> map<00:01:13.460> yeah<00:01:14.460> making<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.030> mad

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
like make a new map yeah making you mad

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
like make a new map yeah making you mad
then<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.380> crafting<00:01:16.619> somewhere<00:01:17.340> then

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
then you start crafting somewhere then

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.859 
then you start crafting somewhere then
that<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.320> centered<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.490> map<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that will be centered in the map that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
that will be centered in the map that
were<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.320> start<00:01:22.619> coughing<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
were you start coughing it and the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
were you start coughing it and the
basically<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.530> sort

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
basically is then when you like sort

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070 
basically is then when you like sort

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
real map so that's kind of cool hey you
can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:40.079> two<00:01:40.320> pictures<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.829> can

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
can see to put two pictures you can

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.399 
can see to put two pictures you can
first<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> soon<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.110> then

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
first see the soon out one here and then

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
first see the soon out one here and then
you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.920> zoomed<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> always

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you can see it zoomed in here is always

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.030 
you can see it zoomed in here is always
good<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> assume<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
good to assume then if you have like a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.999 
good to assume then if you have like a
place<00:01:47.430> area<00:01:47.939> where<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:49.170> team<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.890> know

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
place area where your team is you know

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
place area where your team is you know
where<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.520> hiding<00:01:50.729> from<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.930> evil<00:01:52.200> people

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
where you're hiding from the evil people

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
where you're hiding from the evil people
but<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> cool<00:01:54.030> ah<00:01:54.390> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
but I think this is kind of cool ah so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
but I think this is kind of cool ah so
you<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.990> some<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> cool<00:01:55.740> clone<00:01:56.430> map

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you have some kind of cool clone map

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
you have some kind of cool clone map
feature<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.509> let's<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.049> friend<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
feature so let's see how a friend and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
feature so let's see how a friend and
you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.610> want<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.030> map<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you know you also want that map then you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870 
you know you also want that map then you
possibly<00:02:01.469> could<00:02:01.740> borrow<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
possibly could borrow you don't have to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
possibly could borrow you don't have to
borrow<00:02:03.119> your<00:02:03.450> own<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.020> could<00:02:04.290> basically

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
borrow your own you could basically

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520 
borrow your own you could basically
clone<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.899> where

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
clone it and you will like see where

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
clone it and you will like see where
that<00:02:07.740> other<00:02:07.920> person<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> map<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.539> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that other person are on the map so I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.410 
that other person are on the map so I
think<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.619> kind<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.979> huge<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.300> going

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
think this kind of huge and it's going

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.370 
think this kind of huge and it's going
to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.569> kind<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.810> cool<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.050> see

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to be kind of cool to see

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.130 
to be kind of cool to see
how<00:02:13.950> they're<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.240> because<00:02:15.810> I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
how they're going to do this because I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
how they're going to do this because I
mean<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.130> weird<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.750> cool

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
mean it kind of weird like but it's cool

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.930 
mean it kind of weird like but it's cool
this<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.670> next<00:02:20.820> step

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this is this is you know the next step

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.750 
this is this is you know the next step
and<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:22.170> bike<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.380> still<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.100> beta<00:02:23.400> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and the bike up still is in beta it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140 
and the bike up still is in beta it's
amazing<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.870> seems<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.110> right<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.970> have

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
amazing it seems like right now you have

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150 
amazing it seems like right now you have
like<00:02:27.330> different<00:02:27.810> modes<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.410> hold<00:02:28.890> your

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
like different modes you can hold your

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.280 
like different modes you can hold your
little<00:02:29.370> map<00:02:29.610> there<00:02:29.940> also<00:02:30.690> seems<00:02:30.900> like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
little map there also seems like

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
little map there also seems like
currently<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.340> kind<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.580> sad<00:02:32.760> doesn't

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
currently this is kind of sad doesn't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.540 
currently this is kind of sad doesn't
seem<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:34.440> mapping<00:02:34.740> piece<00:02:35.070> should<00:02:35.310> work

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
seem that this mapping piece should work

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.600 
seem that this mapping piece should work
in<00:02:35.880> multiplayer<00:02:36.300> mode<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.400> hopefully<00:02:38.400> they

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
in multiplayer mode but hopefully they

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.420 
in multiplayer mode but hopefully they
will<00:02:38.910> launch<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.660> Micra<00:02:39.960> 1.6<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
will launch that in the Micra 1.6 you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
will launch that in the Micra 1.6 you
know<00:02:41.580> release<00:02:41.880> because<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.300> mean<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.540> kind<00:02:42.690> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
know release because I mean it's kind of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.080 
know release because I mean it's kind of
boring<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.400> employing<00:02:44.400> seeing<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.850> player

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
boring to be employing seeing a player

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.000 
boring to be employing seeing a player
and<00:02:45.330> how<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> map<00:02:45.780> feature<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:46.800> it's

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and how the map feature but it's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.610 
and how the map feature but it's
definitely<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.730> comer<00:02:48.510> Play<00:02:48.780> feature<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.320> mean

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
definitely a comer Play feature I mean

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.950 
definitely a comer Play feature I mean
if<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.160> being<00:02:50.670> made<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.210> multiply<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.810> you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
if it's being made for multiply that you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.870 
if it's being made for multiply that you
can<00:02:52.080> see<00:02:52.320> where<00:02:52.890> all<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.220> other<00:02:53.370> friends<00:02:53.730> are

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
can see where all the other friends are

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.150 
can see where all the other friends are
on<00:02:54.060> map<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.780> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.020> be<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.230> awesome<00:02:55.500> it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
on map that's going to be all awesome it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
on map that's going to be all awesome it
seems<00:02:56.370> like<00:02:56.550> now<00:02:56.730> they<00:02:56.940> held<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.240> limit<00:02:57.660> on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
seems like now they held like a limit on

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.690 
seems like now they held like a limit on
how<00:02:57.900> many<00:02:58.320> unique<00:02:58.770> maps<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.190> help<00:02:59.490> her

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
how many unique maps you can help her

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.020 
how many unique maps you can help her
world<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.270> needs<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.570> be<00:03:00.890> 65,000<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.100> he<00:03:02.940> is

mean<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.990> don't<00:03:19.230> even<00:03:19.350> think<00:03:19.470> people<00:03:20.190> given<00:03:20.760> to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
mean I don't even think people given to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.990 
mean I don't even think people given to
have<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.300> maps<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.430> 65,000<00:03:23.430> unique<00:03:23.730> maps

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
have that in maps but 65,000 unique maps

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.410 
have that in maps but 65,000 unique maps
must<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.900> something<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.940> mistake

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
must be something that you in a mistake

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.330 
must be something that you in a mistake
near<00:03:27.780> something<00:03:28.050> like<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.320> because<00:03:28.440> 65,000

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
near something like that because 65,000

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.510 
near something like that because 65,000
laps<00:03:29.580> for<00:03:29.820> world<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.630> sounds<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.170> lot<00:03:31.320> but<00:03:32.040> yeah

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
laps for world it sounds a lot but yeah

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.610 
laps for world it sounds a lot but yeah
this<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:33.120> kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.840> only<00:03:34.050> feature<00:03:34.200> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
this is kind of like the only feature I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.410 
this is kind of like the only feature I
think<00:03:34.920> we're<00:03:35.190> going<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.460> see<00:03:35.520> here<00:03:36.180> and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
think we're going to see here and

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.810 
think we're going to see here and
because<00:03:36.690> I'm<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:36.960> a<00:03:36.990> bit<00:03:37.350> mentioned<00:03:37.830> any<00:03:38.040> more

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
because I'm in a bit mentioned any more

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.040 
because I'm in a bit mentioned any more
in<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.300> microphone<00:03:39.960> point<00:03:40.170> six<00:03:40.410> but<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.640> is

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
in the microphone point six but it is

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.140 
in the microphone point six but it is
going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.380> release<00:03:44.100> microphone<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:44.850> 6<00:03:45.060> i'm

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
going to be release microphone for 6 i'm

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.290 
going to be release microphone for 6 i'm
not<00:03:45.270> quite<00:03:45.480> sure<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.040> he<00:03:47.040> made<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.340> other

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
estate not soon hmm main feature maps by

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.140 
estate not soon hmm main feature maps by
fixes<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:57.170> also<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.709> letter<00:03:59.310> e<00:03:59.730> mullins

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
fixes and also that the letter e mullins

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.930 
fixes and also that the letter e mullins
working<00:04:00.780> right<00:04:00.900> now<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.610> yeah<00:04:02.610> hopefully

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
working right now so yeah hopefully

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.140 
working right now so yeah hopefully
we'll<00:04:03.360> see<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:04.080> come<00:04:04.500> out<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:05.010> before<00:04:05.550> me<00:04:05.880> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
we'll see it come out here before me and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.180 
we'll see it come out here before me and
but<00:04:06.570> i<00:04:06.840> think<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.170> caviar<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.620> release

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
but i think this caviar you release

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.490 
but i think this caviar you release
because<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.090> mean<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.540> mapping<00:04:09.840> feature<00:04:09.990> is

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
because I mean the mapping feature is

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.199 
because I mean the mapping feature is
probably<00:04:10.800> something<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.250> could<00:04:11.430> tape<00:04:11.790> or

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
probably something that I could tape or

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.330 
probably something that I could tape or
I<00:04:12.690> think<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.110> takes<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.500> lot<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.709> time<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.010> CODIS

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
I think it takes a lot of time to CODIS

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.820 
I think it takes a lot of time to CODIS
over<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.030> yeah<00:04:16.020> hopefully<00:04:16.260> he<00:04:16.590> will<00:04:16.680> make

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
over that so yeah hopefully he will make

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.220 
over that so yeah hopefully he will make
it<00:04:16.859> really<00:04:17.370> good<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.730> we'll<00:04:17.940> see<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.540> early

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
it really good and we'll see a early

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.500 
it really good and we'll see a early
june<00:04:19.530> release<00:04:19.709> on<00:04:20.190> microphone<00:04:20.640> 16<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.299> then<00:04:21.390> i

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
june release on microphone 16 and then i

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.930 
june release on microphone 16 and then i
also<00:04:21.540> can<00:04:21.870> make<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.740> video<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.370> know

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
also can make a of the video you know

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850 
also can make a of the video you know
maybe<00:04:24.270> shooting<00:04:24.900> off<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.229> new<00:04:25.440> cool

feature make on my server with this new
release<00:04:28.919> but<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.030> sweet<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:31.319> you<00:04:31.560> scrape<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
release but it's sweet so you scrape the
