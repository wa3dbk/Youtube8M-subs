 good trade in vienna is already a readings 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.660
 a little Christmas spirit, what happens 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.280
 because here are just series background 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.410
 we see how our santa clauses 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.070
 but I am there 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.620
 together 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.359
 We make the santa men for all 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.320
 We believe in Santa Claus 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.760
 but also have a Christmas 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.180
 more similar we have no christkind 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.890
 what you produce for us 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.350
 how many santa clauses are here 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.790
 made yes we do a lot 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.140
 santa clauses not only for the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.210
 Austrian market we drive with 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.500
 the santa claus still in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 special shops in Germany until the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.200
 kadewe breakdown with this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.550
 santa clauses and i think so 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.640
 piece of tooth is hard to say though 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.809
 it would be about the $ 78 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.879
 and santa clauses 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.260
 how long will it take to get one 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.879
 Maybe they can finish this way 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.680
 the different steps explain the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.140
 He passes through a santa claus 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.820
 That's what I like to do when she does 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.739
 I follow the access we go to one 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.750
 form and then we look at it like 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.970
 that is done in practice so 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.190
 first of all start so we have 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.820
 For this foundation form how to do it 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.440
 here looks like this 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.720
 and now we have one, of course 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.520
 face and that looks right out 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 we have the syringe 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.870
 the eyebrows and in the bathroom a bit 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.870
 to draftsman 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.020
 And now it's time for the milk chocolate 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 down 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 Motto with the form 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.990
 remember his chocolate and now 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.270
 Let's give it a counterpart that we 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.810
 two halves always have one with you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.810
 find magnets together and those 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.900
 chocolate ring in there now and out 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.410
 Go chocolate in the bourne 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.369
 now on a sling and the finished one 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.960
 nikolos here again 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.960
 and we can open it 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 Let's see if the chocolate show 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.500
 This time we heard them from the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500
 cooling 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.750
 st 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.760
 and now you can see that very nice 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 together the nikolo beautiful with the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.050
 eyebrows with mustache fix done 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.690
 and that one too now 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.100
 environmentally friendly packaging comes only in 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 a slide into it 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.750
 it goes on like this 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.790
 and then we have ours here 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.440
 Santa Claus will be standing then 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.700
 you can pack it beautifully 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.110
 big bags and then the classic 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.290
 Santa Claus likes to sell us 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.900
 then are these santa clauses 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.490
 klarsicht very beautiful to the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.010
 she likes that my good language 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.440
 we use for our use 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.140
 Nicholas and Santa Claus only one 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.640
 original years milk chocolate like 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.930
 Looks that out with the form he sees 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.240
 Santa Claus actually every year 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.980
 right out 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.020
 The classic Santa Claus is always 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.450
 the same is somehow that way 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.850
 tradition and we want those old ones 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.130
 Traditions with us always maintained 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.300
 now there is a bad rumor that 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.610
 the santa claus from the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.010
 melted easter bunnies are true 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.570
 yes those rumors have always been 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.640
 been made 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.710
 but of course that's not true because we are 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.170
 make everything fresh again and if 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.140
 then something should stay over then 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.810
 The goods are mostly charitable 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.310
 give away purposes now you think so before 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.900
 Christmas will be in the summer 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.370
 but now it is already with the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.280
 So it's not really October anymore 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.570
 Lots of time how many days a year will be 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.190
 then the Christmas goods actually 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.750
 produced here 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.020
 we go every time with the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.300
 Christmas goods at the end of september but the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.390
 big companies all in october in 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.100
 your shelves want to have for ours 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.110
 branches are mostly from the 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.450
 All Saints are produced and we drive 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.960
 often with Christmas goods until the last 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.770
 minute 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.510
 sometimes even on 22 december 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.520
 be honest like many of you 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.940
 They will become these santa clauses 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.170
 eat this year 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.239
 I honestly can not 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.280
 I estimate would cost and then already 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.260
 so much so that means in the past 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.210
 I try the chocolates good 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 Knack had or says good 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.170
 taste I have always known 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.030
 breaks away from the boiler but I can 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.830
 do not express how much christmas 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.350
 if I really think so 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.160
 Over the ten men are in the course of 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.160
 months
