00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.870
 what we use most in a smartphone 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.970
 are undoubtedly your applications today 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.700
 we have applications for all and 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.840
 downloaded from different sources either 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.140
 from google play 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.480
 amazon or directly from some web like 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.730
 with important photos or files 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.920
 it may happen that our phone is 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.019
 break it we lose it or we have to 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.580
 restore so it's good to make a 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.160
 backup of applications 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.280
 that we have purchased downloaded by itself 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.050
 perhaps and how we do it in this case 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.520
 let's work with an application 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.340
 easy call 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.780
 backup a more than obvious name for your 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 functionality 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.710
 this application collects in a list 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
 all the applications that we have 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.480
 installed on our android phone 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.000
 as a destination for the backup or copy of 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.370
 security allows us to choose the card 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.590
 sd of the mobile or our google account 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.300
 drive thinking about those that 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.530
 find with external storage 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.630
 make a backup of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.510
 applications on android is so easy 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.580
 how to choose the destination and click on 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.770
 application that we want to support 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.230
 the menu that appears gives us several 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.470
 options so in this case we press 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.810
 about backup this will make the apk of the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.010
 application is stored in the destination 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.900
 chosen one 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.600
 in case you need to restore e 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.000
 install the applications on this or another 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.910
 mobile we will need the same application 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.370
 that we have used we will go to the panel 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.340
 options and we will press on biofach to 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.620
 this list us to the applications that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 we have saved to reinstall 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.500
 we click on each one and choose 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.990
 install from sd or install google drive 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.940
 depending on the destination of the copies so 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.940
 simple as that you think
