what<00:00:00.480> you're<00:00:00.630> looking<00:00:00.690> at<00:00:00.900> here<00:00:00.960> are

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
what you're looking at here are

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.730 
what you're looking at here are
magnesium<00:00:02.460> Flint<00:00:02.939> fire<00:00:03.210> starters<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.899> these

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
magnesium Flint fire starters and these

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.980 
magnesium Flint fire starters and these
are<00:00:04.859> pretty<00:00:04.980> good<00:00:05.600> because<00:00:06.600> they're

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
are pretty good because they're

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.259 
are pretty good because they're
completely<00:00:07.529> waterproof<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.880> most<00:00:09.030> part

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
completely waterproof for the most part

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.930 
completely waterproof for the most part
they're<00:00:09.420> windproof<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.610> they're<00:00:11.610> pretty

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
they're windproof and they're pretty

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.049 
they're windproof and they're pretty
much<00:00:12.059> indestructible<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.840> well<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.639> guess

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
much indestructible as well so I guess

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.039 
much indestructible as well so I guess
there's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> couple<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:15.509> types<00:00:15.719> here

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
there's a couple different types here

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.140 
there's a couple different types here
this<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:17.730> looks<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this one here this actually looks like a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.300 
this one here this actually looks like a
rod<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.510> flint<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.470> there's<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
rod of flint but there's actually a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.099 
rod of flint but there's actually a
bunch<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.970> magnesium<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> bottom<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
bunch of magnesium on the bottom and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
bunch of magnesium on the bottom and
then<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.500> little<00:00:22.769> rod<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> Flint<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> top<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
then a little rod of Flint on the top so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
then a little rod of Flint on the top so
it's<00:00:25.350> pretty<00:00:25.650> portable<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.340> stick<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.609> on

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's pretty portable you can stick it on

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
it's pretty portable you can stick it on
your<00:00:26.820> keychain<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
your keychain and this one here is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.679 
your keychain and this one here is
around<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> same<00:00:29.550> size<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.330> one's<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> little

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
around the same size this one's a little

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.970 
around the same size this one's a little
bit<00:00:30.840> better<00:00:31.050> though<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.679> comes<00:00:31.830> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
bit better though because it comes with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
bit better though because it comes with
probably<00:00:32.899> four<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:33.930> five<00:00:34.050> times<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> amount

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
probably four or five times the amount

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.100 
probably four or five times the amount
of<00:00:34.739> Flint<00:00:34.980> or<00:00:35.130> sorry<00:00:35.880> Flint<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.300> magnesium<00:00:36.840> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of Flint or sorry Flint and magnesium so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
of Flint or sorry Flint and magnesium so
it'll<00:00:37.860> last<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:38.550> hundred<00:00:38.730> fires

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it'll last you for a good hundred fires

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
it'll last you for a good hundred fires
as<00:00:39.450> opposed<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.739> people<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
as opposed to this one that people to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
as opposed to this one that people to
get<00:00:41.190> 20<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.520> 30<00:00:41.820> fires<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.719> it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
get 20 or 30 fires out of it so it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.330 
get 20 or 30 fires out of it so it's
still<00:00:43.350> pretty<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.280> last

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
still pretty good but this one will last

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.450 
still pretty good but this one will last
you<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.610> lot<00:00:44.700> longer<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.530> actually<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
you a lot longer and actually about this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.830 
you a lot longer and actually about this
one's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:48.000> heavier<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
one's a little bit heavier but that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
one's a little bit heavier but that
doesn't<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.170> matter<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> course

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
doesn't really matter and then of course

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
doesn't really matter and then of course
it<00:00:51.390> comes<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.719> striker<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.379> got

a little pile of magnesium magnesium but

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.429 
a little pile of magnesium magnesium but
probably<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> size<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> marble<00:01:26.930> that

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:52.310 

doesn't<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.560> too<00:01:31.710> long

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.840 

there<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.409> go<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:55.210> gather<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.110> together

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
there we go and just gather it together

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590 
there we go and just gather it together
into<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.970> little<00:01:58.060> pile<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:59.140> dump<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.220> out<00:02:00.600> onto

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
into a little pile and dump it out onto

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.210 
into a little pile and dump it out onto
the<00:02:01.950> block<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.130> cement<00:02:07.769> that's<00:02:08.769> pretty<00:02:09.039> good

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the block of cement that's pretty good

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.580 
the block of cement that's pretty good
and<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:10.509> shoot<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.929> few<00:02:11.080> sparks<00:02:11.410> at

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
and then you just shoot a few sparks at

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.520 
and then you just shoot a few sparks at
it<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:13.330> once<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.720> starts<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.050> burn<00:02:14.319> you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
it and then once it starts to burn you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.590 
it and then once it starts to burn you
just<00:02:14.709> throw<00:02:15.160> your<00:02:15.220> tinder<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.640> top<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.120> it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
just throw your tinder on top and it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.880
