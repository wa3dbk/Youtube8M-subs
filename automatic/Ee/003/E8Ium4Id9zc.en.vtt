00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
these out for any camera I get the same

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.810 
these out for any camera I get the same
results<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.940> TTY<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.480> t3i<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.500> t4<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> save<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
results like a TTY or t3i or t4 I save a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
results like a TTY or t3i or t4 I save a
little<00:00:45.030> money<00:00:45.210> maybe<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> zoom<00:00:46.260> lens<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
little money maybe have a zoom lens and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
little money maybe have a zoom lens and
this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> primary<00:00:47.460> angle<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.300> 17<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> 50

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this is the primary angle it's 17 to 50

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.410 
this is the primary angle it's 17 to 50
and<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.890> running<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.670> 40

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and we are running it at about 40

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.869 
and we are running it at about 40
millimeters<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.860> our<00:00:52.980> wider<00:00:53.219> shot<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
millimeters to get our wider shot and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.689 
millimeters to get our wider shot and
then<00:00:53.969> we've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> 50<00:00:54.660> millimeter<00:00:54.840> lens<00:00:55.699> here

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
then we've got a 50 millimeter lens here

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
then we've got a 50 millimeter lens here
on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> 74<00:00:57.629> our<00:00:57.719> second<00:00:58.050> angle<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
on the 74 our second angle so we have a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
on the 74 our second angle so we have a
wide<00:00:58.800> shot<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> tight<00:00:59.730> shot<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.840> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
wide shot and a tight shot then we do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
wide shot and a tight shot then we do
all<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> our<00:01:01.379> audio<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:02.039> wireless

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
all of our audio with wireless

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.090

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and then we've got the zoom h4n that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
and then we've got the zoom h4n that
goes<00:01:08.490> directly<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.510> did<00:01:09.689> another<00:01:09.930> post
