00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.880
 grass message 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.150
 now we will use the last 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.270
 minecraft snapshots 18 and here we are 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.050
 we will use this indicator 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.260
 when we mess and dirt let's give 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.500
 yourself dirt and give ourselves a normal dirt 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.019
 let's go on opposite sides so i have 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.859
 due to normal and other dirt 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.940
 press f3 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:56.269
 suggest our dirt and as we go here 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.129
 here we have written option default but 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.929
 when we look at this drill with which 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.329
 we sit 0 through the command here we see 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.600
 what we have is a graph option which means 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.930
 degrees is that this earth does not grow 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.380
 grass 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.110
 that's how we see the indicator we have this 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 land kraz laz around this she doesn't 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.700
 overgrown and we will use 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.180
 teams we have game roll maternity hospital kick sleeps 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 she became available last snapshot 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.820
 usually text us food that is three 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.930
 there is if we let put hail here 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.080
 block then it will spread very 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.180
 very long but if we change this 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 indicator for something more permissible by 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.760
 750 include how we see it all 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.620
 starts to grow very very fast but 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.890
 after all, this is random therefore on my 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.440
 mentality should not count as 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.330
 it still belongs to the trees can 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.300
 anyone come up with something ancient 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.450
 let's set turn on look look 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.250
 We look about and the tree has grown too 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.840
 pretty fast almost 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.930
 can instantly grow but you can 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.550
 wait 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.640
 we will do it naturally i think 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.150
 everyone understood first we build all our 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.920
 the message we want 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.640
 the dirt of which we do not grow up to that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.680
 fill in all this ordinary mud turn on 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 our team 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.959
 naturally that will accelerate our 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:35.980
 Kiki put here gryzlov and turn on 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.840
 our team and all the way we see it 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.019
 Yes, they start to grow overnight 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.760
 but still we can increase the rate 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.010
 also yet 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.629
 if this will be used for one 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.579
 strike that most likely we have 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:56.319
 that is, we can use this city 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:00.659
 block as a key to the player and put 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.659
 This city ​​where it is not necessary let's 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:10.750
 go to Helmut 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 Helmut 2 is our adventure mod we give 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.540
 currently we see 2 different lands now 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.010
 can't break nothing not build 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.540
 because we are well, that's my evening, but we 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.629
 gave yourself this grass and and we can 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.519
 only put on lapis lazuli block 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.769
 second grass we can stand on 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.909
 obsidian block on no others we 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.840
 you can under 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.639
 so let's go back to the usual creative and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.090
 let's see what kind of team 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:46.479
 that is, in fact we give permission 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.979
 so that this block can be put only to us 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:53.530
 sitting not but the team will be in the description 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:58.299
 sit down but these too i will tell you too 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.090
 such an idea to return if you this 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.419
 it will be necessary your lyrics yes that is 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.030
 we can dig but make ready 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:11.229
 version of our label that we already have 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.530
 eat and make a test for the block here this 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.250
 areas so when we have it all 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.789
 overgrown 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.969
 since we need the test for team y 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.010
 gives us a signal and let's say a block command 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:27.620
 will change our cupcake spots 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.520
 trovich where on the standard and it at us 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.940
 something will return if you need so well 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.100
