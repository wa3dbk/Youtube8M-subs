00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.260
 Tell me guys, whats going on with this club? 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.480
 And today it is said in the version 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.470
 of thássius 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.240
 mother's shell 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.880
 this song is a composition by patrick 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.830
 banks and all the cipher clusters are 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 That's when I'll play the song and then 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.220
 It's going to be very simple for you. 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.220
 Chords only a rhythm 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 I heard 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:57.500
 And you like Mom's lap. 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 and to play the whole song we go 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.210
 use only four chords these here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.210
 the first is the largest mole 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 after him there with 5th and 9th 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 which can also be done with the fingers 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.260
 14 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:34.310
 after him the small and small 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 last cycle is the fifth and ninth 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.479
 that's it, I'll show you how to play 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.909
 for you 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.979
 the standard rhythm of this song is well 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.979
 known to the galley is the one here 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.510
 now a little slower 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.520
 two down 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.130
 two up and one down and now 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.670
 alternating down down up down 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.670
 up 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.880
 We're going to make it bigger for me. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.880
 the home with 5th and 9th twice 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.570
 now the next chord will start the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 end of the song is the C sharp 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.670
 And we 're gonna make the rhythm like that. 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.409
 once again 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.860
 down downtown again and now 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.860
 alternating 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.299
 the same thing we'll do for the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.299
 next package is the cycle 5º and 9º 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.100
 and now there's a difference in the pace 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.100
 it will stay like this 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.799
 once again 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.890
 We'll play once down. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.890
 riding a chord from there with quintino 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.200
 Now we're going to hit our right hand. 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.300
 on the ropes play down and hit 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.700
 making this percussive sound here and 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.060
 back with a gift for a touch to 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 top 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.010
 we change by itself who has 9 touched 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.010
 down 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.010
 and ends the music with standard rhythm 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.110
 biggest name 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.330
 you can repeat the song the number of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.640
 times you want 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.560
 yes, wonder this was the version 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360
