00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.249
 very good people I'm already here with the 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.990
 console and the game the game we're going to 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.150
 see in a moment later you already know that 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.400
 I'm not open normal editions but 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.440
 how does everything come together 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.920
 how I wanted to mount my own pack 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.100
 I'll open it quickly we have to put 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.290
 nothing that the cell console the the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.070
 version in between world already you know 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.260
 that previously there was another console 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.259
 is exactly what is he or verÃ­n 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.010
 of time that the first 3ds that came out of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.300
 cell 2 with decent designs better said 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.430
 and good is the box is also very 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.680
 pretty as you are watching over here 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.680
 behind we have letters and up here 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.470
 we have the cell logo 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.710
 and we will proceed to open the equipment 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.590
 through the images and another console 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.900
 that neither has the charger is a 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.480
 sorry but good people like me that the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.940
 it has already other consoles do not 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.219
 upset 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 but for those who do not have it, it is 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.000
 a little tonal ana says pay ten euros 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.590
 for a charger 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.780
 let's open it 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.230
 the open before to get the code 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.080
 over here to get the code 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.240
 digital because as you know my interest is not 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.399
 will do a promotion 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.039
 registering a console for example this 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.220
 and a game of 15 that in the listing 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.340
 that they have they will enter the option 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.579
 of having I do not know what you're going to have the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.280
 option to catch the one mario an agreement 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.759
 what exactly was the name we are going to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.759
 see what we were going 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.600
 more things out and good here we are going to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 see how the console is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.850
 will follow the form 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 and here you have it, look pretty, it's there 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.799
 we have the logo on one side and 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.240
 here we have the other logo I do not know if 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.960
 what are you going to see there is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.130
 inside 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:12.180
 It is also golden with the buttons on 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.400
 black - helium gray sticker is pretty 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.970
 well and the slack the typical one that has 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 the consoles of 3ds that alarmed us and if 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.870
 those move a bit that is normal 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.940
 and basically the console is the design in 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.940
 the two sides of the trifuerza 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.770
 good and compared to the one I have 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.350
 over here I'm going to be taught before 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.990
 as you see 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.790
 one the small tall the big the two 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.739
 They are a pretty nice design 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.069
 the difference is that this one had this 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.040
 golden entrance and this is black as the 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.170
 back but good leave us 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.940
 there and the console here 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.580
 let's open the game that you remember that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.470
 has reversible cover 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.620
 this is the golden side I do not know why 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.360
 This has not been against the cover 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.570
 from behind to get us to bring the 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.570
 Logo 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.770
 after plastic plastics days 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.770
 deposits 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.140
 let's open it 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.849
 this would be the code that would have to 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.770
 register from November 27 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:26.160
 to access the game of nintendo 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.580
 crap manuals here we see the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.950
 game 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.110
 and on this side as we said the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.300
 back cover that is a cover 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.800
 reversible, it would have been 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.360
 better this side that would have been the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.860
 golden over here not having the logo 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.750
 happy 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.750
 but good is not bad 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.709
 and this has been what has been the 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.209
 unboxing of the console that is 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.549
 basically what we were going to 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.560
 mattered in this video me since I 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.989
 I caught on while teaching the face 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.549
 reversible game I hope that you 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.560
 I liked it and I see you in a little while 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.569
 I'm going to make a small gameplay of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.079
 the first minutes of the game until the 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.079
 sight people
