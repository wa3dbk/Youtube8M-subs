00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.080
 the cars that are driven by themselves 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.910
 they seem to be the future of transportation 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.430
 but we are really ready for this 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.299
 future hello I am aldo and this is the robot 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.299
 of platÃ³n inventions 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.110
 and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.130
 Y 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.540
 most of us are aware 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 Huggel faces these cars that have a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.440
 little thing turning up which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.060
 allows you to manage yourself there are photos 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.060
 iphoto tell me what photo 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 but perhaps these others are really 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 ready for us because it seems that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 google needs to fix certain things 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 so that they can be commercialized since 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 the last six years the google cards 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.460
 have been involved in little more than 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 a dozen minor shocks and also 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.089
 recently in the first accident 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.649
 serious of an all-controlled car that has 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.659
 left three of his workers 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.159
 injured then you would have to 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.559
 solve according to live blog 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.750
 science are five things that you have to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 definitely improve first better 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.990
 software and a smartphone or computer 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.369
 any other device has the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 necessary software so that they can 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.159
 handle safely for a long 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 period of time without that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.110
 device that freezes will be destroyed or 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.850
 the signal goes 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.930
 these errors would be fatal if you go to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.790
 100 kilometers per hour the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 signal the odds that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 survive is clear they are minimal in this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.910
 there is no software that is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.470
 improving your security problems 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.030
 second best maps the google cars 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.570
 It handles very well through the streets of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.800
 mountain view in california usa this is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.840
 because google has created a virtual map 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.520
 of the city specifically the car 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 he knows how the streets look when they're 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.650
 empty all they do is fill them 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.060
 with obstacles like cars and pedestrians 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.860
 to make this global scale is still missing 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.200
 a lot since google has only mapped 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 about three thousand 220 kilometers of the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.730
 more than 6 million kilometers that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.370
 has the USA on roads 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.170
 about us if you want to know how much is a 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.680
 million exactly you can see my video 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.720
 how many lands fit in the sun 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.650
 third best sensors these cars 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.140
 they have to be able to identify 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.330
 that is harmless and that this from another 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.330
 way they would be constantly braking 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.780
 fourth best communication once 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.610
 these cars begin to be distributed by 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.069
 the world will need the best way 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 to communicate with other cars in accordance 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.069
 have different types of situations 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.690
 these cars will need flexibility 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.819
 to adjust to the other cars of the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.890
 roads and shelter and communicate with 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.660
 other cars of the same type since without 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.500
 that ability would make the suit with a lot 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 worse than it is today 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.360
 and in these moments the communication 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 between these cars is minimal 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.410
 and finally fifth we have to have 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 ethical robots sometimes us when 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.350
 we manage we find ourselves in situations 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.290
 difficult in which we have to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.240
 decide here we have to kill if 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.610
 we have on one side a truck with three 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.990
 passengers and in the other a motorcyclist and 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.420
 anyway we're going to kill one of 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.650
 they whom we decided to kill for more 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.450
 hard it sounds sometimes we come across 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.010
 these decisions in our lives and if 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.900
 a robot could do this would be something 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.530
 unprecedented in the history of the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.810
 humanity an ethical robot imagines that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.520
 this according to the portal this scenario still 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.740
 they are far from us for many 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330
 decades but do not get discouraged with the 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.190
 technology you never know are for example 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.530
 look how they moved us in space 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.140
 after we got the moon to its 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.470
 managing that power this video and it will be 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.470
 next 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.930
 in English it means sandalwood if the one 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 takes care of the pod but progress 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.470
 speeches bodies also 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.210
 They are in charge of, for example, producing heat 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.030
 record of how it came to be named 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.490
 tangan to a bar because that's a name 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.140
 unmanned aerial vehicle technician is 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.420
 traces back to the Second World War 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.870
 shortly before this the British were 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.870
 the first
