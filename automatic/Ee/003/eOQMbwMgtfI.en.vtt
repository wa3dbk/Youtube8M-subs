00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
think a lot of people deal with this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.970 
think a lot of people deal with this
there's<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.720> these<00:00:30.890> kind<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> weird<00:00:33.980> windows

there's all these kind of weird windows
that<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.839> know<00:00:36.839> does<00:00:37.140> normal<00:00:37.470> curtains<00:00:38.010> don't

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that you know does normal curtains don't

that you know does normal curtains don't
apply<00:00:38.699> to<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.710> came<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:40.949> with<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
apply to and so we came up with this and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.009 
apply to and so we came up with this and
I<00:00:41.790> thought<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.089> was<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.449> cool<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
I thought it was really cool so I

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.770 
I thought it was really cool so I
thought<00:00:43.260> it'd<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> quick<00:00:43.860> video<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
thought it'd make a quick video so this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.130 
thought it'd make a quick video so this
