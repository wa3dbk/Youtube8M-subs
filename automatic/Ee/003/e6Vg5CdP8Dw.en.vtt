grew this year and I've already
collected<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.969> seeds<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> spring<00:02:03.930> peas

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
collected the seeds so the spring peas

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
collected the seeds so the spring peas
produced<00:02:06.119> well<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.540> save<00:02:06.869> some<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.229> pods

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.020 
produced well I save some of the pods
save<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> seeds<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.429> don't<00:02:08.610> even<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
in light it's a lot nicer to thin out

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.260 
in light it's a lot nicer to thin out
plants<00:02:34.720> than<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.800> not<00:02:36.130> have<00:02:36.310> any<00:02:36.460> plants<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
plants than to not have any plants you

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.860 
plants than to not have any plants you
know<00:02:37.390> come<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:37.630> at<00:02:37.870> all<00:02:39.390> put<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.690> there

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
know come up at all put that in there
and<00:02:41.380> then<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.010> rest<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.430> good<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.850> be

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
and then the rest it's good to just be

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.280 
and then the rest it's good to just be
in<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.240> front<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:44.860> red<00:02:45.040> lettuces<00:02:46.110> these<00:02:47.110> were

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
in the front my red lettuces these were

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.850 
in the front my red lettuces these were
started<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.490> said<00:02:48.760> about<00:02:49.540> two<00:02:49.810> weeks<00:02:50.020> ago

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.360 

so<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> will<00:02:54.220> get<00:02:54.370> basil<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.470> peas<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.130> fall

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so I will get basil and peas in the fall

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.600 
so I will get basil and peas in the fall
and<00:02:57.640> lettuce<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.010> the<00:03:00.010> lettuce<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.460> going

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610

to go here because my son is behind me
this<00:03:03.280> way<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> lettuce<00:03:04.390> will<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.810> Sun

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
this way so the lettuce will get the Sun

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.900 
this way so the lettuce will get the Sun
the<00:03:05.290> peas<00:03:05.500> will<00:03:05.710> leave<00:03:05.890> behind<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.730> just

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the peas will leave behind it you just

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.010 
the peas will leave behind it you just
want<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.060> make<00:03:07.180> sure<00:03:07.210> when<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.600> plant<00:03:07.900> you

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
want to make sure when you plant you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.240 
want to make sure when you plant you
don't<00:03:08.050> do<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.440> reverse<00:03:08.740> if<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.980> put<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
don't do the reverse if I put the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
don't do the reverse if I put the
lettuce<00:03:09.430> back<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.420> peas<00:03:10.660> grow<00:03:10.930> here

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
lettuce back there the peas grow here

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.070 
lettuce back there the peas grow here
the<00:03:11.620> lettuce<00:03:11.890> would<00:03:12.010> be<00:03:12.160> shaded<00:03:12.430> out<00:03:12.900> I'm<00:03:13.900> also

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
the lettuce would be shaded out I'm also

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.890 
the lettuce would be shaded out I'm also
going<00:03:14.320> to<00:03:14.380> grow<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.740> is<00:03:15.570> sort<00:03:16.570> of<00:03:16.690> cut<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
going to grow this is sort of cut and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.870 
going to grow this is sort of cut and
come<00:03:17.200> again<00:03:17.230> lettuce<00:03:17.800> which<00:03:18.190> means<00:03:18.460> I'm<00:03:18.640> not

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
come again lettuce which means I'm not

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.160 
come again lettuce which means I'm not
going<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> pull<00:03:19.360> out<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.750> whole<00:03:19.930> root<00:03:20.140> system

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
going to pull out the whole root system

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.090 
going to pull out the whole root system
so<00:03:21.100> it's<00:03:21.280> okay<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:23.670> pack<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.700> in<00:03:25.950> split<00:03:26.950> this

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
so it's okay if I pack it in split this

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.670 
so it's okay if I pack it in split this
down<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.460> middle<00:03:27.490> there's<00:03:27.850> about<00:03:28.380> six<00:03:29.380> plants

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
down the middle there's about six plants

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.680 
down the middle there's about six plants
in<00:03:29.890> there<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.520> just<00:03:31.060> tear<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.620> tuck<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:33.010> in

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.930 

just<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:37.010> same<00:03:37.340> thing<00:03:37.520> with<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.760> I'm

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
just like that same thing with this I'm

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.360 
just like that same thing with this I'm
going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.120> break<00:03:38.360> one<00:03:38.390> off<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.170> don't<00:03:40.010> mind<00:03:40.220> if

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.400 
going to break one off I don't mind if
there's<00:03:40.550> two<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.090> three<00:03:42.460> plants<00:03:44.110> or<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.170> little

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
there's two or three plants or a little

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.530 
there's two or three plants or a little
planting<00:03:45.860> there<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.940> one<00:03:47.060> only<00:03:47.240> has<00:03:47.450> one

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.360 

and<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.409> see<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.709> don't<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.129> to<00:03:53.159> be

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and you can see you don't have to be

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.610 
and you can see you don't have to be
gentle<00:03:54.799> just<00:03:55.799> get<00:03:55.980> him<00:03:56.099> in<00:03:56.189> there

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.430 

and<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.400> going<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.670> produce<00:04:02.080> lots<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.260> red

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and this is going to produce lots of red
