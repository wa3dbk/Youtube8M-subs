where<00:00:06.750> all<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.680> work<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.099> being<00:00:08.309> done<00:00:08.849> by

where all the work is being done by
robotic<00:00:09.540> devices<00:00:10.110> but<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.530> case<00:00:10.800> we

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
robotic devices but in that case we

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.919 
robotic devices but in that case we
should<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.120> such<00:00:12.360> an<00:00:12.450> advanced<00:00:12.780> society

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929

is NASA we have placed some important
equipment<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.699> the<00:00:35.760> Rovers<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.180> are

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:36.269 
equipment on two of the Rovers that are

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.180 
equipment on two of the Rovers that are
still<00:00:36.449> operating<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.960> Mars<00:00:37.230> Burnie<00:00:37.980> we're

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
still operating on Mars Burnie we're

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.590 
still operating on Mars Burnie we're
gonna<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.579> off<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.699> a<00:00:38.879> vodka<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.449> tonic

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
gonna start off with a vodka and tonic

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.899 
gonna start off with a vodka and tonic
place<00:00:40.019> it<00:00:40.500> would<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.100> pleasure

place it would be my pleasure
here<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.239> honeybee<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.720> invented<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.199> first

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
here at honeybee we invented the first

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.170 
here at honeybee we invented the first
robotic<00:00:44.129> bartender<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:46.519> we<00:00:47.519> are<00:00:47.640> hoping<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
robotic bartender and we are hoping to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600 
robotic bartender and we are hoping to
develop<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> robotic<00:00:49.500> surgical<00:00:49.979> tool<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
develop a robotic surgical tool the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.030 
develop a robotic surgical tool the
robot<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.329> enter<00:00:51.870> through<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.350> cavity<00:00:52.860> that's

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
robot can enter through a cavity that's

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.340 
robot can enter through a cavity that's
very<00:00:53.309> tiny<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.330> person<00:00:54.720> has<00:00:54.869> a<00:00:54.900> short

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
very tiny so the person has a short

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.079 
very tiny so the person has a short
recovery<00:00:55.739> time<00:00:55.979> but<00:00:56.189> it's<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
recovery time but it's not just that the

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.570 
recovery time but it's not just that the
robot<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.019> make<00:00:58.439> very<00:00:58.860> very<00:00:58.979> tiny

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
robot can also make very very tiny

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.030 
robot can also make very very tiny
movements<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.629> notion<00:01:01.049> is<00:01:01.259> that<00:01:01.290> sometimes

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
movements the notion is that sometimes

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.590 
movements the notion is that sometimes
you<00:01:02.369> want<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:03.210> that's<00:01:03.360> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you want to do something that's so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
you want to do something that's so
really<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.229> precise<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> tiny<00:01:05.220> laser

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
really really precise that a tiny laser

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.469 
really really precise that a tiny laser
cut<00:01:05.970> let's<00:01:06.240> say<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.939> devices

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
cut let's say well this these devices

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.270 
cut let's say well this these devices
allow<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.080> change<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> settings<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
allow you to change the settings on it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.399 
allow you to change the settings on it
so<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:12.000> propel<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.570> device<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.200> two

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so you could propel this device in two

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.499 
so you could propel this device in two
inches<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> output<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> along<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.329> cut

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
inches but on the output it along it cut

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.679 
inches but on the output it along it cut
something<00:01:15.799> 2007<00:01:16.880> meet<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> world's<00:01:18.390> first

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
something 2007 meet the world's first

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410

don't see the future being filled with

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.870 
don't see the future being filled with
robots<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:26.980> are<00:03:27.040> indistinguishable<00:03:27.459> from

humans<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.720> don't<00:03:28.989> think<00:03:29.200> that's<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.500> way<00:03:29.739> to

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
humans I don't think that's the way to

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.259 
humans I don't think that's the way to
look<00:03:30.010> at<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:30.519> our<00:03:30.790> first<00:03:31.030> prototype

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
look at it that's our first prototype

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.710 
look at it that's our first prototype
out<00:03:31.630> there<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.019> mean<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:33.150> would<00:03:34.150> view<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.390> at<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
out there I mean we would view it at a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.539 
out there I mean we would view it at a
beginning<00:03:35.080> like<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.320> human<00:03:35.799> right<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:35.980> way<00:03:36.310> we

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
beginning like a human right the way we

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.250 
beginning like a human right the way we
didn't<00:03:36.760> see<00:03:36.850> any<00:03:37.000> value<00:03:37.150> from<00:03:37.420> doing<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.840> she

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
didn't see any value from doing that she

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.949 
didn't see any value from doing that she
good<00:03:38.530> at<00:03:38.560> things<00:03:38.950> like<00:03:39.160> remember<00:03:40.120> 5,000

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
people faces I can't do that they got me

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.910 
people faces I can't do that they got me
good<00:03:43.810> at<00:03:43.959> things<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.260> didn't<00:03:44.560> let<00:03:44.709> me<00:03:44.799> good

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
good at things that I didn't let me good

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.310 
good at things that I didn't let me good
at<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.340> good<00:03:45.519> at<00:03:45.700> look<00:03:46.600> robotic

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
at this one good at look robotic

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.949 
at this one good at look robotic
techniques<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:48.370> are<00:03:48.549> advancing<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.330> much<00:03:49.570> in

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
techniques now are advancing so much in

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.509 
techniques now are advancing so much in
the<00:03:50.080> end<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.380> robots<00:03:50.769> are<00:03:50.890> going<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.100> win<00:03:51.250> but

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
the end the robots are going to win but

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.100 
the end the robots are going to win but
this<00:03:51.670> will<00:03:51.910> free<00:03:52.180> people<00:03:52.600> up<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.930> do<00:03:53.080> other

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
this will free people up to do other

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.960 
this will free people up to do other
things<00:03:53.350> I'm<00:03:53.950> not<00:03:54.220> afraid<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.610> it
