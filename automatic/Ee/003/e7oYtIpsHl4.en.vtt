full<00:00:45.329> tosses<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.020> managed<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
full tosses which I managed to get to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.990 
full tosses which I managed to get to
the<00:00:46.739> boundary<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> got<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.700> bit

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the boundary so I got there a little bit

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
the boundary so I got there a little bit
quicker<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:49.140> celebration<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.800> probably<00:00:50.100> as

particularly remember no I mean I got

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
particularly remember no I mean I got
they're<00:01:08.130> all<00:01:08.250> special<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> come<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.390> by

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
they're all special when you come up by

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.530 
they're all special when you come up by
here<00:01:09.720> no<00:01:09.810> matter<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.470> opposition

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
here no matter what the opposition

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.149 
here no matter what the opposition
against<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.170> situation<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> match

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
against what the situation in the match

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.859 
against what the situation in the match
but<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.610> score<00:01:14.909> two<00:01:15.090> against<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> West<00:01:15.689> Indies

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but I score two against the West Indies

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.160 
but I score two against the West Indies
in<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> match<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> guess<00:01:16.740> those<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:18.170> would

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
in a match so I guess those two would

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
in a match so I guess those two would
have<00:01:19.290> been<00:01:19.409> hired<00:01:20.100> there

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
have been hired there

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.830 
have been hired there
I<00:01:20.610> scored<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.030> hundred<00:01:21.119> ice<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> last

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I scored a hundred ice in the last

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.179 
I scored a hundred ice in the last
hundred<00:01:21.960> Freeman<00:01:22.409> against<00:01:22.650> New<00:01:22.770> Zealand<00:01:23.100> when

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
hundred Freeman against New Zealand when

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.550 
hundred Freeman against New Zealand when
I<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.400> completely<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.119> form<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.720> think

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I was completely out of form I think

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.480 
I was completely out of form I think
when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.830> wondered<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> know

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
when you get wondered when you know

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
when you get wondered when you know
you're<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> form<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:27.960> 30<00:01:28.350> runs

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you're out of form in the first 30 runs

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
you're out of form in the first 30 runs
against<00:01:28.890> New<00:01:29.009> Zealand<00:01:29.070> we're<00:01:29.490> ugly<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.270> know

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
against New Zealand we're ugly you know

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
against New Zealand we're ugly you know
they<00:01:30.479> were<00:01:30.540> off<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> edge<00:01:30.930> inside<00:01:31.829> edge

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they were off the edge inside edge

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.789 
they were off the edge inside edge
through<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> slips<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> guess<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> New

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
through the slips so I guess that New

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.810 
through the slips so I guess that New
Zealand<00:01:35.189> hundred<00:01:35.460> would<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.700> been<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
Zealand hundred would have been a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
Zealand hundred would have been a
