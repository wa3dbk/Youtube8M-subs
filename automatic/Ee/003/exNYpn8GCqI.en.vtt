asking me about products for greasy skin
I<00:04:37.000> usually<00:04:37.419> recommend<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.900> aloe<00:04:38.080> lotion<00:04:38.380> as

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
I usually recommend the aloe lotion as

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.640 
I usually recommend the aloe lotion as
opposed<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> moisturizing<00:04:40.120> lotion<00:04:40.650> that

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
opposed to the moisturizing lotion that

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.370 
opposed to the moisturizing lotion that
contains<00:04:41.680> lanolin<00:04:42.610> instead<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.479> collagen<00:04:44.229> and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
contains lanolin instead of collagen and

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.860 
contains lanolin instead of collagen and
elastin<00:04:45.070> in<00:04:45.280> this<00:04:45.550> one<00:04:45.759> so<00:04:46.180> that's<00:04:46.389> really<00:04:46.600> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
elastin in this one so that's really the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.719 
elastin in this one so that's really the
skincare<00:04:47.229> routine<00:04:47.800> that<00:04:48.039> I<00:04:48.100> would<00:04:48.310> recommend

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729
