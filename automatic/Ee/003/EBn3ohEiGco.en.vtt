packing<00:02:00.240> them<00:02:00.649> in<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.009> replace<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.820> bushings

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
packing them in and replace the bushings

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.260 
packing them in and replace the bushings
that<00:02:03.719> came<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> tempters<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:06.060> just

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that came to the tempters and just just

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
that came to the tempters and just just
so<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> made<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> lot<00:02:07.049> better<00:02:07.320> once<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> did

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
so it made them a lot better once I did

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.490 
so it made them a lot better once I did
that<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.399> pretty<00:02:08.640> good<00:02:09.200> yeah<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.379> only

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
that it was pretty good yeah the only

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.930 
that it was pretty good yeah the only
thing<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.009> bones<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
thing about the bones the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
thing about the bones the
versions<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.780> isn't<00:02:12.960> about<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
versions I know this isn't about a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.050 
versions I know this isn't about a
refill<00:02:14.160> about<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> bushings<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> only

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
refill about the bushings but the only

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.760 
refill about the bushings but the only
thing<00:02:15.270> about<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> bones<00:02:15.750> bushings<00:02:16.140> they<00:02:16.620> are

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
thing about the bones bushings they are

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.250 
thing about the bones bushings they are
very<00:02:17.070> expensive<00:02:17.490> that<00:02:18.270> they're<00:02:18.540> six<00:02:18.810> pounds

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
very expensive that they're six pounds

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.580 
very expensive that they're six pounds
per<00:02:19.770> track<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.760> four<00:02:21.060> bushings<00:02:21.450> thus<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
per track and four bushings thus that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.220 
per track and four bushings thus that
it's<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.100> money<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> pay<00:02:24.050> anyway<00:02:25.050> back

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it's a lot of money to pay anyway back

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.000 
it's a lot of money to pay anyway back
to<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> trucks

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to the trucks

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
to the trucks
the<00:02:26.610> only<00:02:26.850> other<00:02:27.060> problem<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.600> had<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:27.960> my

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the only other problem I had with my

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.820 
the only other problem I had with my
trust<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.630> staff<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.440> I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
trust is that what them staff and I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.560 
trust is that what them staff and I
wasn't<00:02:32.250> even<00:02:32.400> doing<00:02:32.700> anything<00:02:32.790> being<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.420> think

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
wasn't even doing anything being I think

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.940 
wasn't even doing anything being I think
it<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.080> kick<00:02:34.290> flip<00:02:34.470> off<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it was like a kick flip off like a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.430 
it was like a kick flip off like a
two-foot<00:02:35.460> ledge<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:36.030> maybe<00:02:36.990> not<00:02:37.110> even<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
two-foot ledge or maybe not even that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.390 
two-foot ledge or maybe not even that
and<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:39.630> what<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.260> did<00:02:40.410> they<00:02:40.440> strapped<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and and what they did they strapped the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.140 
and and what they did they strapped the
round<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:43.050> around<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.620> bit<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.940> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
round well around this bit here but I I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.460 
round well around this bit here but I I
really<00:02:45.360> don't<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.930> what<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> called

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
really don't know what this is called

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.210 
really don't know what this is called
gonna<00:02:47.340> go<00:02:47.610> at<00:02:47.730> me<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.920> either<00:02:50.070> be

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
gonna go at me that it can either be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.190 
gonna go at me that it can either be
from<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:50.940> hitting<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> against<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> curbs

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
from like hitting it against the curbs

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.530 
from like hitting it against the curbs
thoughts<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.010> luck<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.670> happy<00:02:53.910> having<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
thoughts and luck just happy having that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
thoughts and luck just happy having that
one<00:02:54.860> one<00:02:55.860> time<00:02:56.160> around<00:02:56.400> something<00:02:56.820> it

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
one one time around something it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
one one time around something it
eventually<00:02:57.420> given<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.140> or<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.220> could<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.430> be

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
eventually given in or it could just be

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.250 
eventually given in or it could just be
because<00:02:59.820> they<00:03:00.420> couldn't<00:03:00.660> withstand<00:03:00.930> my

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
because they couldn't withstand my

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.740 
because they couldn't withstand my
weight<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.950> they're<00:03:02.130> not<00:03:03.060> saying<00:03:03.330> I'm<00:03:03.510> some

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
weight so they're not saying I'm some

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.150 
weight so they're not saying I'm some
sort<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:04.170> super<00:03:04.800> obese<00:03:05.040> person<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:08.010> know

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
sort of super obese person that you know

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.410 
sort of super obese person that you know
they<00:03:08.460> they<00:03:08.850> might<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.480> able<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:10.160> hold<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
they they might not be able to hold and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.010 
they they might not be able to hold and
some<00:03:12.780> people<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.500> mean<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.570> don't<00:03:15.570> think<00:03:15.840> it

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
some people but I mean I don't think it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.510 
some people but I mean I don't think it
could<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.739> think<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.190> more<00:03:17.400> or

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
could be because I think it's more or

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.050 
could be because I think it's more or
less<00:03:17.550> because<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:19.290> aren't<00:03:19.470> us<00:03:19.620> from

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
less because they aren't us from

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.699 
less because they aren't us from
assembly<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.450> trucks<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:22.020> in<00:03:22.350> these

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
assembly and the trucks like in these

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.520 
assembly and the trucks like in these
are<00:03:22.920> oils<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:26.720> mean<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:27.900> pretty<00:03:28.050> much<00:03:28.170> it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530
