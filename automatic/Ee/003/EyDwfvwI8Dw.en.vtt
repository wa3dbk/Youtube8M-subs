00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I welcome everyone to the review channel on 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.769
 stool we will have today 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.320
 experiment and it's called arachnophobia 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 Ie fear spiders for those who not 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.449
 knows so we see here we are sitting in 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 some room at the table in front of us 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.550
 here are safety warnings so 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 window of some huge axis city 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.280
 visibility of new york so that us booklets 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 I see spiders different here is a poster 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.539
 spider bite symptoms something central 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.329
 muscle headache cramps 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.329
 heart rate rhythm 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 systemic 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.090
 stomach pain 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 like a world of nausea on the skin maybe a rash 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:11.040
 and redness and other things 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 manifestations of pain temperature fever and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 so then let's start what 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.680
 here is some more piece of paper for that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.640
 to have more spiders look at 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.180
 red strip to reduce by 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.400
 green looks very similar from the same 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.130
 whether or not the developers don't let go 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 Well, maybe I 'm wrong because we still have here 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:41.490
 first aid kit 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:46.439
 Well, we proceed and so we have the first 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.549
 level and I do not know how terrible it is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.750
 experience so we had one spider 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.300
 Well, the spider in the bank he moves so 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.520
 we don't have anything else 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.760
 Like there is no that we increase the level of fear 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.940
 so we look we look 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:15.700
 so level two surprise me so 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.700
 the bank became more spiders became three 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.840
 not scary not scary and not knowing the same 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.660
 someone who has panic fear 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.940
 spiders will be scared but it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.070
 it is somehow weak in my opinion so would 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:36.280
 nowhere else is there any regiments 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.280
 degree 3 level 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:45.410
 Well, so spiders already without cans one right 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.750
 next another a little away so spiders 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.870
 no more of us reminds you something 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.090
 know some kind of combat simulator 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.030
 fear that is if you have panic 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.860
 fear of spiders here you are like that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 adapt you get used but it 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.280
 absolutely not scary experience for anyone 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.070
 all this is not such phobias at all possible 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.739
 to abstract that this is all virtual 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.840
 even if you're up to when untying not 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.970
 take it to spiders 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.290
 scare at least on climb on hand no 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.920
 Well, well , something does not want to climb 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.920
 let's raise the level of fear well 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 fourth level 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.959
 so waiting for what will be spiders 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:38.780
 it became noticeably more became more 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.900
 a little bit they are not lazy at all 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.800
 a bit of something somehow somehow weak on my 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.560
 let's look right up on the fifth 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.950
 level I hope that there will be something from 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.650
 There might be some screamers with 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.840
 jumping on their faces about them has become more and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.910
 it became more but not only on the table but no 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.239
 he still on the poster they appeared he 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.080
 a huge spider crawling but it's all far away 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:13.000
 on the body they do not pause 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.520
 knowing in my opinion this is some kind of omission 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.650
 developers 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.870
 how much is it scary by the way and more 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.260
 we canâ€™t increase passions 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:32.040
 campaign is all well and Experience I 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:34.900
 I can say the idea well maybe 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.750
 foursome can be put as such 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.600
 gums simulator combat fears 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.950
 implementation it is absolutely not scary not 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.600
 we know neither at least for sure it is threefold 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.300
 grafonchik taxi a mediocre 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.210
 my mind can put this 3.8 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.910
 how such an experience variant is it 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.280
 there is a place to be but to say that it is there 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.650
 super scary or super interesting i'm not 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 I can generally something like this if you 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.730
