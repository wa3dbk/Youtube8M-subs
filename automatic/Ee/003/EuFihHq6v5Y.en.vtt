00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hey people today i have the sunny at 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.109
 me from the channel xp power and become today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.240
 a video on uni white school 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.040
 Some of you are still going to school 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 or even to the university or are just 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.160
 so in the middle phase between us and us 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 Today you just want the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 differences a bit much 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 and you can also java me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 who stop by one of a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 very cool faq shot so me 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.039
 Link this in the infobox and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 you can also make the most of it 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 the first difference is on everyone 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
 If ever, that's the big deal 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 Although the climate in the school is such that we 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 every two months write clauss 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 but accordingly, the fabric is too 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.770
 not so much and in the unis is like that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.210
 that while you write only one klausur 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.360
 but almost the whole semester 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 That's why you sometimes have it together 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 500 to even 800 mg that is it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 you have to learn from the side 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 The next point is friendship in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 The school has a lot of clicks 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.579
 and they sometimes have each other 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.270
 stress and there are even many 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.219
 rumors 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.780
 the new has an ice cold dress 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.440
 So bought later with which I speak even 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 no more 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 Anja Unis, for example, is like that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 somehow hangs around with number but 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.470
 somehow you are interested now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.119
 not so much for the others or 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 sometimes people can not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:23.189
 who sit next to you and the next one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 point is the theme outfit so in the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 It is very often so that you school 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 can put on what you want where you go 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.380
 you feel good and you are so kind 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 so the want to disconnect the newest 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.790
 But you wanted to have it but what exactly 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.049
 in the university I have the feeling today 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.170
 they all have one too 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.479
 found a little bit and are also totally 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 extrovert or they retire 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.680
 according to your degree course at the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.409
 example, many people who also wear bdn 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.250
 Also like a suit or a shirt 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.840
 or a blouse 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.030
 the next point is the timetable 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 when in school he is full every day 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
 school until 4 o'clock 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.370
 and there is still never there it can be 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 pass that they 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.800
 only on Mondays and Tuesdays uni or 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.260
 twice a week three times a week and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.540
 you do not even have to go 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.310
 which is also very pleasant 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.190
 the last point on our list is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.290
 the topic of several professors 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.000
 At school, the teachers push them 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 know the name and want too 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.620
 really that you give everything you us 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.060
 Show understand his mobile away me 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.540
 just trying to explain something 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.670
 leave in June, it is whether you go 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.700
 Hits or who you are 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.520
 do not know the name and talk too 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.500
 no matter because everyone else is loud then 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.950
 just do not care if you're lecturing 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.920
 someone listens at a kg or ohg there 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:53.200
 it continues on clauses they grab 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.450
 if a shareholder bull has me 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.860
 now like this video and write 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 also like to once again approached him 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.080
 twitter facebook pages win everything 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.640
 past the hashtag bio tigris because 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.550
 we never have this video at home 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.900
 just feel it 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.340
 and yes, you do not even look 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.440
 past the trade also a video shot 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.300
 or at party who supported us 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.230
 and otherwise have a nice day 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.230
 and till then
