00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
really simple so I'm just going to start

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.350 
really simple so I'm just going to start
one<00:00:32.820> over<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.390> new<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> grab<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
one over here new going to grab a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.430 
one over here new going to grab a
triangle<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> kind<00:00:37.380> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
triangle and we're going to kind of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
triangle and we're going to kind of
widen<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> base<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.090> free

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
widen the base just a little bit so free

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
widen the base just a little bit so free
transform<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.500> bit<00:00:40.620> bigger

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
transform so it's a little bit bigger

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
transform so it's a little bit bigger
but<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.219> too<00:00:41.460> big<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> fill<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> screen

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
but not too big to fill up the screen

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.779 
but not too big to fill up the screen
because<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.750> still<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.079> space<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
because we still need space for the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.139 
because we still need space for the
circles<00:00:44.899> here<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.149> just

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
circles here in a little bit and just

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
circles here in a little bit and just
kind<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> make<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.690> perfect<00:00:49.140> dear<00:00:49.469> copy<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
kind of make it perfect dear copy and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
kind of make it perfect dear copy and
paste<00:00:50.610> we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> flip<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.510> turn<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
paste we're going to flip it and turn it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
paste we're going to flip it and turn it
completely<00:00:52.020> upside<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
completely upside down so that way the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
completely upside down so that way the
parts<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.500> completely<00:00:56.129> equal<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.760> each<00:00:56.879> other

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
parts are completely equal to each other

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.040 
parts are completely equal to each other
and<00:00:58.190> then<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.309> got<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> try<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> get<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> flat<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and then we got to try to get it flat so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.980 
and then we got to try to get it flat so
that<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.500> crooked<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:04.170> little<00:01:04.460> bit<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
that it's not crooked a little bit of a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
that it's not crooked a little bit of a
tweaking<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.310> got

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
tweaking here and there now we just got

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
tweaking here and there now we just got
to<00:01:08.490> simply<00:01:08.909> copy<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.630> paste<00:01:10.229> we're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to simply copy and paste we're going to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039 
to simply copy and paste we're going to

to blue remember we gotta make sure that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.830 
to blue remember we gotta make sure that
the<00:01:43.310> edges<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.850> straight<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.810> flat<00:01:47.659> okay<00:01:48.659> now

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the edges are straight and flat okay now

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.270 
we're going to get the bullet
thingamajigger<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> bullet<00:01:52.680> logo<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
thingamajigger here is bullet logo and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780 
thingamajigger here is bullet logo and
we're<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> make<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.369> pretty<00:01:56.369> big<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
we're going to make it pretty big and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.719 
we're going to make it pretty big and
we're<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.360> red<00:01:58.490> same<00:01:59.490> right<00:01:59.700> as

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
we're going to make it red same right as

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.469 
we're going to make it red same right as
we<00:01:59.939> had<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> background<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:03.030> we're

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
we had the background and then we're

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.179 
we had the background and then we're
going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> copy<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> paste<00:02:04.500> we're<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
going to copy and paste we're going to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
going to copy and paste we're going to
make<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.729> white<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:06.990> we're<00:02:07.079> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
make this one white and then we're going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.550 
make this one white and then we're going
to<00:02:07.229> toggle<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> outline<00:02:08.729> fill<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.899> actually

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
to toggle the outline fill and actually

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900 
to toggle the outline fill and actually
hold<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> got<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.310> bigger<00:02:11.670> really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
hold on I got to make this bigger really

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.760 
hold on I got to make this bigger really
quick<00:02:12.270> that's<00:02:12.810> what<00:02:12.989> she<00:02:13.170> said

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
quick that's what she said

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.760 
quick that's what she said
and<00:02:14.600> there<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.690> go<00:02:15.870> there's<00:02:16.200> how<00:02:16.380> much<00:02:16.590> of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and there you go there's how much of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.620 
and there you go there's how much of
that<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> done<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> doesn't<00:02:18.120> look<00:02:18.390> too

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that is done now this doesn't look too

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.140 
that is done now this doesn't look too
great<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:20.250> know<00:02:20.340> there's<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> three

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
great so you know there's the three

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.440 
great so you know there's the three
little<00:02:21.930> circle<00:02:22.350> things<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.920> got<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.190> do

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
little circle things that we got to do

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.180 
little circle things that we got to do
to<00:02:24.450> add<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> slow<00:02:25.500> way<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> adds<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to add on to this slow way it adds a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.710 
to add on to this slow way it adds a
little<00:02:26.310> bit<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.550> texture<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.240> basically

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
little bit of texture to it basically

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190 
little bit of texture to it basically
now<00:02:28.590> we're<00:02:28.710> going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.200> elongated

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
now we're going to make it elongated

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
now we're going to make it elongated
we're<00:02:31.740> going<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.920> free<00:02:32.070> transform<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.580> not

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
we're going to free transform it not

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.420 
we're going to free transform it not
quite<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.540> big<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.530> then<00:02:35.160> we're

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
quite that big like that and then we're

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.670 
quite that big like that and then we're
just<00:02:35.460> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> make<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.000> bigger<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:37.110> slightly

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
just going to make it bigger so slightly

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.930 
just going to make it bigger so slightly
ovular<00:02:38.460> slightly<00:02:39.500> egg-shaped<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.640> this

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ovular slightly egg-shaped and this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220 
ovular slightly egg-shaped and this
one's<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.540> white<00:02:42.720> move<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.140> all

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
one's just going to be white move it all

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.960 
one's just going to be white move it all
the<00:02:43.260> way<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> front<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.760> back

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the way to the front so it's in back

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.390 
the way to the front so it's in back
behind<00:02:45.150> everything<00:02:45.510> copy<00:02:46.500> paste<00:02:46.800> make<00:02:47.250> this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
behind everything copy paste make this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.250 
behind everything copy paste make this
one<00:02:47.640> red<00:02:47.850> we're<00:02:48.480> going<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> keep<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:48.990> that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
one red we're going to keep going that

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
one red we're going to keep going that
order<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:49.770> had<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
order that we had going with the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.640 
order that we had going with the
triangles<00:02:51.510> size<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.080> down<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.530> bit

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
triangles size it down just a little bit

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.530 
triangles size it down just a little bit
we're<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> move<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.090> back<00:02:54.300> behind

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
we're going to move this back behind

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.170 
we're going to move this back behind
everything<00:02:54.960> else<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.910> will<00:02:56.910> move<00:02:57.150> back

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
everything else so that will move back

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
everything else so that will move back
behind<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.600> triangles<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.110> way<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.500> still

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
behind the triangles that way it still

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.530 
behind the triangles that way it still
keeps<00:02:59.070> with<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.310> design<00:02:59.640> I'm<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.360> copy

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
keeps with the design I'm going to copy

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.060 
keeps with the design I'm going to copy
and<00:03:00.840> paste<00:03:01.020> one<00:03:01.320> more<00:03:01.500> time<00:03:01.740> we're<00:03:01.890> going<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and paste one more time we're going to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.840 
and paste one more time we're going to
get<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> blue<00:03:03.560> again<00:03:04.560> last<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:05.550> gonna<00:03:05.700> say

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
get the blue again last I'm gonna say

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.160 
get the blue again last I'm gonna say
this<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.210> can<00:03:06.330> choose<00:03:06.480> whatever<00:03:06.660> colors<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
this you can choose whatever colors you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.980 
this you can choose whatever colors you
want<00:03:07.320> doesn't<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.990> alright

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
want doesn't have to be this alright

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.990 
want doesn't have to be this alright
move<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.320> back<00:03:10.500> behind<00:03:10.770> everything<00:03:11.370> again

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
move this back behind everything again

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.690 
move this back behind everything again
I'm<00:03:12.720> just<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.110> make<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.320> smaller<00:03:13.700> Bay

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I'm just going to make it smaller Bay

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.950 
I'm just going to make it smaller Bay
out<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.150> doesn't<00:03:15.300> really<00:03:15.420> matter<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.870> can

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
out it doesn't really matter you can

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.720 
out it doesn't really matter you can
choose<00:03:16.110> whatever<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.040> feel<00:03:17.400> best

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
choose whatever way you feel best

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.240 
choose whatever way you feel best
displays<00:03:18.150> what<00:03:18.390> you're<00:03:18.540> doing<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.250> then

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
displays what you're doing and then

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.080 
displays what you're doing and then
we're<00:03:20.700> simply<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.630> grab<00:03:21.930> us<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.410> star

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
we're simply going to grab us a star

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.140 
we're simply going to grab us a star
we're<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.270> replicate<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> six<00:03:25.410> times<00:03:26.150> so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
we're going to replicate it six times so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.630 
we're going to replicate it six times so
there's<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.959> really<00:03:28.200> anything<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.709> say<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
there's not really anything to say I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.570 
there's not really anything to say I
don't<00:03:30.300> get<00:03:30.450> no<00:03:30.680> jokes<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.860> adding<00:03:32.130> some<00:03:32.280> stars

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
don't get no jokes for adding some stars

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.990 
don't get no jokes for adding some stars
to<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.959> know<00:03:34.140> there's<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:35.400> much<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.970> it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
to this you know there's not much to it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
behind it so that it looks like it has a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.070 
behind it so that it looks like it has a
shadowing<00:04:08.820> effect<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:09.959> that

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080
