00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 researchers in various parts of the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.000
 warning of an environmental problem 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 which can directly reach the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.410
 food production capacity 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 bees are disappearing from the face of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 Earth 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 the reduction of hives was verified 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.539
 on several continents and has already reached 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.220
 Brazil in a worrisome way 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 to reverse the picture was released a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 campaign for the preservation of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.109
 bees 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 there are several causes of this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.500
 several problems such as 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 some diseases of bacterial viruses 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 pesticides, neither the principles nor the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.809
 continue to say that they are extremely 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.739
 poisonous bees and that the reason for 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.940
 of their disappearance. 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.860
 disappearance of bees has as 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 first consequence of the lack of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.230
 foods because 70% of the food you eat 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.649
 we eat depends on pollination 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 bees and it is not the bees not 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.989
 They punish only pollinate plants 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.290
 produce food they pollinate 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.080
 plants in general the green areas and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.479
 green areas produce oxygen and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 if the green areas disappear we'll go 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.970
 also end up succumbing for lack of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 Oxygen was a prediction 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.869
 of a great scientist 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.350
 albert einstein which is based on eheheheh 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.439
 analysis of bees saying that if a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.280
 bees disappeared on the face of the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.720
 Earth 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.780
 soon afterwards the men also 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 unfortunately the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.159
 disappearance is already occurring is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 This is what we have for this great 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.079
 and we made a campaign of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.570
 bee protection 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.049
 the campaign be or not to be without bees 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.460
 in food she has some goals the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.170
 first of them is to raise awareness of the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.369
 population for the importance of bees 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.860
 so the bees in pollination do not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.479
 food and because of this we have to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.570
 protect the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.610
 according to we have created a petition in favor 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.429
 of the bees to which we invite 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 all people who are lovers do not 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 being the bees to enter into our 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.170
 website and so neither by this petition to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.270
 what 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 and we can have a political force 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.910
 to get where that 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.489
 importance to all 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.140
 political and social representations 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.640
 It's that they can work, let's go for it. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.860
 we are also developing 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.319
 an educational work 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.010
 still behind school vaccines 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.920
 teaching where so to your students 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.580
 children about the importance of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.290
 bees 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.989
 we want to form citizens 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.420
 conscientious citizens who understand 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.160
 the importance of the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.989
 biodiversity and understand the importance 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.950
 bees within all of our 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.769
 ecosystem 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.019
 we should put more emphasis on 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.750
 biological control instead of using 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.100
 chemicals or agrochemicals or 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.650
 pesticides 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.760
 according to us one must increase the various 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.780
 must protect the environment 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.239
 help you plant plants that are 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.180
 interest of the bees in order to 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.150
 reproduction and they can also increase 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.510
 in number and there are also some 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.040
 problems that are the direct 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.799
 power supply we have to ensure the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.910
 food for man and if we lose 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.650
 the bees 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.459
 we will be the first to be 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.459
 impaired
