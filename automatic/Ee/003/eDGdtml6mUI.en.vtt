00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.650
 skin for combination skin 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.060
 well we will say that I have a mixed skin 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.170
 with the delicious fragrance of chocolate the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.420
 advice of use it is necessary to clean 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.890
 the face and neck you start to 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.690
 know thoroughly with hot water 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.449
 you must not leave in and you have to 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.449
 apply the farm regularly grown from 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.190
 fingertips on the wet skin of 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.079
 face and neck let act for 10 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.789
 at 15 minutes and rinse the mask with 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.749
 taxi water without eye contact 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.479
 must be thoroughly rinsed 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.690
 so I'm going to remove my makeup and I'm going 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.460
 come back apply it to you all of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.370
 sequel and cuckoo girls here I am again 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.609
 girls with cleansing skin cleanse 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.700
 and still wet I opened the pot 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.500
 Finally the plastic actually there it 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.079
 smells very strong chocolate it looks 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.009
 to be a pretty dry dough a little 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.479
 stuff that's spending so it's a foul 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 who's brown is ok enough 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 consistent with the nature of the product 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:34.359
 there are not some masses it looks like a 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:38.460
 little to a chocolate mousse hop this is 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.460
 something valadas and pasty actually 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.859
 it really looks like the spread 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.090
 that I put myself at the instant tax the 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.829
 sensation is a sensation a little 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.579
 fresh because in my bathroom 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 it was not very hot 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.429
 on the other hand now the smell is a little 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.360
 a little too loud it was a little too much 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.770
 strong chocolate by cons it's not 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.080
 it's not unpleasant but it's not no 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 what more pleasant when we said 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.019
 we really feel like it's 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.970
 super strong super strong chocolate 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:23.750
 that we took a I do not know how I 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:25.560
 frame then already it's rather nice 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.540
 so for now I have no 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.459
 feeling of tingling or heat neither 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.810
 two I do not know if it's supposed to harden g 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.680
 page and I seem not to have read that they 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.680
 had clay in there 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.620
 no it is something that is supposed 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.780
 hydrated so there is chocolate mud 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.140
 so it's cocoa butter too 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.880
 drummer and the salts of the Dead Sea so 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.459
 it will purify and hydrate my skin like 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.049
 I said so I'm supposed to leave 10 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.400
 to 15 minutes in my opinion I will shoot 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.769
 about 15 minutes unless the smell 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.620
 becomes too embarrassing but see 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.440
 the application was super easy was 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.760
 since it's something quite 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.280
 looks a little like modeling clay in 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.220
 party or spread as 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.329
 roll up so I'm going to let it act a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.459
 a quarter of an hour gibel a chocolate 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.630
 good smell here is a fake must love the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.739
 chocolate because it smells very very 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.660
 strong so I find again just now 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.100
 in 15 minutes right away 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.560
 girls 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.829
 hello girls so here I am after 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.329
 a big fifteen minutes to leave mouais 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.079
 put the mask 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.170
 so as you can see I 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.150
 go a little frozen he has a little bit 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.319
 a lot to dry in fact there is no 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.540
 of clay in it but he still 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.079
 really dry then I think that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.880
 it is there that purifying action is 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.010
 absorbing my sebum and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.260
 impurities through not what 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.090
 but hardening and I think it's 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.870
 all appearance after kaka over 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.700
 some tiles and cocoa that will do 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.590
 the moisturizing action so 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.270
 the only feeling that I have it scratches me 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.459
 it does not sting me it does not change 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.129
 it's not cold actually it's me 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.019
 tug a little because it was drying 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.640
 so I just did when I move 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.400
 like that it makes me feel a little looked 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.260
 years a really but frankly a 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.910
 mask that we forget easily finally 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.350
 that we forget we still feel 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.639
 the smell 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.410
 there is a smell but I was 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.050
 watched some videos on youtube and 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.340
 I drank I started drinking my tea and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.070
 frankly I have not seen the quarter of an hour 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.020
 who parade what so I'm going 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.220
 now rinse it and then I come back 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.830
 right now to give you my 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.750
 impressions came after the mask 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.720
 many girls so here I am at the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.280
 face to reims and I'm a little scruffy 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.919
 also this not there then to the giant lift 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.750
 finally with difficulty no it was when 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.460
 even rather well rinse but cons 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.960
 we go crazy everywhere in the washbasin 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.360
 suddenly did I wash my sink there 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.790
 I had marmont stuff from all over 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.800
 then as usual after at any 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.070
 what are abnormally your skin is 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.510
 very soft so good there lÃ© all clear 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.430
 see where it was really very dry 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.270
 I just have a little reaction on the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.800
 moment because I have sensitive skin 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.960
 so I'm just a little pink 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.100
 otherwise, but here it was 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.650
 really where it had been 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.479
 to dry I have a bit here in my opinion 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.800
 in 10 minutes I have nothing left then the 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.780
 skin is very sweet I still have the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.600
 complexion I do not eat it notes that I have the 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.010
 dyed brighter lightened the face 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.979
 more awake I had left a small 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.010
 little more marked just now after at 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.690
 hydration level 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.520
 I would not really say it does not hydrate 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.100
 background of blur here in my opinion it's okay 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.260
 clean the skin well I think yeah 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400
 on the other hand at the level of hydration I 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.789
 sense anyway the need to put a 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.270
 little moisturizer so to see again 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:52.410
 on the word hydration 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.590
 but otherwise that's where it smells more smell 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.530
 left you did you see 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.700
 a difference no this is a trick 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.470
 that I will retry because I like 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.690
 the chocolate I found in addition to the 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.190
 nice color the effect that it was the 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.580
 also makes it last more than five 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.500
 minutes 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.090
 so it's a real care mask where we 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.250
 can go to relax a little bit and 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.960
 forget what we have on the face and then 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.500
 yes here I liked it I found it 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.210
 nice to redo for I think that 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.530
 it's more frank than you are 1 99 also I 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.480
 believe something like that the care seems 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.430
 than the others so I show you them 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.730
 it is the chocolate mask waste and 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.020
 same marc that I will probably buy back the 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.220
 next time I dropped my je me 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.570
 will make a small dot and then a small 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.740
 full and I will think of you I think that 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.510
 I would have bought a lot more quote 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.050
 they play the fees I wanted 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.100
 would win 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.870
 in fact in 2013 it's going to be a start 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.830
 of year competition because everyone 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.150
 made contests in December 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.130
 I said I will try to stand out 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.060
 a little bit and do it earlier in january 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.370
 since in january it's my 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.920
 birthday so suddenly I'm going to do 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.820
 pleasure to everyone 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.290
 making me enjoy all 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.340
 so here I am not going to bother you anymore 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.660
 long time I have not much to say 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.640
 on it if it's actually it's 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.530
 a very nice sound I think it has me 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.750
 to clean the face well it does not 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.300
 really hydrated but it was a care 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.650
 fun and fun to do again and 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.740
 then I recommend it if you want 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.940
 a little a nice little moment not 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.990
 the age we make big kisses and I 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.990
 tell tomorrow in girls
