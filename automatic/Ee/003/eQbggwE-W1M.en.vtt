other downside to this weapon is it has

your advantage medium range is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.340 
your advantage medium range is
definitely<00:02:30.720> where<00:02:30.870> you're<00:02:30.990> going<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.170> want<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
definitely where you're going to want to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.570 
definitely where you're going to want to
be<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.620> take<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:31.950> shots<00:02:32.220> it'll<00:02:32.490> be

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
be to take your shots it'll be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.430 
be to take your shots it'll be
competitive<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.870> advantage<00:02:34.260> over

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
competitive and have the advantage over

the<00:02:34.650> majority<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.130> guns<00:02:35.490> long<00:02:36.090> range<00:02:36.300> it'll<00:02:36.570> be

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the majority of guns long range it'll be

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.270 
the majority of guns long range it'll be
slow<00:02:36.900> again<00:02:37.170> which<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
slow again which is not really that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.280 
slow again which is not really that
great<00:02:38.460> because<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.150> long-range<00:02:39.690> combats

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
great because in long-range combats

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.870 
great because in long-range combats
you're<00:02:40.440> either<00:02:40.560> dealing<00:02:40.980> with<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> sniper<00:02:41.520> or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
you're either dealing with a sniper or

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
you're either dealing with a sniper or
another<00:02:42.180> AR<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.230> want<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> upper

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
another AR so you want to have the upper

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.760 
another AR so you want to have the upper
hand<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.730> gun<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.210> long<00:02:45.630> range<00:02:46.020> won't

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
hand but this gun at long range won't

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.410 
hand but this gun at long range won't
really<00:02:47.040> give<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.910> being<00:02:48.150> said

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
really give it to you that being said

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.490 
really give it to you that being said
though<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:48.750> saying<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.200> close

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
though I'm not saying that close

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.290 
though I'm not saying that close
quarters<00:02:49.890> combat<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.460> long-range<00:02:50.940> combat

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
quarters combat and long-range combat

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.210 
quarters combat and long-range combat
are<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.930> attainable<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.590> get<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> lot<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
are not attainable I get in a lot of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
are not attainable I get in a lot of
situations<00:02:53.460> where<00:02:54.300> i<00:02:54.330> will<00:02:54.540> outgun<00:02:55.050> people

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
situations where i will outgun people

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.870 
situations where i will outgun people
with<00:02:55.440> an<00:02:55.530> SMG<00:02:55.860> close<00:02:56.250> quarters<00:02:56.610> simply

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
with an SMG close quarters simply

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
with an SMG close quarters simply
because<00:02:57.180> i<00:02:57.360> have<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> better<00:02:57.990> reaction<00:02:58.290> time

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
because i have a better reaction time

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.830 
because i have a better reaction time
better<00:02:58.920> accuracy<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.820> I<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.480> step

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
better accuracy and I just have to step

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.420 
better accuracy and I just have to step
up<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.230> them<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.770> long-range<00:03:02.040> it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
up on them same with long-range it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.100 
up on them same with long-range it's
actually<00:03:02.940> still<00:03:03.150> very<00:03:03.480> possible<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.020> get

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
actually still very possible to get

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.290 
actually still very possible to get
these<00:03:04.260> kills<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.490> not<00:03:05.550> tailored

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
these kills but it's just not tailored

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.970 
these kills but it's just not tailored
to<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.960> gun<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.200> made<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.620> now<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
like I use cancel a lot on this gun

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.940 
like I use cancel a lot on this gun
because<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.960> will<00:03:19.080> spot<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.470> enemies<00:03:19.770> say

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
because I will spot on enemies say

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.440 
because I will spot on enemies say
really<00:03:20.250> close<00:03:20.460> to<00:03:20.610> me<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.880> then<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> will<00:03:21.360> get

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
really close to me and then I will get

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
really close to me and then I will get
the<00:03:21.540> jump<00:03:21.810> up<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.170> them<00:03:22.320> because<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.650> canceled

the jump up on them because the canceled
for<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.430> gun<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.760> pretty<00:03:24.420> good<00:03:24.630> I'm<00:03:24.840> like

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
for this gun is pretty good I'm like

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110 
for this gun is pretty good I'm like
last<00:03:25.440> week's<00:03:25.740> chainsaw<00:03:26.190> episode<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.940> don't

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
last week's chainsaw episode you don't

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.730 
last week's chainsaw episode you don't
have<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.450> sit<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.660> cover<00:03:27.990> why<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.290> reload

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
have to sit and cover why you reload

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.840 
have to sit and cover why you reload
this<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> those<00:03:29.310> guns<00:03:29.520> where<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.730> can

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
this is one of those guns where you can

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.760 
this is one of those guns where you can
run<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> gun<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.930> should<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.410> an<00:03:31.500> AR

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
run a gun as you should be with an AR

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.100 
run a gun as you should be with an AR
and<00:03:31.920> SMG<00:03:32.490> now<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.150> recoil<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.840> gun

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
and SMG now for the recoil of this gun

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.170 
and SMG now for the recoil of this gun
is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.410> third<00:03:34.650> best<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.190> all<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.550> ARS<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is the third best of all the ARS that is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.880 
is the third best of all the ARS that is
comfortable<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.870> easy<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.080> control<00:03:37.410> it's

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
comfortable and easy to control it's

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.860 
comfortable and easy to control it's
classified<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> low<00:03:38.910> recoil<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.570> grip

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
classified as a low recoil and grip

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.540 
classified as a low recoil and grip
allows<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.320> become<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> very<00:03:40.950> low<00:03:41.220> recoil

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
allows it to become a very low recoil

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.580 
allows it to become a very low recoil
rate<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.480> improves<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.960> accuracy<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
rate this improves the accuracy and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.620 
rate this improves the accuracy and
dependability<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.520> gun<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.390> grip

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
dependability of the gun and with grip

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.720 
dependability of the gun and with grip
it<00:03:45.810> becomes<00:03:46.260> one<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.710> my<00:03:46.860> favorite<00:03:47.310> guns<00:03:47.550> to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
it becomes one of my favorite guns to

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.490 
it becomes one of my favorite guns to
use<00:03:47.970> granted<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.630> all<00:03:48.780> preference<00:03:49.320> at

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
use granted that is all preference at

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.860 
use granted that is all preference at
that<00:03:49.680> point<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.520> gives<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.180> little<00:03:51.210> recoil

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
that point but it gives so little recoil

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.260 
that point but it gives so little recoil
off<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.860> fire<00:03:53.220> long-range<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:54.030> not

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
off that I can fire long-range and not

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.720 
off that I can fire long-range and not
have<00:03:54.480> anything<00:03:54.840> really<00:03:55.590> sway<00:03:56.010> my<00:03:56.190> aim<00:03:56.400> at<00:03:56.550> all

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
have anything really sway my aim at all

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.820 
have anything really sway my aim at all
and<00:03:56.940> finally<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.510> 80s<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.140> standard<00:03:58.590> time

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
and finally the 80s is a standard time

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.550 
and finally the 80s is a standard time
for<00:03:59.070> ARS<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.640> 0.3<00:04:00.630> seconds<00:04:01.050> now<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.350> things

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
for ARS is 0.3 seconds now the things

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.900 
for ARS is 0.3 seconds now the things
that<00:04:01.710> I<00:04:01.770> would<00:04:01.890> run<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.370> gun<00:04:02.520> with<00:04:02.670> any

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that I would run on this gun with any

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.220 
that I would run on this gun with any
class<00:04:03.210> setup<00:04:03.570> would<00:04:03.780> definitely<00:04:04.140> be

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
class setup would definitely be

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.110 
class setup would definitely be
scavenger<00:04:04.740> or<00:04:04.770> fully<00:04:05.190> loaded<00:04:05.460> simply<00:04:06.030> because

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
scavenger or fully loaded simply because

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.940 
scavenger or fully loaded simply because
you<00:04:06.270> run<00:04:06.540> out<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.690> ammo<00:04:07.050> very<00:04:07.410> quickly<00:04:07.710> with

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
you run out of ammo very quickly with

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.010 
you run out of ammo very quickly with
this<00:04:08.070> gun<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.820> burn<00:04:09.060> through<00:04:09.300> mo<00:04:09.600> like<00:04:09.840> it's

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
this gun you burn through mo like it's

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.200 
this gun you burn through mo like it's
nothing<00:04:10.230> definitely<00:04:11.220> run<00:04:11.370> an<00:04:11.490> optic<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.970> some

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
nothing definitely run an optic of some

nothing definitely run an optic of some
sort<00:04:12.510> iron<00:04:12.930> sights<00:04:13.350> are<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.770> dodgy<00:04:14.010> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
sort iron sights are little dodgy and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.830 
sort iron sights are little dodgy and
aren't<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.640> best<00:04:14.910> at<00:04:15.150> least<00:04:15.420> in<00:04:15.570> my<00:04:15.720> opinion

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
aren't the best at least in my opinion

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.930 
aren't the best at least in my opinion
they<00:04:16.230> can<00:04:16.380> still<00:04:16.620> be<00:04:16.739> used<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.520> most

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
they can still be used for most

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.270 
they can still be used for most
situations<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.960> would<00:04:19.170> most<00:04:19.410> rather<00:04:19.739> have

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
situations but I would most rather have

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.130 
situations but I would most rather have
a<00:04:20.310> red<00:04:20.640> dot<00:04:20.850> sight<00:04:21.150> or<00:04:21.390> something<00:04:21.780> else<00:04:21.930> maybe

very little recoil but whenever you run
grip<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.560> recoil<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.160> almost<00:05:05.430> non-existent

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
grip the recoil is almost non-existent

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.060 
grip the recoil is almost non-existent
and<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.630> doesn't<00:05:07.140> take<00:05:07.320> away<00:05:07.440> from<00:05:07.590> any<00:05:07.920> year
