00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 ours why we have approached 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.379
 to sergio to the cndh to teach us 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 how purity is sought in the bull 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.219
 horse as he trains because if he 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.519
 train from the classroom also to fight 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.519
 horse 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.350
 there is one of the things that I think is what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.110
 harder than it is to have righteousness the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.530
 righteousness of anger in this case the bull does not 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.450
 because normally 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.760
 the cable is afraid they are afraid of 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 bull and the easiest the most normal thing is that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 the horse that was as soon as possible to leave 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.760
 from there 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
 and then get out as round as possible 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.350
 the luck to be able to enter the other python to 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.320
 opposite python to cross with the bull 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.520
 and then get out of there the most giving in case 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.700
 the most giving that is because the horse 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.350
 table face leave your back and remove the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.420
 rump your body to dodge the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.100
 lathe or how to hook it by the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.470
 breasts and empty it by the rump as a 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.449
 muletazo not the skin or good can you 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.979
 start from depending does not depend on the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.860
 bull that you have has one more bull 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.420
 soon you can have more distance 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.890
 depending on horses there is also no 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.020
 horses that see it lighter catching 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.180
 more distance when less more in short 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.300
 depending as soon as the bull is 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.979
 then it took the site this in front of 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.840
 a tad ahead of the stirrup 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.340
 depending a little bit also on each 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.860
 bull there are no bulls waiting for more than 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.869
 bulls you expect less but but what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.369
 ideal is to see him receive here not and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.369
 hook it up a tad ahead 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.610
 of the stirrup for its side and then it's re 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.149
 where around the python right by 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.149
 one is nailed 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.500
 The brave bull is an animal that deserves 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.480
 maximum respect when you get angry fight 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.100
 very seriously fight really fight to 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.100
 death like those bulls in the hill
