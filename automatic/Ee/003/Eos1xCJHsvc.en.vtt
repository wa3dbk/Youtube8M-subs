00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 felix felix agencies get a hat 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.530
 the beautiful and ugly so far but 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530
 neither 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.080
 the ultimate tetris appears petris 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 ultimate what a creative lama the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.710
 Classic among the puzzles has 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 suitable for the thirtieth birthday 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 get makeover and be with tetris 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 then on pc and the next gen consoles 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 playstation 4 and xbox from appear 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.950
 probably because of the insane 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.809
 High graphic requirements were 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 otherwise I just get so fulfilled I get 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.960
 my elaborate graphics 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.149
 would have to be neatly detailed 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.440
 be and run at 60 fps on the fifth 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.390
 you still miss something in this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 is an incredibly detailed playing field 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.219
 not enough appreciated that would be fatal 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 so sarcasm mode now on the new 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.059
 Tetris contains a battle mode with 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.379
 different ones and if you like 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.879
 a lot of points at once accumulated in 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.980
 We'll get rid of as many stones as possible 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.039
 there are punishment-free for your opponents 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.439
 that war is still a new old game 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.110
 what friendship destroys there is yes 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.820
 already more than 50 different turns 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.140
 Tetris also does not talk but we are 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 but still curious what the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.750
 developer for the latest solution 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.280
 they thought they had one, too 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 new stone combination found 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 Come on, imagine who you are 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.330
 Favorite citrus stone you are a type 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 like cliff or if you prefer 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.909
 long and thin 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.370
 the battery that has seen the nerd check 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.170
 he knows more 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.030
 Do you know this when you are 13 years old 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.400
 whose films have watched and wanted that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.410
 stop this damn comic again 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.560
 singing in the fucking blog on 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.390
 go such internal with 18 to 22 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.980
 with her best friend under one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.980
 ceiling under the ceiling 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.440
 and then all the movies come as 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.240
 Realverfilmungen snow white and the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.830
 huntsman is refreshing right now 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 Come out with hot water if you like 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.850

 the beautiful and the double 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 By the way, with two means 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.020
 times 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.480
 We are a separate Disney writing 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.700
 get the twilight director and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.500
 script author of hercules so not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.110
 hot drawn dissens hercules 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 but from the upcoming version with 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.610

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.930
 watson little spoiler do not see that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.880
 By the way, you can give us biggs as peace 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.489
 were so good came introduced 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.380
 The running pine from dance on energy 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 which version you can find better 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.260
 the two-ply or the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.590
 Let's go on for the fans among you 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.140
 Oh yes, if you are already 18 and not 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.390
 How often perry or tiff is google test 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.060
 or just let it horsemen per day 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.099
 when he is calculating because he is a horse 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.290
 is a 600 kilo entertainer 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.430
 from the 90s and could camp afterwards 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.469
 do not land behind 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.849
 and now we're following him in the series 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.560
 20 years later like his life like that 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.969
 looks like the American animated 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.739
 series is first on netflix 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.079
 But certainly comes through the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.319
 wafting waves of the internet on everyone 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.269
 Eventually, hopefully, to us too 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.829
 not or yet gauck has a pretty 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.970
 Rough dry number and the 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.579
 the series just swell 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.799
 has appeared is really good to me 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.189
 that was the worst place i have 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.599
 heard something she had asked for 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.200
 that also pretty cool in English 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.419
 original 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.700
 this is recommended because of the gags 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.819
 among other things apple wants arnett 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.250
 and msc as her always pass well or 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.930
 So you have seen badly in English 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.659
 describes what she snow white and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.879
 So you can be the sister of Jack 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.889
 series starts on 22 august and will be 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.949
 in our opinion be very cool 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.209
 even if animation is style and humor 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.579
 own but are like the construction 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.139
 give it to you like the trailer 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.680
 which is the show with the bassist 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:14.479
 under the waistline in japan already 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.479
 said so I type in the house roof 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.490
 gp enough now from humans animals 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.150
 We stay with series and that starts 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.910
 already on 2 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.800
 june the new series lottery on the us 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.930
 transmitter lifetime diplomatic is very 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.000
 gloomy for five years will not be a girl 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.590
 more pregnant children stay out 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.510
 and you do not know why yet 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.240
 Scientists now succeed depending on 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.040
 113 fertilize them and how to deal with 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.520
 bypasses this , the series brings her on 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.380
 1 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.300
 that's because a lottery is supposed to be 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.580
 Which woman is pregnant 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.350
 may be you is that would be 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.850
 five years ago no screaming happens 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.980
 Babies are not unwanted 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.260
 no adult pregnancies 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.750
 Company 22 o'clock sunning at any time of the day 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.400
 yes okay the negative point would be 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.980
 maybe the extinction of ours 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.810
 complete breed but sometimes you have to 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.940
 a victim will definitely bring in one 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.890
 blatant topic what a lot of leeway for 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.630
 speculation offers how do you see that 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.380
 what would happen if we were five years old 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.260
 no longer produce babies 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.600
 you would get would find such a 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.890
 lottery morally defensible or must 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.800
 you just take what you can get 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.150
 writes the times 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:31.720
 That was the day of Karibuni tÃ¤ters and Emma 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:38.349
 watson the masses as another series 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:42.490
 with the subject sodomie that we spin 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:45.129
 time anyway, we report for 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.020
 more here 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:52.210
 but only next time because we 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:06:00.969
 go back home now and here 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:00.969
 not the word extra text 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.970
 pavatex can 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.090
 subscribed to and they have a felix
