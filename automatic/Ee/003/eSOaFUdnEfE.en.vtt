00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.760 

I<00:01:03.550> thought<00:01:04.330> of<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.570> winter<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.320> traffic

and<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.340> time<00:01:06.610> spent<00:01:07.000> moving<00:01:07.210> about<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:07.960> I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
and the time spent moving about and I

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:26.420 
and the time spent moving about and I
wondered<00:01:08.740> why<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.010> was<00:01:09.340> necessary<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:10.170> 1955

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

well we think we got used to it but by
the<00:02:36.209> end<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> term<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.170> find<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.769> the
