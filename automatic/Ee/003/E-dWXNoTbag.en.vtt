00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 peter sagan particularity greets them 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 couriers I hope you took advantage of the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 nice weather this weekend on this app is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.120
 today we will represent for the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.190
 first time a saddle 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.800
 it is the only one that has the most success 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.770
 from the pro logo range it's neither more nor 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.680
 less than the scratch presented here in 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.280
 its version rhayti rocks and technologies 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.270
 then cpc among the stars who rolls on 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.260
 the scratch 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.030
 we are waiting for twin brother Simon Peter Peter 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.160
 sagan but peter sagan I would like 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.680
 Ben rode well as listening it happens 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 maybe one day waiting for you go 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.790
 begin by explaining to us what is it 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.430
 the first characteristic of the dola 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.230
 scratch ok so big peculiarity 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 it's the shape of the one we have to do 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.720
 a round scene on its back part and 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.150
 on the flat of the stage the invs into account 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.880
 the round saddles are the scenes the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.940
 more comfortable especially for 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.100
 pilots who are a little bit relieved at 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.510
 high level their position at 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.080
 position level here a little bit 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.750
 more raised and his pro logo adds the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 active system in city 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.860
 it's a technology that you have a 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 variable density at the level of 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.730
 stuffing the scene the more you go 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.760
 forward of the stage plus the saddle 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.530
 and unctuous the big advantage that there is 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.510
 to have is that the more we reduce the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.700
 smoother support surface so you 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.980
 are going to have the same comfort whatever 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.560
 your position on the saddle and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.300
 especially this is the number one asset of the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.660
 scratch when you're in the bottom of 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.550
 scene ie 80% of the time you 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.890
 are going to have the perineum which is the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.710
 first source of discomfort on a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.960
 bike saddle the perineum is going to be in the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.310
 soft part of the saddle and we're going 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.910
 halve the pressure at the level 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 perineum 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.110
 what is really the secret of the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.959
 scratch here like I told you everything to 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.340
 the time we have the version cpc the cpc it's 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.739
 a technology that is only used 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.480
 by pronovost that will have two advantages 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.590
 so these are the little ones 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.810
 black squares here on the stage the two 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.870
 characteristics of the cpc it's going first the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.080
 grip is then the cpc acted like a 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.209
 anti vibration so just sees 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.459
 bring even more comfort to the ace 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.650
 crash you otherwise you use the cpc 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.980
 for a year then not on the scratch 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.959
 on the x 0 I believe but what is 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.629
 what do you like in the cpc 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.519
 what does it bring you samoa le cpc 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.310
 it's really something that I love 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.939
 I love a lot I compare it to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.319
 a peace no less than the improvement that 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.579
 provides the automatic pedal 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.680
 there the cpc yeah exactly the cpc when 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.719
 we're sitting on the saddle we're really 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.790
 blocked once one has chosen his 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.040
 position we do not slip any more 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.719
 when we are going to make a salt beak a 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.969
 big bump and a big radar 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.960
 once we are really settled we will 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.760
 publishes so this is really improving 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.050
 the output the power that we are going 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.940
 give because we focus 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.130
 only on his pedaling actually in 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.770
 general on a saddle we always talk 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.450
 comfort there with the cpc we go 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.800
 flatly talked about improving the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.160
 performance of acts boring me the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.930
 performance that speaks okay so and 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.670
 the anti-vibration part august and one 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.950
 little less vibration also 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.370
 killed increases the comfort of the room 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 So here to remember the scratch 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.110
 firstly its shape the round form that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.910
 is the most comfortable form on the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.650
 market at the scenes Latif 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
 density that will allow you to 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.990
 relieve the pressure at the level of 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.290
 perineum and cpc therefore anti vibrations 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.830
 and especially the grip that will cancel all 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.410
 the residual movements and so you 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.600
 help improve your performance 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.490
 you also need to know that the scratch 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.530
 exists in several versions here it's 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.350
 the top with the version cpc it exists 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.640
 also with a carbon rail but on the 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.970
 scratch we will also have versions 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.020
 more classic without the cpc from 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.790
 99 euros 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.220
 all these versions will be you 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.060
 presented in future video / south ap 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.650
 soft is soon see you soon peter for 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.650
 a new video are going to practice
