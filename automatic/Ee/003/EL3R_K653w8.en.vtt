00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.889
 the first year of the poliarte lo 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.240
 he attends and without even an absence 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.240
 despite the snow 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.970
 despite the rains I discovered 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.240
 so by chance or via the web site of the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 poliarte I have been two open days and da 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 there I had already decided this is what 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.560
 i want to make word of what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.560
 I want to do design 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.309
 the thesis apulia appears as a 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.590
 family environment and you can create 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.260
 a personal relationship with the professors 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.149
 right now I'm working on it 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.510
 mainly 3D rendering graphics 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.760
 for catalogs up to animation for 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.659
 video effects films post effects effects 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.790
 special at the same time continue to 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.830
 propose myself as an industrial designer either 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.250
 for personal projects than for 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.490
 companies 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.170
 this continuous continuous experimentation 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:21.399
 approaching new things 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:25.070
 led me to really want then 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.810
 I took care of fashion shows 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.729
 photograph of anything that you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.979
 he could pass under marlowe now 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.539
 I look with a much more critical eye 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.570
 much more curious all that there is 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.570
 surrounds
