00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.970
 pocket studio in the continuity of the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.040
 video two weeks ago today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.990
 I decided to twist an idea 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.990
 received who obviously has a hard tooth 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 so today I'm going to do a little 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.350
 hardware test 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:28.619
 I'm going to compare a 18-55mm mounted on 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:33.450
 a boat 1100 ba1 24 mm f / 1 4 mounted 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.730
 on 1.5 marks 3 then attach your 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.430
 belts 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.579
 today it's the rubin that is the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.579
 chief 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.700
 you have been several to notice 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.730
 in my latest publications of my 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.460
 latest videos yes I bought 1.5 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.020
 I had already mentioned this 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.530
 buy in a video questions answers 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.140
 there is already some time so it's bah 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 it's not really a novelty the psc 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.160
 that's fine but I have to say that for 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.110
 ladle started to really feel 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.060
 limited to be able to move forward provide a 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.400
 technically superior work and then 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 justify a progression of contempt good 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.770
 bah I had to change 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.149
 so I typed in the money earned 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.070
 so far and for the first time 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.220
 since my last film 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.490
 there I went back to full size 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.200
 so it's great gear that makes me 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 feel a bit like the ribbon 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.110
 I am aware of having in my hands 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.420
 material that many will not stop 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.950
 never but for all that I will not be 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.690
 never someone is equipped with a small 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.160
 device that me because the first 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
 thing that I could see with the 5d 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.080
 mark iii is that he does not make me 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.570
 a better photographer I do not care about the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.729
 mouth of this gala since enough 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 long time not to have to become 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.140
 like him so today I'm going to you 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.729
 show once and for all that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.410
 the camera does not make the photographer and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.970
 that the 5d mark iii does not make good 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.649
 pics 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.179
 the 5d mark iii does not make good 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.630
 pics 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.069
 the photographer makes good pictures 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.680
 so for the purposes of my experience 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.300
 I appealed to lo誰c a guy that those 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.060
 who smiles on my channel has already previewed 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.030
 lo誰c is a good friend and he was perfect 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.970
 for this experience because lo誰c 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.550
 is not a photographer and he is not 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 to fuck the photo a quality that is 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.020
 rare nowadays 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.700
 so I gave him my 5 starts 300 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.430
 more instructions and I asked him 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.620
 to make me two pictures a portrait and 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
 a landscape all in perfect 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.550
 improvisation and me just after to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 not influence it 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.069
 I took the same subjects in photo with 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.170
 the 1100d and the 18-55 so first the 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.849
 landscape did not speak well we took in 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.260
 photo the field in front of my home there 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.160
 was not particularly good so 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.580
 it was perfectly fine 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.580
 experience 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.610
 then I asked him to do a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.319
 portrait of me inside next 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.620
 of a window then I did the same 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.110
 thing with him the difference between these 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.030
 photos is shouting not from the point of view 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.970
 technological but from the point of view 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.510
 technical framing composition light 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.290
 etc. 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 that's what's changing as good as it is 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.379
 the 5d mark iii 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.879
 lo誰c does not know how to use it 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.159
 so the same pictures as the one that 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.040
 would have done with his phone month 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.019
 unpretentious no I know how to make 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.519
 pictures i know how to adjust my 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.709
 device I know the rules of 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.359
 composition of frame of sight short I 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.060
 am able to exploit a situation 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.889
 by moving or moving the subject 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.930
 framing only the details 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.989
 interesting or playing on the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.609
 good depth of field these two pictures 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.000
 I recognize it are still not the 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.849
 pictures of the century but if you do not know 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.639
 not all to buy a better device 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.349
 photo will not change your photos put a 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.030
 full format a medium format or 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.730
 any device overpriced or 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.459
 even a simple reflex if you do not 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.319
 never had use before will not change 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.530
 your photos what will that change on a 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.599
 good device know the noise the dynamics 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.579
 contrasts colors a good 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.769
 goal will change your sting your 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.699
 depth of field but that's it and 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.579
 as much to say it directly know nothing 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.370
 these elements play up to 5% in 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.750
 the quality of a photo the other 95% 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.199
 are the framing of the light the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.639
 composition is the most important 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.909
 history and emotion gives the photo 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.280
 and that's not brought by a good 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.960
 device less good goals that's it 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.710
 bring by you 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.790
 the photographer 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.440
 I remind you that all the great 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.640
 photos of the great photographers of the century 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.800
 last were made with 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.050
 devices that you denigrate yaisian 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.500
 today and even out beyond 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.510
 material if this kind of pictures was 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.290
 made by a stranger is subject to a 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.260
 critical group 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.140
 I greet all the members of the 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.720
 group f 1.4 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.610
 she would be made to put her foot off 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.650
 the girl on the left also 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.170
 the horizon is not right the rule of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.880
 third is not respected but in the end we 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.680
 the main interest of 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 this photo for example is the emotion 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.830
 that he releases and sometimes on the spot 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.400
 garage did what so do not you 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.280
 never ever be snubbed by a guy 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.140
 better equipped and more money 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.480
 all the better for him but that does not mean in 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.590
 no case say he has more talent if 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.130
 one day someone oussenov because he 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.510
 has a bigger one 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.550
 she tells him that the camera 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.240
 it's like the bistroquet no it's not 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.790
 the size that matters 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.270
 and if he insists on asking him if he has 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.680
 a rolex 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.600
 such that it's just the rubin that 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.940
 rises year 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.710
 today I compared two devices 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.740
 photo in the price difference is from 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.090
 order of a factor 10 but you have 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.700
 noticed that the most important in 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.320
 the story was not the camera 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.800
 it was a photographer etc as good 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.760
 the 5d mark iii 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.370
 if it's put in the hands of an amateur 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.790
 who knows nothing about it he will not do 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.400
 good photos 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.610
 and a contrario if you are an amateur 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.860
 enlightened or even a professional a little 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.210
 does it matter that you like the photo and that 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.060
 you have an input device of 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.770
 range that does not prevent you in any case from 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.840
 make good pictures 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.130
 so yes I bought 1.5 starts 3 and 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.060
 to be honest the second half 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.920
 full format is planned for the year 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.270
 next but I will continue to do 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.009
 practical tutorials with little 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.240
 equipment 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.919
 because I know that not everyone has 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 not the same budget and you're here 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.729
 to learn not to watch the 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.039
 others do for you I salute and 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.169
 thanks adrien guillaume jimmy to lille 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.580
 uc pierre fran巽ois and cindy to have 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.469
 took part in the deception when I 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.169
 submitted the photo of cartier-bresson to the 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:44.029
 critical and and i also greet blandine 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.099
 the moderator of the group f 1.4 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.960
 many of you ask me to 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.270
 criticize your photos much too much 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.559
 many and unfortunately I have not 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.719
 always have time to do it 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:56.059
 so if you want a critique 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:57.559
 constructive of your work I you 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:00.409
 invite to join facebook group of 

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:01.430
 s辿bastien royan the group f 1,4 or you 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.279
 can submit your photos to the 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.740
 critical but careful they are without 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.059
 pity 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.589
 I also take the opportunity to thank all 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:11.210
 participants the evening dedicated to the 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.770
 circular of May 24 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.819
 it went really well in 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.949
 besides results more than 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.419
 correct considering the flat of the 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.580
 evening ie the arrival of the clouds 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.990
 one who forced us to scroll 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.839
 a little shorter than expected 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.639
 we were a good twenty if my 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:29.180
 memories are good the atmosphere was 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.110
 so I'm going to put it back I know 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.149
 not yet when but I'm going to 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.499
 put back and that's not excluded either 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:35.569
 that I explore that the concept elsewhere in 

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.219
 France according to my movements 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.789
 I 'll talk about it again when I have some 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.789
 concrete thing
