00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
well there are a few early things that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.570 
well there are a few early things that
we're<00:00:19.640> done<00:00:19.790> before<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:20.210> met<00:00:20.450> why<00:00:20.780> I<00:00:20.810> met<00:00:21.170> Ryan

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
we're done before I met why I met Ryan

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.910 
we're done before I met why I met Ryan
1964<00:00:22.580> but<00:00:23.950> it's<00:00:25.060> really<00:00:26.060> like<00:00:26.270> going<00:00:26.480> through

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
1964 but it's really like going through

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.310 
1964 but it's really like going through
our<00:00:27.920> life<00:00:28.220> together<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:29.119> look<00:00:29.630> at<00:00:29.779> things<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.170> I

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
our life together I look at things and I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.970 
our life together I look at things and I
think<00:00:30.800> it's<00:00:31.100> amazing<00:00:31.369> how<00:00:32.980> contemporary

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
think it's amazing how contemporary

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.450 
think it's amazing how contemporary
things<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.180> look<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.540> me<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.900> mean<00:00:36.170> me<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.340> many

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
things to look to me I mean me so many

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.430 
things to look to me I mean me so many
things<00:00:37.579> look<00:00:38.030> as<00:00:38.180> if<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:38.960> know<00:00:39.050> an<00:00:39.200> artist

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
things look as if a you know an artist

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.069 
things look as if a you know an artist
could<00:00:39.620> be<00:00:39.740> doing<00:00:39.980> them<00:00:40.190> today<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:41.300> mean<00:00:41.720> you

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
could be doing them today I mean you

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.930 
could be doing them today I mean you
know<00:00:42.710> they're<00:00:43.690> fresh<00:00:44.690> they're<00:00:45.680> bright<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
know they're fresh they're bright and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.740 
know they're fresh they're bright and
they<00:00:47.899> look<00:00:48.199> of<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.039> moment<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.760> me<00:00:49.940> he<00:00:50.510> worked

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
they look of the moment to me he worked

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.630 
they look of the moment to me he worked
very<00:00:50.870> hard<00:00:51.109> to<00:00:53.199> transcend<00:00:54.199> say<00:00:54.859> atomic<00:00:55.309> image

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
very hard to transcend say atomic image

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.990 
very hard to transcend say atomic image
and<00:00:55.969> make<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.899> into<00:00:57.489> something<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.820> really

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
and make it into something that really

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.419 
and make it into something that really
worked<00:00:59.300> as<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.539> formal<00:01:00.050> painting<00:01:00.649> I<00:01:00.980> think<00:01:01.340> he

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
worked as a formal painting I think he

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.250 
worked as a formal painting I think he
also<00:01:01.579> wanted<00:01:02.120> them<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.539> realize<00:01:02.899> what<00:01:03.230> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
also wanted them to realize what a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.330 
also wanted them to realize what a
bizarre<00:01:03.500> idea<00:01:03.710> was<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:05.020> freeze<00:01:06.340> something

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
bizarre idea was to freeze something

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.250 
bizarre idea was to freeze something
that<00:01:07.610> was<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:07.850> fluid<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.780> paint<00:01:09.020> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
that was so fluid and to paint a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.620 
that was so fluid and to paint a
brushstroke<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.220> there<00:01:10.940> was<00:01:11.060> certain<00:01:11.480> iron

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
brushstroke so there was certain iron

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.010 
brushstroke so there was certain iron
irony<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.380> he<00:01:12.710> really<00:01:13.570> hoped<00:01:14.570> people<00:01:14.810> would

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
irony that he really hoped people would

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.580 
irony that he really hoped people would
get<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:16.460> range<00:01:16.730> of<00:01:17.240> his<00:01:17.900> subject<00:01:18.590> matter<00:01:18.939> is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
get the range of his subject matter is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.859 
get the range of his subject matter is
extraordinarily<00:01:21.610> pop<00:01:22.610> got<00:01:23.390> everyone's

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
extraordinarily pop got everyone's

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.280 
extraordinarily pop got everyone's
attention<00:01:24.259> because<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.100> looked<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.930> non<00:01:26.930> art

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
attention because it looked so non art

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.740 
attention because it looked so non art
like<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.950> mean<00:01:28.250> even<00:01:28.549> Roy<00:01:28.790> said<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.479> when<00:01:29.630> he

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
like I mean even Roy said that when he

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.710 
like I mean even Roy said that when he
did<00:01:29.930> his<00:01:30.079> first<00:01:30.140> cartoon<00:01:30.920> painting<00:01:31.579> he<00:01:32.420> had<00:01:32.600> to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
did his first cartoon painting he had to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.460 
did his first cartoon painting he had to
get<00:01:32.899> beyond<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.590> level<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.220> his<00:01:35.060> own<00:01:35.470> style

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
get beyond the level of his own style

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.999 
get beyond the level of his own style
and<00:01:36.890> sense<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.579> what<00:01:37.880> art<00:01:38.180> was<00:01:38.299> because<00:01:39.140> it

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
and sense of what art was because it

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.109 
and sense of what art was because it
simply<00:01:40.729> didn't<00:01:41.030> look<00:01:41.119> like<00:01:41.329> art<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:42.259> really

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
simply didn't look like art I really

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.620 
simply didn't look like art I really
love

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
love

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.190 
love
Roy's<00:01:45.409> word<00:01:45.909> they<00:01:46.909> clearly<00:01:47.299> work<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.990> two

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
Roy's word they clearly work on two

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.700 
Roy's word they clearly work on two
levels<00:01:48.469> so<00:01:49.219> they<00:01:49.399> tend<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> be<00:01:49.759> more<00:01:50.030> abstract

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
levels so they tend to be more abstract

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.039 
levels so they tend to be more abstract
like<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.920> mirrors<00:01:52.750> representation<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.960> a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
like the mirrors representation of a

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.789 
like the mirrors representation of a
mirror<00:01:54.350> in<00:01:54.860> an<00:01:55.450> advertisement<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.350> really

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
mirror in an advertisement is it really

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.429 
mirror in an advertisement is it really
a<00:01:57.829> complete<00:01:58.219> abstraction<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.689> I<00:01:59.869> hope<00:02:00.110> that

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
a complete abstraction and I hope that

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.260 
a complete abstraction and I hope that
when<00:02:00.590> people<00:02:00.619> come<00:02:01.070> through<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.520> exhibition

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
when people come through the exhibition

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.709 
when people come through the exhibition
they<00:02:03.079> will<00:02:03.759> really<00:02:04.759> realize<00:02:05.030> how<00:02:05.060> expansive

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
they will really realize how expansive

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:15.450 
they will really realize how expansive
his<00:02:06.380> range<00:02:06.710> was

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.760 

this<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.820> first<00:02:17.120> retrospective<00:02:17.780> census

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
this is the first retrospective census

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.600 
this is the first retrospective census
death<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.300> he<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.890> part<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.280> history

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
death so he is really part of history

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.270 
death so he is really part of history
now<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:23.000> another<00:02:23.210> way<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:26.060> also<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.750> show

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
now in another way and we also can show

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.090 
now in another way and we also can show
some<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.430> his<00:02:28.460> very<00:02:29.060> late<00:02:29.360> work<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.680> people

some of his very late work that people

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.150 
some of his very late work that people
don't<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.880> well<00:02:32.680> look<00:02:33.680> at<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.040> the
