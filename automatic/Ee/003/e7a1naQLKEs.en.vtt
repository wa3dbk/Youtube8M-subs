00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.900
 in a hurry we're just here in Heidelberg at the castle and percent 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.819
 the sun then beats difficult light situations 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.339
 and now I want to capture this scenario what you see here 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.339
 the Marburger Bund 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.319
 now he is when he and looking up 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:28.839
 Radisson Maze extreme and it is difficult light situations 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.189
 and around 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.120
 occupied aon kidswear yes Anzinger what will do here now is not against 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.020
 10 min Jeong we do not do row 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 Now many people certainly do not think that I have a tripod 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.420
 that Baumann but without stupid catfish, among other their pictures in 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.949
 Followed with this exposure correction 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.299
 that you are nevertheless able to loosely manage to take over life 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.809
 he had barely calculated 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.880
 and I go in my life 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.920
 Mister Zoom as a measure to turn it off 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.990
 and then he sees here al-ahmar acting exposure compensation 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.400
 Now, of course, depending on the camera model depending on each set and here 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.480
 little now but likes how many blinds to plus 1 - I want to go 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.420
 m Depending on how difficult light situations are, lock is very important 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.400
 with a little more than just Blender 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.040
 confirm the whole 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.580
 and then a show I still that stupid up here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.770
 in any case so that's a picture episode is as Ines 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 Shooting 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.670
 Jana only struck 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.530
 Jahn's firm point of view, where it is absolutely necessary to have the students quickly 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.480
 in the too blurry disgrace that time 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.180
 just an exception by holding 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.140
 the house remains on the trigger and to make several exception 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.820
 Now I have too fast a shot 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.630
 a witness recording and a correctly exposed shot 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.670
 and about who if now almost to shoulders 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.179
 brought together to a reception or persons 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.509
