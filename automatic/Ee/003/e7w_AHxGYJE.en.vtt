00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 a romantic drama with a light touch 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 fantasy impact awaits that beginning 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 July in german cinemas 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:18.199
 and that's about forever 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:18.199
 In Bonn alone lived a normal life 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.619
 until a cold winter night in the year 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.619
 1935 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.890
 as something incredible 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.840
 from that moment on she never became 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.840
 Parents do not have a single day 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.950
 I always stay your mother and you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 always stay my daughter as a live man 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.700
 do not you know anybody about it? 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.230
 to take 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.790
 the same if you are not old together 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.470
 can be 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.530
 without that, love breaks that only 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:59.030
 that's one 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.590
 how is that possible 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.980
 they look just like an old one 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.620
 Friend of mine confessed and very close 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.909
 I know almost nothing done, it is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.060
 better this way 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.159
 no it is not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 all these years you have been in the world 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.680
 and did not really hate I know 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.680
 not how 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.440
 tell me something that can hold on 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.440
 and I will not let it go 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.370
 company noble offer and 13 minutes from 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.430
 six years released and starts 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.260
 9 july 2015 in German cinemas 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.660
 and tells the story of a noble 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.670
 a young woman actually booming 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.260
 could lead a happy life 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.080
 born at the beginning of the twentieth 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.150
 but in 1933, she suffers 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.710
 an accident and because of the consequences of 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.200
 accident she does not age her anymore 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.430
 stay forever 29 years old and that 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.960
 problem that if you do not like age 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.940
 you realize that the people around 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.950
 that means for them that they swear 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.360
 needs to move regularly so nobody 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.100
 she recognizes nobody behind her again 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.600
 mystery comes because it also means 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520
 who would like to find out what 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.410
 is then with her dna on it because 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.670
 other big institutions have 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.560
 of course, on such quotes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.060
 Almost supernatural yes a whole 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.489
 own interest and that's the way it is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.500
 earth landscape from r10 to decade 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.120
 somehow to survive but never the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.920
 true love can be found because you are 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.450
 not long may bind to human to 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.040
 your own imagination has to come like that 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.720
 to meet it almost always but 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.250
 At some point, she almost hits this one 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 one who does not want to let go 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.250
 in the present time and then learns too 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.709
 still knows his family and then gives 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.660
 It's a huge tobago and I have to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.340
 then say a film is forever noble 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.780
 where you can already see in the trailer trailer 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.620
 What happens there what it is more likely 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.030
 that's the point 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.709
 So the question arises why does 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.989
 he does it well and I have to say it 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.760
 forever noble an incredibly touching 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.989
 yes yes the film is fortunate for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.150
 a romantic for a romantic 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.799
 drama and word of fantasy factor not 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.000
 There is too much in the foreground 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.290
 only as a two moments in the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.880
 The franchise will be used as such 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.350
 a little bit more fantastic are not too 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.730
 clichÃ© overload this movie 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.560
 maybe for many men ticking too 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.329
 cheesy but who likes stripes 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.860
 It has a very high quality 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.209
 Enemy staged artisan well by 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.160
 blake lively as main actress 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.690
 played sweet and, above all, too 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.989
 if a harrison ford occurs after only 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.010
 70 minutes in the movie has so much on 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.299
 presence within the strip that me 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.010
 she found quite impressive rather then 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.630
 honest movies delight i almost had 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.860
 a tear in the cinema is like that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.720
 touching that is nice 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.280
 he is not so intent on turning 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.750
 it's just a movie 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 I have to say where I have to say 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.630
 over 100 and 13 minutes because it is 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.220
 already a certain run length not 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.560
 bored in the cinema and the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.239
 romantic drama forever noble 1 is 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 maybe once have become really nice 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.540
 also the absolute madness is really 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.180
 start well sounding name and should 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.609
 if I mean that we are always noble 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.409
 really really as a romantic drama 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.430
 strong eight and a half out of 10 possible 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.780
 get points 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.189
 Overall, I think he's great too 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.780
 worth seven out of ten possible 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.670
 score points and thus through in my 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.170
 revier to the stripes like that one 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.640
 thumb because if you liked this, let it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.230
 we do not stay that way otherwise 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.700
 There are still a few left and me 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.099
 around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.389
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.639
 I hope here since we do with it 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.639
 of course at 3
