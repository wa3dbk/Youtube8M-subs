00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.900 
hey guys legless man tango to give you
an<00:00:09.920> unboxing<00:00:10.190> of<00:00:10.549> the<00:00:10.610> HP<00:00:11.119> stream<00:00:11.389> 14<00:00:12.340> c001<00:00:13.340> na

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
an unboxing of the HP stream 14 c001 na

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.519 
an unboxing of the HP stream 14 c001 na
so<00:00:14.240> this<00:00:14.389> is<00:00:14.480> actually<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:14.869> refurbished

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
so this is actually the refurbished

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.140 
so this is actually the refurbished
model<00:00:15.859> as<00:00:16.010> you'll<00:00:16.129> see<00:00:16.279> in<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.490> title<00:00:16.670> and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
model as you'll see in the title and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.670 
model as you'll see in the title and
because<00:00:17.660> of<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:17.840> it<00:00:17.960> doesn't<00:00:18.199> actually<00:00:18.289> have

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
because of that it doesn't actually have

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.679 
because of that it doesn't actually have
the<00:00:18.920> original<00:00:19.340> packaging<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.390> of<00:00:20.480> course

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
the original packaging so of course

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.609 
the original packaging so of course
because<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.109> doesn't<00:00:21.349> come<00:00:21.470> with<00:00:21.560> the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
because it doesn't come with the

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.990 
because it doesn't come with the
original<00:00:21.710> packaging<00:00:22.310> it<00:00:22.460> comes<00:00:22.670> with<00:00:22.820> a<00:00:22.850> lot

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
original packaging it comes with a lot

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.510 
original packaging it comes with a lot
less<00:00:23.030> accessories<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.380> also<00:00:24.980> it's<00:00:25.160> just<00:00:25.340> me

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
less accessories and also it's just me

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.220 
less accessories and also it's just me
included<00:00:26.030> with<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.240> safety<00:00:26.690> and<00:00:26.810> regulation

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
included with the safety and regulation

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.680 
included with the safety and regulation
menus<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.070> of<00:00:28.400> course<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:29.029> power<00:00:29.360> brick<00:00:29.570> as

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.660 
menus and of course the power brick as
well<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.560> there<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:30.830> have<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.100> power<00:00:31.369> brick

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
well so there we have the power brick

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.639 
well so there we have the power brick
and<00:00:31.880> once<00:00:32.359> we<00:00:32.480> get<00:00:32.599> that<00:00:32.660> open<00:00:33.050> we<00:00:33.199> can<00:00:33.230> turn

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
and once we get that open we can turn

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.139 
and once we get that open we can turn
boots<00:00:33.829> on<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.129> laptop<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:34.670> first<00:00:34.879> we'll<00:00:35.030> try

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
boots on the laptop but first we'll try

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.939 
boots on the laptop but first we'll try
and<00:00:35.270> see<00:00:35.390> if<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.629> latter<00:00:35.809> alergic<00:00:36.260> recharged

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
and see if the latter alergic recharged

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.619 
and see if the latter alergic recharged
usually<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.640> find<00:00:37.879> instructions<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:38.390> be<00:00:38.479> too

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
usually to find instructions to be too

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.029 
usually to find instructions to be too
complicated<00:00:38.960> but<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:39.559> case<00:00:39.829> the

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
complicated but in this case the

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.439 
complicated but in this case the
instruction<00:00:40.489> actually<00:00:40.609> thought<00:00:40.999> complete

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
instruction actually thought complete

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.180 
instruction actually thought complete
opposite<00:00:41.839> though<00:00:42.140> incredibly<00:00:42.679> basic<00:00:42.829> which

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
opposite though incredibly basic which

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.889 
opposite though incredibly basic which
is<00:00:43.309> nice<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.269> be<00:00:44.359> honest<00:00:44.600> there's<00:00:44.780> just

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
is nice but to be honest there's just

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.360 
is nice but to be honest there's just
not<00:00:45.079> enough<00:00:45.139> information<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.039> wish<00:00:46.219> they

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
not enough information on I wish they

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.889 
not enough information on I wish they
included<00:00:46.789> more<00:00:46.909> so<00:00:47.420> there<00:00:47.569> we<00:00:47.659> have<00:00:47.780> the

well we have the battery presenters so
now<00:01:29.630> let's<00:01:29.840> actually<00:01:29.960> have<00:01:30.230> a<00:01:30.410> go<00:01:30.620> at<00:01:30.860> booting

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
now let's actually have a go at booting

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.520 
now let's actually have a go at booting
the<00:01:31.520> laptop<00:01:32.000> up<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.450> definitely<00:01:33.020> be<00:01:33.080> expecting

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
the laptop up I definitely be expecting

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.870 
the laptop up I definitely be expecting
this<00:01:33.650> laptop<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.160> boot<00:01:34.310> up<00:01:34.430> quite<00:01:34.640> quickly

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
this laptop to boot up quite quickly

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.300 
this laptop to boot up quite quickly
considering<00:01:35.480> as<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.930> first<00:01:36.290> do<00:01:36.470> gigabyte<00:01:36.830> SSD

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
considering as a first do gigabyte SSD

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.430 
considering as a first do gigabyte SSD
now<00:01:37.910> unfortunately<00:01:38.150> SSD<00:01:38.900> is<00:01:39.050> actually<00:01:39.350> the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
now unfortunately SSD is actually the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.110 
now unfortunately SSD is actually the
primary<00:01:39.890> storage<00:01:40.160> for<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.400> laptop<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
primary storage for this laptop and I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.580 
primary storage for this laptop and I
think<00:01:41.360> first<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.780> gigabytes<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.230> just<00:01:42.410> not

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
think first do gigabytes is just not

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.500 
think first do gigabytes is just not
enough<00:01:42.860> because<00:01:43.370> when<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.700> actually<00:01:43.910> finished

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
enough because when I actually finished

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.300 
enough because when I actually finished
booting<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.020> entire<00:01:45.290> thing<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.860> got<00:01:46.010> all<00:01:46.160> of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
booting the entire thing and got all of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.800 
booting the entire thing and got all of
the<00:01:46.370> windows<00:01:46.610> settings<00:01:46.850> installed<00:01:47.510> properly

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the windows settings installed properly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.990 
the windows settings installed properly
I<00:01:48.260> only<00:01:48.680> had<00:01:48.890> about<00:01:49.040> 18<00:01:49.430> Giga<00:01:49.640> bytes<00:01:49.790> left

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I only had about 18 Giga bytes left

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.640 
I only had about 18 Giga bytes left
which<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.330> really<00:01:50.720> annoying<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:51.409> then<00:01:51.530> again

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
which is really annoying but then again

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.410 
which is really annoying but then again
it<00:01:51.860> does<00:01:51.980> come<00:01:52.190> with<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.400> micro<00:01:52.670> SD<00:01:52.730> card<00:01:53.210> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
it does come with a micro SD card and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.700 
it does come with a micro SD card and
that<00:01:53.600> will<00:01:53.690> be<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.930> primary<00:01:54.230> way<00:01:54.500> for

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
that will be the primary way for

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.940 
that will be the primary way for
operating

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
operating

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
operating
now<00:01:56.340> some<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.759> may<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.939> already<00:01:57.180> thinking

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
now some of you may be already thinking

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.139 
now some of you may be already thinking
about<00:01:57.869> upgrading<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.470> SSD<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.369> also<00:02:00.000> they've

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
about upgrading the SSD and also they've

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
about upgrading the SSD and also they've
ran<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> quite<00:02:00.899> frankly<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.439> will<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.799> be

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
ran that quite frankly you will not be

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
ran that quite frankly you will not be
able<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.220> do<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.600> reason<00:02:03.720> for<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
able to do this and the reason for that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
able to do this and the reason for that
is<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.560> actually<00:02:05.040> has<00:02:05.220> two<00:02:05.520> gigabytes<00:02:05.880> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
is it actually has two gigabytes of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.440 
is it actually has two gigabytes of
on-board<00:02:07.080> Brown<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.789> will<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.149> be

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
on-board Brown so that will actually be

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.089 
on-board Brown so that will actually be
soldered<00:02:09.899> physically<00:02:10.410> onto<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> motherboard

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
soldered physically onto the motherboard

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.559 
soldered physically onto the motherboard
and<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.880> able<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.209> taken

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and that will not be able to be taken

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.170 
and that will not be able to be taken
out<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.019> also<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.920> has<00:02:14.160> plus<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.060> by

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
out and also it has plus you can go by

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.220 
out and also it has plus you can go by

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
will not be able to upgrade the storage

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
of course there are other alternatives

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.229 
of course there are other alternatives
like<00:02:29.519> using<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:30.150> USB<00:02:30.750> 3.0<00:02:31.440> external<00:02:32.370> hard<00:02:33.000> drive

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
like using a USB 3.0 external hard drive

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.509 
like using a USB 3.0 external hard drive
or<00:02:33.450> using<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.930> microSD<00:02:34.440> card<00:02:34.739> which<00:02:35.130> will<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.370> my

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
or using a microSD card which will be my

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.160 
or using a microSD card which will be my
personal<00:02:35.910> favorite<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.480> upgrading<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
personal favorite for upgrading the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.960 
personal favorite for upgrading the
storage<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.220> reason<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.549> say<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.910> of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
storage now the reason I say that of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.340 
storage now the reason I say that of
course<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.420> fact<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.810> micro<00:02:40.080> sd<00:02:40.319> card

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
course is the fact that a micro sd card

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.530 
course is the fact that a micro sd card
is<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.069> much<00:02:41.220> lighter<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.670> thinner<00:02:42.000> than<00:02:42.299> an

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
is so much lighter and thinner than an

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.050 
is so much lighter and thinner than an
external<00:02:43.140> hard<00:02:43.350> drive<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.830> also<00:02:44.670> be<00:02:44.819> much

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
external hard drive and also be much

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.880 
external hard drive and also be much
more<00:02:45.209> easy<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.600> use<00:02:45.959> for<00:02:46.200> cameras<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.680> well

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
more easy to use for cameras as well

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.009 
more easy to use for cameras as well
where<00:02:47.459> would<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> hard<00:02:48.269> drive<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.750> actually

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
where would the hard drive you actually

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.199 
where would the hard drive you actually
have<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.170> physically<00:02:49.560> carry<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:49.950> around<00:02:50.209> but

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
have to physically carry it around but

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.670 
have to physically carry it around but
of<00:02:51.269> course<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.690> return<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.410> fact<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
of course in return for the fact that

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.530 
of course in return for the fact that
you<00:02:52.799> can't<00:02:53.010> upgrade<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.459> SSD<00:02:53.940> or<00:02:54.150> through<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
you can't upgrade the SSD or through the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.960 
you can't upgrade the SSD or through the
brand<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.200> get<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:56.190> nice<00:02:56.430> thin<00:02:56.790> design

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
brand you get a really nice thin design

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.570 
brand you get a really nice thin design
and<00:02:57.630> also<00:02:58.170> not<00:02:58.680> only<00:02:58.950> they're<00:02:59.130> really<00:02:59.430> nice

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and also not only they're really nice

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.250 
and also not only they're really nice
that<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.820> thin<00:02:59.970> banners<00:03:00.299> also<00:03:00.630> that's<00:03:01.049> a

that the thin banners also that's a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.170 
that the thin banners also that's a
really<00:03:01.709> good<00:03:01.829> price<00:03:02.130> you'd<00:03:02.760> expect<00:03:03.090> this

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
really good price you'd expect this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.720 
really good price you'd expect this
laptop<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.840> between<00:03:04.140> probably<00:03:04.920> 500<00:03:05.609> and

laptop to be between probably 500 and
600<00:03:06.269> pounds<00:03:06.299> where<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.900> laptop<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.380> actually

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
600 pounds where this laptop is actually

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.640 
600 pounds where this laptop is actually
a<00:03:07.920> hundred<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.609> ninety<00:03:08.940> pounds<00:03:09.350> now<00:03:10.350> because

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
a hundred and ninety pounds now because

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.440 
a hundred and ninety pounds now because
of<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> design<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.609> also<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.000> price<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.329> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
of the design and also the price of this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.060 
of the design and also the price of this
laptop<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.930> wouldn't<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.320> expecting<00:03:13.410> any

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
laptop I wouldn't be expecting any

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.069 
laptop I wouldn't be expecting any
amazing<00:03:14.579> specs<00:03:14.850> from<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.420> that's<00:03:15.989> not

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
amazing specs from this and that's not

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.479 
amazing specs from this and that's not
surprising<00:03:16.230> because<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.859> has<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.040> 2

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
surprising because it has just 2

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.599 
surprising because it has just 2
gigabytes<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.970> RAM<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.530> AMD<00:03:19.530> quad<00:03:19.799> core<00:03:19.829> CPU

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
gigabytes of RAM and AMD quad core CPU

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.039 
gigabytes of RAM and AMD quad core CPU
now<00:03:20.880> some<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.269> maybe<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.750> about<00:03:21.810> that

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
now some of you maybe think about that

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.960 
now some of you maybe think about that
that<00:03:22.200> quad<00:03:22.440> core<00:03:22.650> CPU<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.100> great<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:23.700> quite

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that quad core CPU is great but quite

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.789 
that quad core CPU is great but quite
frankly<00:03:24.299> I'll<00:03:24.660> only<00:03:24.989> be<00:03:25.170> expected<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.769> be

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
frankly I'll only be expected to be

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.920 
frankly I'll only be expected to be
using<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.670> web<00:03:26.880> surfing<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.540> also

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
using this for web surfing and also

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.199 
using this for web surfing and also
basic<00:03:28.350> programs<00:03:28.890> like<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> Microsoft<00:03:29.730> Office

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
basic programs like the Microsoft Office

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.780 
basic programs like the Microsoft Office
so<00:03:31.109> generally<00:03:31.470> Windows<00:03:31.769> 8.1<00:03:31.950> takes<00:03:32.519> quite<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
so generally Windows 8.1 takes quite a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.880 
so generally Windows 8.1 takes quite a
while<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.150> actually<00:03:33.180> boot<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.769> is

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
while to actually boot up and this is

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.800 
while to actually boot up and this is
not<00:03:35.010> surprising<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.180> laptop<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.630> is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
not surprising on this laptop but is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.050 
not surprising on this laptop but is
fairly<00:03:37.079> quick<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.560> also<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.579> soon<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:38.880> got

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
fairly quick and also as soon as I got

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.699 
fairly quick and also as soon as I got
near<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.630> finish<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.230> boot<00:03:40.470> it

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
near to the finish of the boot it

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.289 
near to the finish of the boot it
actually<00:03:41.040> started<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.489> come<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.819> with<00:03:41.940> all<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
actually started to come up with all the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.599 
actually started to come up with all the
HP<00:03:42.569> accessories<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.650> also<00:03:43.889> all<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.220> HP

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
HP accessories and also all of the HP

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.949 
HP accessories and also all of the HP
software<00:03:44.880> that's<00:03:45.209> pre-loaded<00:03:45.810> onto<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.200> SSD

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
software that's pre-loaded onto the SSD

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.960 
software that's pre-loaded onto the SSD
so<00:03:48.959> now<00:03:49.079> what<00:03:49.350> Windows<00:03:49.590> 8.1<00:03:49.799> fully<00:03:50.459> loaded<00:03:50.700> and

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
so now what Windows 8.1 fully loaded and

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.150 
so now what Windows 8.1 fully loaded and
up<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.359> running<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.590> try<00:03:52.889> and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
up and running and now you can try and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.400 
up and running and now you can try and
use<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.970> basic<00:03:54.389> programs<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.200> be

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
use the basic programs that I to be

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.559 
use the basic programs that I to be
expecting<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.069> using<00:03:56.459> quite<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.670> lot<00:03:56.940> from

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
expecting to be using quite a lot from

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.120 
expecting to be using quite a lot from
first<00:03:57.840> impressions<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.350> really<00:03:58.739> makes<00:03:58.920> out

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
first impressions that really makes out

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.710 
first impressions that really makes out
that<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> SSD<00:03:59.819> is<00:03:59.850> making<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.239> big<00:04:00.510> difference

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
that the SSD is making a big difference

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.750 
that the SSD is making a big difference
because<00:04:01.530> windows<00:04:01.889> April<00:04:02.220> 1<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.459> running

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
because windows April 1 is running

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.310 
because windows April 1 is running
really<00:04:03.030> quickly<00:04:03.120> now<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.780> course<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.199> would

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
really quickly now of course that would

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.870 
really quickly now of course that would
be<00:04:04.350> expected<00:04:04.979> from<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.340> letter<00:04:05.579> that's

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
be expected from a letter that's

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.660 
be expected from a letter that's
completely<00:04:06.239> brand-new<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.650> from

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
completely brand-new but from

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.640 
completely brand-new but from
using<00:04:08.880> other<00:04:09.060> laptops<00:04:09.900> as<00:04:10.020> well<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.410> running

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
using other laptops as well is running

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.589 
using other laptops as well is running
really<00:04:11.010> well<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.550> it's<00:04:11.940> also<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.240> very

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
really well and it's also very very

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.870 
really well and it's also very very
responsive<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:13.620> course<00:04:14.280> because<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.640> the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
responsive of course because of the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.610 
responsive of course because of the
small<00:04:15.270> hard<00:04:15.480> drive<00:04:15.540> are<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.049> expecting

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
small hard drive are to be expecting

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.009 
small hard drive are to be expecting
that's<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.160> performance<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.060> Windows<00:04:18.209> 8.1<00:04:18.510> to

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
that's the performance of Windows 8.1 to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.409 
that's the performance of Windows 8.1 to
go<00:04:19.260> down<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.799> are<00:04:20.519> they<00:04:20.639> be<00:04:20.700> expecting<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.299> to

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
go down and are they be expecting it to

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.180 
go down and are they be expecting it to
get<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> lot<00:04:21.900> more<00:04:21.930> luckier<00:04:22.410> considering<00:04:23.010> that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
get a lot more luckier considering that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.400 
get a lot more luckier considering that
the<00:04:23.340> storage<00:04:23.639> is<00:04:23.820> very<00:04:23.910> limited<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.110> first

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the storage is very limited so first

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.900 
the storage is very limited so first
impressions<00:04:25.889> with<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.100> design<00:04:26.370> I'm<00:04:26.520> really

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
impressions with the design I'm really

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.400 
impressions with the design I'm really
impressed<00:04:27.120> with<00:04:27.270> what<00:04:27.389> HP<00:04:27.780> have<00:04:27.960> done<00:04:28.139> with<00:04:28.290> us

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
impressed with what HP have done with us

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.659 
impressed with what HP have done with us
I'm<00:04:28.590> really<00:04:28.650> impressed<00:04:29.310> they've<00:04:29.550> actually

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
I'm really impressed they've actually

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.879 
I'm really impressed they've actually
managed<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.060> cram<00:04:30.419> such<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> small<00:04:31.169> design<00:04:31.560> into

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
managed to cram such a small design into

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.640 
managed to cram such a small design into
actually<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.220> really<00:04:32.610> low<00:04:32.820> budget<00:04:33.060> PC<00:04:33.600> but<00:04:34.590> of

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
actually a really low budget PC but of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.080 
actually a really low budget PC but of
course<00:04:34.919> as<00:04:35.070> I've<00:04:35.190> mentioned<00:04:35.340> one<00:04:35.760> very

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
course as I've mentioned one very

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.270 
course as I've mentioned one very
misleading<00:04:36.330> thing<00:04:36.900> what<00:04:37.530> HP<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.980> done<00:04:38.100> is

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
misleading thing what HP have done is

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.680 
misleading thing what HP have done is
the<00:04:38.400> fact<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.639> they've<00:04:38.820> said<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.150> got<00:04:39.300> 32

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the fact that they've said it's got 32

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.969 
the fact that they've said it's got 32
gigabytes<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.110> storage<00:04:40.200> but<00:04:40.500> actually<00:04:40.860> it's

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
gigabytes of storage but actually it's

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.650 
gigabytes of storage but actually it's
only<00:04:41.070> got<00:04:41.310> around<00:04:41.580> 81<00:04:42.030> it's<00:04:42.330> actually

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
only got around 81 it's actually

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.570 
only got around 81 it's actually
finished<00:04:43.050> booting<00:04:43.440> Windows<00:04:43.770> 8<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
finished booting Windows 8 and the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.950 
finished booting Windows 8 and the
finest<00:04:44.880> really<00:04:45.180> disappointing<00:04:45.750> because<00:04:45.810> I

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
finest really disappointing because I

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.510 
finest really disappointing because I
think<00:04:46.020> eighteen<00:04:46.470> point<00:04:46.740> five<00:04:46.889> gigabytes<00:04:47.250> just

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
think eighteen point five gigabytes just

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.340 
think eighteen point five gigabytes just
isn't<00:04:47.760> going<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.150> enough<00:04:48.419> for<00:04:48.870> storing<00:04:49.260> all

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
isn't going to be enough for storing all

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.460 
isn't going to be enough for storing all
of<00:04:49.380> my<00:04:49.560> photos<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.160> music<00:04:50.820> as<00:04:51.120> well<00:04:51.330> but<00:04:52.229> later

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
of my photos and music as well but later

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.990 
of my photos and music as well but later
in<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.740> year<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.040> will<00:04:53.190> be<00:04:53.280> doing<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.700> full

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
in the year I will be doing a full

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.790 
in the year I will be doing a full
review<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.570> testing<00:04:54.960> everything<00:04:55.260> formed

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
review of this testing everything formed

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.240 
review of this testing everything formed
the<00:04:56.010> speed<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.210> battery<00:04:57.750> life<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.070> if<00:04:59.160> you

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
the speed to the battery life so if you

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.680 
the speed to the battery life so if you
did<00:04:59.400> find<00:04:59.639> this<00:04:59.729> unboxing<00:05:00.360> helpful

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
did find this unboxing helpful

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.150 
did find this unboxing helpful
definitely<00:05:01.169> be<00:05:01.260> sure<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.470> give<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:01.830> video<00:05:01.979> a

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
definitely be sure to give this video a

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.850 
definitely be sure to give this video a
thumbs<00:05:02.400> up<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.760> thanks<00:05:03.389> for<00:05:03.479> watching

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
thumbs up and thanks for watching

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.830 
thumbs up and thanks for watching
multiple<00:05:04.860> things<00:05:05.130> much<00:05:05.490> easier<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.360> I'll<00:05:06.750> be

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
multiple things much easier and I'll be

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.629 
multiple things much easier and I'll be
taking<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:07.229> look<00:05:07.290> at<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.620> later<00:05:07.889> so<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:08.490> is<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
taking a look at this later so this is a

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.830 
taking a look at this later so this is a
really<00:05:08.880> nice<00:05:09.060> laptop<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.570> I'm<00:05:09.630> really

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
really nice laptop and I'm really

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.480 
really nice laptop and I'm really
looking<00:05:10.110> forward<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.710> getting<00:05:10.979> this<00:05:11.160> booted

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
looking forward to getting this booted

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.520 
looking forward to getting this booted
up<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.210> laptop<00:05:12.510> actually<00:05:12.600> requires<00:05:13.169> that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
up so the laptop actually requires that

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.650 
up so the laptop actually requires that
you<00:05:13.650> put<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.160> power<00:05:14.400> cable<00:05:14.669> before<00:05:15.419> you<00:05:15.510> boot

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
you put in a power cable before you boot

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.029 
you put in a power cable before you boot
up<00:05:15.810> as<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.110> doesn't<00:05:16.260> come<00:05:16.500> preached<00:05:16.710> charged

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
up as it doesn't come preached charged

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.190 
up as it doesn't come preached charged
and<00:05:17.220> also<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.970> power<00:05:18.210> button<00:05:18.539> is<00:05:18.660> on<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.870> side

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
and also the power button is on the side

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.290 
and also the power button is on the side
of<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.440> laptop<00:05:19.640> so<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.729> boot<00:05:20.910> speed<00:05:21.120> is

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
of the laptop so the boot speed is

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.610 
of the laptop so the boot speed is
fairly<00:05:21.510> decent<00:05:21.780> but<00:05:22.140> I've<00:05:22.229> sped<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:22.590> up

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
fairly decent but I've sped it up

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.250 
fairly decent but I've sped it up
because<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.100> does
