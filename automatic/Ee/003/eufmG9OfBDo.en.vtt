00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the gold price still remains 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.700
 unchanged under pressure only in this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.929
 The price of gold fell even lower during the week 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 Brand of 1,200 60 US dollars back 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 Many investors are asking themselves now is the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 large clearance sale of precious metal before 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 that is exactly what we want to talk about today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.480
 with thorsten proettel commodity analyst 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.400
 at the lbbw here in stuttgart pleased 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.320
 as already mentioned at the beginning of the week 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 the gold price fell again massively 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.119
 back how much mario draghi is then 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 currently in the gold price a bit mario 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.899
 draghi is in the gold price on everyone 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.700
 in fact, the ezb-chef has so far 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.590
 managed at the last ezb meeting 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.430
 with new announcements the euro under 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.320
 to bring pressure 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 the us dollar has a mirror image 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 upgraded and a stronger US dollar 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.629
 is bad for gold this is an old one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.820
 play something on the stock market again and again 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 Observe is the last one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.980
 Surprise from the gold price certainly with it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.690
 to do 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 but nonetheless, it was mostly 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 in the week before the very good us 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 economic data that led to it 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 that the gold price has yielded a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.829
 better economy in the us 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 early rate hike and higher 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.220
 interest lends just as bad for the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.720
 gold price as well as a stronger us 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 dollar 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 if the ecb now the money locks 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 Further opens in the United States 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 at least in the medium term, a change in interest rates 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 from that would continue the gold price 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.689
 burden it as I think it will affect everyone 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 If a gold price continues to burden us 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.140
 can assume that the price 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.759
 went to the end of 2014 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.659
 and I still think the first two 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 quarters 2015 direction 1,200 usd each 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.770
 I do not think so 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 that the gold price be further pressure 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 if the interest is first 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 It started when I was tethering 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.869
 the so-called bond purchases 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 throttling 2013 similar to the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.189
 Announcement that it is done in 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.729
 december 2013 has barely more in the gold price 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.009
 hurt 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.110
 also the first implementation in january 2014 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.119
 it was not the discussion in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.430
 on the tethering since then 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 spring 2013 gold price massively damaged 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.310
 and I think it will be at the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 interest rate increase are very similar to the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.520
 discussion for that is harmful if you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.610
 then I think it will come in first 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.100
 price already be priced in 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 Let's wait for our time horizon 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.820
 something already looks out the coming 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.190
 year you are a bit skeptical what the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.720
 further development in the euro area 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 they are already warning about a comeback 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.010
 the euro crisis, this also means that they 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.990
 long term, at least again 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.520
 rising gold prices count as me 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.500
 think of the gold price especially in the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.030
 second half of 2015 again 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.220
 potential from these current ones 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 to resolve depression 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.670
 I justify this forecast pivoting 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.590
 first fundamental 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.510
 I think the Indians will be there until then 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.430
 buy some more gold again 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.959
 I also believe that the mines promotion 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.550
 the currently on record levels themselves 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.590
 something is throttled again 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.780
 because many mines save companies 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.730
 do currently cost massively fall 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 new exploration activities 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 to lay try on ice 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.310
 accordingly, here will be on the future 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.750
 that will be lived at the expense of the future 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.590
 Sometime in the primary offer again 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.360
 to make noticable 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.190
 but yes that will be an additional one 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 be the point when the crisis comes back 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.430
 and I still do not believe that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.540
 we have massive problems 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.250
 the eurozone 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.140
 then the price of gold will be gone 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.790
 can benefit and that the ezb 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.799
 Now the interest has lowered again 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.090
 is certainly not suitable the 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.230
 economic growth in the south too 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.330
 I believe that it is more of a 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.620
 of desperation 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.780
 Last but not least , let's take a look at this 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.209
 black gold the recent price decline 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.430
 in the meantime, oil has misled the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.019
 one or the other producer to something 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.030
 unorthodox measures 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.830
 we are experiencing a very peculiar thing here 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.420
 So a message last by the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.720
 agencies are excited that sinopec 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.190
 this is the state Chinese 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.410
 Petroleum exporter and the total group 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 here from europe tanker looking for the search 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 big tankers this more than 300 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.680
 meters long can take up to two million 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 barrel crude oil and these 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.739
 tanker while came with the cheap 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.110
 Crude oil for immediate delivery 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.900
 he gives filled and 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.220
 at the same time these companies sell 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.780
 forward contracts for the appointment 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.970
 delivery in about five to six 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.780
 Months is oil two to three dollars each 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.950
 barrel more expensive 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.750
 that is only minor 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.070
 price difference but at 2 million 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.690
 barrels a day is coming 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.750
 together what you can earn here and 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.940
 the charter rate currently support 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.680
 That is 26,000 27,000 dollars a day 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.120
 for this is this arbitrage business 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.240
 how many bÃ¶rsians call that one 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.130
 worthwhile business 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.160
 Finally , the view of the price of oil 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.420
 and the prospects for the price of oil is here 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.970
 slowly but surely on the ground 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.410
 reached as I think with us 100 us 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.209
 dollar that we currently see is 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 actually reached such a kind of ground 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.190
 we have a massive one right now 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.330
 Oversupply of oil the economy is not 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.010
 more so round that means it is 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.090
 less oil consumes but the next 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.950
 winter is coming 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.510
 in the northern hemisphere there will be 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.550
 to be used again for more energy 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.530
 heat that up a bit for the price of oil 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.270
 help on the legs and the political 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.770
 crisis we currently see in the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.340
 East-West conflict but also in the near 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.050
 east 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.550
 this will continue to exist 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.900
 currently only hidden I believe that 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.200
 this is because many dealers on vacation 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.390
 are 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.040
 if the return will be yes too 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.450
 this risk will be re-priced 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.980
 and then we think the price of oil one 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.260
 tick may be higher maybe five 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.520
 but not more 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.690
 thorsten proettel commodity analyst 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.800
 the lbbw 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.800
 Thank you for the interview
