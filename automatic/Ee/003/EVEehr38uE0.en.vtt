to even play

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.050

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
to get this nuke and he's just waiting

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.530 
to get this nuke and he's just waiting
for<00:01:19.360> someone<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.970> right<00:01:22.180> he's<00:01:22.300> got<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
for someone all right he's got the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
for someone all right he's got the
airdrop<00:01:23.140> which<00:01:23.590> honestly<00:01:24.190> in<00:01:24.490> my<00:01:24.550> opinion<00:01:24.670> is

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
airdrop which honestly in my opinion is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.290 
airdrop which honestly in my opinion is
useless<00:01:27.340> because<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.680> can<00:01:29.830> always<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:31.060> for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
useless because you can always go for

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.970 
useless because you can always go for
the<00:01:31.330> five<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.930> get<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.110> predator<00:01:32.590> missile

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
the five and get the predator missile

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.690 
the five and get the predator missile
arm<00:01:34.440> which<00:01:35.440> will<00:01:35.680> get<00:01:35.980> your<00:01:36.130> streak<00:01:36.430> up<00:01:36.610> a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
arm which will get your streak up a

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.180 
arm which will get your streak up a
little<00:01:36.910> higher<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.330> what<00:01:38.290> I<00:01:38.320> realized<00:01:38.950> is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
little higher but what I realized is

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.670 
little higher but what I realized is
that<00:01:39.250> all<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.330> air<00:01:40.450> support<00:01:41.250> does<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:42.640> um

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that all of the air support does not um

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.980 
that all of the air support does not um
it<00:01:44.680> just<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.220> flat<00:01:45.640> out<00:01:45.670> doesn't<00:01:46.270> help<00:01:46.869> you

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
it just it flat out doesn't help you

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.690 
it just it flat out doesn't help you
towards<00:01:47.229> your<00:01:47.350> kill<00:01:47.590> streak<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.220> your<00:01:48.490> next

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
towards your kill streak like your next

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.719 
towards your kill streak like your next
go<00:01:48.910> street<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.560> that's<00:01:51.340> what<00:01:51.490> kind<00:01:51.670> of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729

I<00:03:07.060> was<00:03:07.209> doing<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.780> bad<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.049> this<00:03:08.230> game<00:03:09.629> but

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
I was doing so bad in this game but

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.390 
I was doing so bad in this game but
while<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.349> nuke<00:03:11.500> was<00:03:11.709> going<00:03:11.980> off<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.370> was

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
while the nuke was going off and it was

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.039 
while the nuke was going off and it was
in<00:03:12.549> slow<00:03:12.700> motion<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> double<00:03:13.660> spray

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
in slow motion I get a double spray

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.960 
in slow motion I get a double spray
which<00:03:14.319> was<00:03:14.500> pretty<00:03:14.950> awesome<00:03:15.159> I<00:03:17.909> don't<00:03:18.909> know
