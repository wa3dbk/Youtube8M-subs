go by now after this I'm going to put

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210 
go by now after this I'm going to put
another<00:01:29.850> underscore<00:01:30.750> because<00:01:31.380> after<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
another underscore because after that I

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.670 
another underscore because after that I
want<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> add<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.150> sequence<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
want to add a sequence and the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
want to add a sequence and the
underscore<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> helps<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
underscore just kind of helps keep the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.920 
underscore just kind of helps keep the
year<00:01:37.200> apart<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.520> sequence<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.210> soon<00:01:39.810> as

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
year apart from this sequence as soon as

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.289 
year apart from this sequence as soon as

would<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.420> same<00:02:09.720> core<00:02:10.259> file

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
would like to have the same core file

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.420 
would like to have the same core file
name<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> add<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
name but I want to add just a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.849 
name but I want to add just a
little<00:02:12.579> suffix<00:02:13.060> at<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.480> end<00:02:13.659> of<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.019> in<00:02:14.200> order

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
little suffix at the end of it in order

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.099 
little suffix at the end of it in order
to<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.189> this<00:02:15.459> I'm<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.540> remove

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
to do this I'm going to remove

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.429 
to do this I'm going to remove
everything<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.599> insert<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
everything and I'm going to insert the

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.190 
everything and I'm going to insert the
file<00:02:21.040> name<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.329> would<00:02:22.450> keep<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:22.959> same

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
file name so that it would keep the same

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.259 
file name so that it would keep the same
file<00:02:23.590> name<00:02:23.739> but<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.459> would<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.790> add<00:02:24.969> an

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
file name but then I would just add an

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.490 
file name but then I would just add an
underscore<00:02:25.629> m/e

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
underscore m/e

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.830 
underscore m/e
this<00:02:27.010> would<00:02:27.219> be<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.549> my<00:02:27.670> master<00:02:28.299> edited

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
this would be for my master edited

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.929 
this would be for my master edited
images<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.469> I'm<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.859> to<00:02:29.920> take<00:02:30.519> to

images that I'm going to take to
Photoshop<00:02:31.920> likewise<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.099> would<00:02:33.159> save<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.670> by

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
Photoshop likewise I would save this by

trying to keep things simple once we're
done<00:03:10.299> here<00:03:10.719> then<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.859> could<00:03:12.010> go<00:03:12.129> ahead<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
done here then we could go ahead and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.059 
done here then we could go ahead and
select<00:03:12.790> whichever<00:03:13.569> way<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:14.079> want<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.590> rename

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069

these<00:03:15.340> files<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:16.269> right<00:03:16.629> now<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> only<00:03:17.109> have

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
these files now right now I only have

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.680 
these files now right now I only have
one<00:03:17.349> image<00:03:18.040> selected<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.299> I'll<00:03:19.449> actually

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
one image selected so I'll actually

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.809 
one image selected so I'll actually
click<00:03:20.139> cancel<00:03:20.620> because<00:03:21.010> obviously<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.669> would

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
click cancel because obviously you would

export this file we can see here in the
file<00:04:06.220> naming<00:04:06.579> I'm<00:04:06.849> able<00:04:07.479> to<00:04:07.569> select<00:04:07.989> from<00:04:08.290> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
file naming I'm able to select from the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.920 
file naming I'm able to select from the
same<00:04:08.919> templates<00:04:09.579> here<00:04:09.790> so<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.239> would<00:04:10.629> choose

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
same templates here so I would choose

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.140 
same templates here so I would choose
the<00:04:11.259> file<00:04:11.650> naming<00:04:11.889> convention<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.519> has<00:04:12.909> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the file naming convention that has the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.050 
the file naming convention that has the
underscore<00:04:14.049> LR<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.979> then<00:04:15.310> probably<00:04:15.519> change

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
underscore LR and then probably change

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.050 
underscore LR and then probably change
things<00:04:16.389> like<00:04:16.720> my<00:04:17.019> image<00:04:17.440> sizing<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.130> my<00:04:18.729> file

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
things like my image sizing and my file

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.539 
things like my image sizing and my file
settings<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.870> JPEG<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.889> you<00:04:20.979> can<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.310> that

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
settings to JPEG so you can see that

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.570 
settings to JPEG so you can see that
once<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:21.940> create<00:04:22.479> your<00:04:23.080> core<00:04:23.800> renaming

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
once you create your core renaming

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.430 
once you create your core renaming
templates<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.539> can<00:04:25.690> then<00:04:25.840> use<00:04:26.169> them

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
templates you can then use them

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.769 
templates you can then use them
throughout<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.190> Lightroom<00:04:27.400> application<00:04:28.210> my
