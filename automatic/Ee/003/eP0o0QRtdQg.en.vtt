look at this system it has a lot of

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.580 
look at this system it has a lot of
flexibility<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.960> can<00:01:44.080> see<00:01:44.229> with<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> lot

of the design of the system it will

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.179 
of the design of the system it will
quite<00:01:46.990> very<00:01:47.200> clearly<00:01:47.500> have<00:01:47.770> some<00:01:47.979> new
