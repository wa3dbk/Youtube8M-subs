00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello everyone today I have unpacking 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 Here is such a parcel let's see what 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.380
 is inside so inside is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 xiaomi yi camera at minimum 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.039
 bundling i.e. this camera without 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 monopod in such from a little even 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 obskazal tiny box she 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 shipped inside white camera i 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.349
 specially ordered white to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
 it was possible to compare the difference with the green 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 which I already have so that we look 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.260
 is still in the box except the most 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 cameras so at the bottom we have an instruction all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 in the same Chinese language and no word 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 in English and here such here 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.489
 tricky box which is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 micro usb battery cable and more in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.379
 There is absolutely nothing by the way. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.379
 For comparison, I will show now the old one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.740
 box from a family with a monopod is such 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
 That is the difference, that is, a new box 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 really half as much 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.630
 so immediately printed emulator bye 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 there was nothing special to say about the qualities 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.229
 pretty not bad but about him I already 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.570
 narrated 1 unpacking and review 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.900
 yellow camera and so take off the film 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.140
 This beauty looks like this 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.180
 white camera in its own way but 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.630
 They say that she gets dirty let's see 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.070
 of course I use it for a while 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 let's see what state it will be 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
 after several days of use 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.549
 comparable 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.799
 a green camera with on the lena mud and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.049
 Of course the fun looks me on purpose 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.329
 ordered such colors as it is 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.000
 unusual colors for action cameras 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.820
 White cameras, in principle, have been before 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.969
 so that the camera had a yellow sports 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.619
 green color of course for the first time 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.280
 lenses seem to be the same I already 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.580
 forums and saw a mention 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.610
 what lenses are different in color but 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 here it seems they are completely identical 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:19.140
 open the lid so not the first time 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.840
 serial number by the way crookedly glued 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.400
 install the battery there closing 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:32.280
 cover I will get a memory card green 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.660
 cameras and set it in this bay and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.180
 we breed the first inclusion white little 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 by forces 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.360
 the indicator glows purple at that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.590
 says that the battery is charged 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.750
 about 30 40 percent by try 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.660
 connect to it by wifi look 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.480
 what version of firmware on it now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.540
 I clicked the button by the way turning on for 1 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 the green camera looks like this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 LEDs 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.340
 Wi-Fi on both cameras a little bit 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.470
 hue become different take well 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.760
 smartphone and try to connect the camera with 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:17.430
 using the application in the list there are two 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.430
 cameras seem to need to select the bottom 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.410
 all connection is established go settings 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.799
 and look at the firmware version 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.049
 this version is 0 7 10 that is old 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.810
 firmware will need to be updated in order 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.930
 To earn new features here 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.760
 we have no way out 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 impossible to flip the image 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.590
 so that all these functions start 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.650
 work will need to be set to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.519
 firmware manually or through 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.769
 wireless connection 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.840
 but for the time being I won't do it 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.910
 specially ordered additional 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.350
 camera to check how will 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 work she 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.700
 stock firmware from which it will come to 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.980
 what am I saying this because on the green 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.730
 camera I have a problem with discharge 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.520
 battery 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.370
 judging by the information on the forums about 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.190
 20 percent of users face 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.260
 with the problem of full battery discharge 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.739
 per night maximum per day 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:22.000
 I also have a problem, I confirm 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:25.000
 that this is really the case if 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.160
 the camera does not use absolutely less than 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.530
 overnight the battery will be discharged to 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.350
 minimum value no harm it 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 Yaltaru does not put a camera to anyone like that 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.840
 as I have repeatedly checked 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.780
 battery discharges to 3 33 3 volts 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.320
 but when you need to do it urgently 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.300
 a photo 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.220
 are you trying to turn on the camera 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.500
 accordingly it will not turn on at all 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.630
 will have to put it on charge that is, I 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180
 I will try on this white camera 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.090
 see how she will behave 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.520
 will there be this defect and will 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.350
 defect after flashing back to 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.860
 I try to make the camera settings 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.860
 Some photos 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.760
 these are the photos 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:24.850
 I switch to video mode and record with 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.700
 addition video recording on camera 7 or white 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.750
 colors shop we have banggood permission 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.890
 full hd video 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:39.070
 frame rate 60 let's check how it works 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:40.350
 the microphone on this camera is all video recording 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.770
 I finished 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.370
 turn off and so i say on white 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.400
 the camera 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.550
 ringing where I don't know maybe I somehow 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.680
 incorrectly left a stub but i see 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:59.290
 that she doesn't get in place somehow on 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.390
 green camera she hung there better 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.060
 Now I will try to adjust the light principle 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.440
 Now she has become exactly but for example on 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.600
 the green camera the slot cover is always in 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.660
 itâ€™s okay the first time now 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.720
 I will try again to open the slot and 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.760
 you close it 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.190
 Well , look if you are strong 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.210
 look you can see that on the left side 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:28.050
 a little lid bulges if its 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.840
 pin on there goes inside maybe 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.820
 Of course I am carping but it 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.340
 so there really is such a nuance 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.880
 pay attention to Mironov and 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.820
 only got I don't know maybe 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.900
 camera maya can't show but here in 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.030
 this place is already a little spot here 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.260
 llama white camera and and the body is very 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.260
 get dirty quickly 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.720
 on the green camera no problem with 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.670
 stained by dirty hands I did not find 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.530
 I have unpacked this kind of fabric today
