00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.470
 crime 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.090
 and how are truckers 3 long awaited 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.779
 family game 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.739
 did seven years unfortunately he with me 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.559
 I can’t say anything because 

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.720
 there is no barrel then this group aria 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.099
 soundtracks but here we had a fan and he 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.039
 Often, but I will say this: what about crimping? 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.399
 if part 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.099
 however, one of the main revealed 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.609
 that the aria group is no longer surrendered 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.009
 barrels we now have a trendy formula 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.409
 traditions in the parade about which there are four 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.420
 radio stations they all play flat on the street 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.409
 but at the same time 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.909
 you can upload your own benefit 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.439
 music volatile got its role so that 

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.119
 about the principle of loading court sandra kazyna 

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.870
 barrels 2 we can get 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.450
 truckers 2 because and 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.620
 graphic oddly enough game 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.190
 practically no different from the old 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.910
 parts and probably this first shock which 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.990
 likes to experience when turned on 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.000
 truckers that is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 seven years have passed and in the hope that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 truckers praised but 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.940
 now that seeing something amazing 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.280
 three include and I understand that in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 principle practically california which 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.160
 presented in the third part to her 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.950
 no different and that is all to Russian 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.800
 localities which was in the second part 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.870
 but unless from a tree do not grow in auction 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.750
 over the hills but 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.720
 the terrain itself is very poor 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 very poor polygon texture is very small 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.210
 and 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.159
 and but of course it can’t be explained 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.040
 it was possible to calculate and Chris 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 worker kammaleri then one question here 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.280
 how did we get this miracle then 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.570
 but if you move away from the graphics forget it about 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.270
 what we have now is 2009, in principle, there is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.600
 then real engine 3 is constantly coming out but 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 video card is prepared direct x 1 online and stuff 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 other then 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.710
 oh yes we have truckers yes 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.530
 here trucks are more accurate m tractors 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.130
 actions 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 trailer our big which we can 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.549
 the planet this time around america 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.649
 and the memory is gigantic 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.389
 In general, Craig is probably the main thing 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.089
 dignity of the game and maybe because of 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.109
 which is all the same outside it will continue 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.799
 play series j enjoy the game 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.409
 these are sizes 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.469
 local world they are UAH huge if its 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.969
 second trucker in the forests of one end 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.150
 cards to other including 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.200
 here the most massive which was where 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.440
 then in the mountains it was possible to drive, we remember for 20 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.409
 104 issues 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.279
 n one in the province located on people 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.199
 it was and go to the very north take in 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.169
 mainly three real time hours 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.620
 in general, this 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.219
 This figure is less striking because 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.449
 there is an interesting 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.619
 ooo usa is constantly changing well, more precisely 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.620
 even on the landscape 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.849
 yourself road 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.769
 then it is narrow two-way then we 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.749
 what are you 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:00.620
 tons 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.879
 all kinds of giants 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.080
 Ndpi most important that those who were in 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.959
 America to California and confirmed 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.209
 pieces of gifts and various races 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.389
 Well, small cities in all that 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.459
 reminds and looks like 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.849
 but the truth is in america 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.189
 but of course 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.400
 if x him yourself 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.409
 but also the outcome 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.519
 they were taking then he terrain seems 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.189
 taken on change because of this we grow 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.509
 california cypress prices 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.659
 we have all that stuff 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.779
 drove the place green his common 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 it often reminds you 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.679
 near Novosibirsk but I repeat everything and 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.409
 terrain huge 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.639
 them due to which the second part of the goal was 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.159
 popular and for many such 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.010
 interesting but what about could 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.599
 feel the hand but the performance 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.540
 trucker roles 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.220
 what they do in general 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.270
 t presses the gas pedal and two hours inspection 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.299
 glass 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.440
 have tried 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.949
 sometimes viewed from the mirror 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.979
 and those two cygals in this mouth in general 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.159
 n you can do all this 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.179
 truckers three lanes a large proportion 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.109
 and realistic since the blood with him belt 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.409
 Trinity just like the last happiness 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.019
 nothing has changed just not Katyushka we 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.379
 come take cargo 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:27.689
 destination happens 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.389
 task of days of death 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.390
 we carry cargo 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.670
 and therefore we are not in a hurry to consider 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.610
 only for the time that remains until 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.910
 Street of the moment when our contract was 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.240
 actually overdue we bring cargo 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.900
 nevolina 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.700
 extras 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.350
 was there sad swiftly with that 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.870
 that not much to give and everything else 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.080
 there are races and as before which 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.439
 are participating 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.479
 Well, well, three more compositors motto 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:52.919
 equally ship load 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.069
 Edited the same destination 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.770
 and the one who arrived first start teach 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.460
 more money 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580
 But in general, because of what I delivered so far 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.360
 I do not understand because even earlier it 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.620
 annoyed especially when you were chasing 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.699
 his rival he started a sudden 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.319
 stabilization despite that 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.210
 new prime minister milk in 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.309
 bodywork and he reveals his 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:13.969
 milk but also sports a computer and he 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.689
 breaks his own and loses much on it 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.849
 money 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.580
 strange decision 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.189
 as it was left the aging reported from 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.479
 such cleansing when you play third 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.759
 slavers that 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.339
 in response, however, the second part is the same 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.789
 in general, all require after check-in 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.589
 the very whole system with minimal mod 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:34.710
 Siberia 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.970
 m additional costs for barrels 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.340
 development of their companies even physics 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.400
 all the same 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.710
 that is, nothing has changed at all 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.900
 the truck's behavior he drove like the second 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.430
 parts and then it was basically cool 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.300
 stock crisis now again 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.589
 how would seven years have passed 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.239
 because of this, depending on how he flies 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:58.069
 above ground appreciated by road and 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.310
 and watching the UN traffic that commit 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:03.669
 what process becomes shanna 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.029
 maneuvers Litvin should go his own way 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.480
 man whose work 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.220
 as because of the admitted now 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.339
 looks like 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.710
 e of course it can allow 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.580
 developers that is but ask how 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.970
 how did you do that
