hi<00:00:00.989> YouTube<00:00:01.469> I'm<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.429> demonstrating<00:00:03.120> this

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hi YouTube I'm just demonstrating this

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.300 
hi YouTube I'm just demonstrating this
aquarium<00:00:04.170> heater<00:00:04.410> I<00:00:04.560> bought<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.069> my<00:00:05.130> home

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
aquarium heater I bought for my home

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.970 
aquarium heater I bought for my home
brewing<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:05.970> also<00:00:06.660> my<00:00:07.049> perhaps<00:00:07.529> overly

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
brewing and also my perhaps overly

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.459 
brewing and also my perhaps overly
paranoid<00:00:08.250> way<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.150> having<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.260> beer

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
paranoid way of having it in the beer

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.560 
paranoid way of having it in the beer
without<00:00:10.800> actually<00:00:11.190> contacting<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.090> which

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
without actually contacting it which

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.220 
without actually contacting it which
I'll<00:00:12.750> talk<00:00:12.870> about<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> sec<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:14.759> heat<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.230> six

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
I'll talk about in a sec the heat is six

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.910 
I'll talk about in a sec the heat is six
pounds<00:00:16.410> 50<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.070> eBay<00:00:17.460> very<00:00:18.150> cheap<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
pounds 50 from eBay very cheap is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.900 
pounds 50 from eBay very cheap is
thermostatic<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.430> adjust<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
thermostatic you can adjust the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
thermostatic you can adjust the
temperature<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> great<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.470> brewing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
temperature so it's great for brewing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
temperature so it's great for brewing
I'm<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.119> bit<00:00:24.300> paranoid<00:00:24.539> about

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I'm just a little bit paranoid about

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
I'm just a little bit paranoid about
having<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.710> direct<00:00:26.099> contact<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
having it in direct contact with the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.269 
having it in direct contact with the
fermenting<00:00:27.300> beer<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.590> Asian<00:00:29.070> made

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
fermenting beer because a is Asian made

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220 
fermenting beer because a is Asian made
and<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> doesn't<00:00:29.939> even<00:00:30.150> claim<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.990> food

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and it doesn't even claim to be food

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.950 
and it doesn't even claim to be food
grade<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.030> secondly<00:00:33.030> more<00:00:33.329> perhaps<00:00:33.600> more

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
grade and secondly more perhaps more

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
grade and secondly more perhaps more
importantly<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.100> hear<00:00:35.309> stories<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:36.000> them

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
importantly you hear stories about them

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.510 
importantly you hear stories about them
occasionally<00:00:36.420> shattering<00:00:37.380> probably<00:00:38.160> due<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
occasionally shattering probably due to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.630 
occasionally shattering probably due to
thermal<00:00:39.149> shock<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.980> would<00:00:41.280> probably

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
thermal shock which would probably

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.869 
thermal shock which would probably
contaminate<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.750> badge<00:00:43.579> generally<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> don't

contaminate your badge generally I don't

contaminate your badge generally I don't
like<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.329> paranoid<00:00:45.930> about<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.379> sort

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like to get too paranoid about that sort

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.670 
like to get too paranoid about that sort
of<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.430> occasion<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.120> am<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> bit

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
of thing but on this occasion I am a bit

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
of thing but on this occasion I am a bit
so<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:50.850> test<00:00:51.090> set<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.600> water

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
so here you can see my test set up water

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
so here you can see my test set up water
bath<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:53.340> 10<00:00:53.730> meters<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.489> as<00:00:56.489> you've

bath of about 10 meters and as you've
seen<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> sec<00:00:57.570> I've<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.170> heater<00:00:58.410> sat<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
seen a sec I've got the heater sat in a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
seen a sec I've got the heater sat in a
2-liter<00:00:59.550> bottle<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> water<00:01:01.050> bottle<00:01:01.320> with

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
2-liter bottle it's a water bottle with

2-liter bottle it's a water bottle with
the<00:01:01.559> top<00:01:01.829> sawn<00:01:02.129> off<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.940> fit<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the top sawn off so I can fit it in and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.170 
the top sawn off so I can fit it in and
it's<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> few<00:01:05.159> coins<00:01:05.430> set<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> bottom

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's got a few coins set at the bottom

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's got a few coins set at the bottom
as<00:01:06.450> well<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.780> keep<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.680> upright

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
as well to keep it right upright

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.160 
as well to keep it right upright
even<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.600> density<00:01:09.869> wort<00:01:10.619> work<00:01:11.490> sorry<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
even in high density wort work sorry and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
even in high density wort work sorry and
the<00:01:13.170> bottle<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.890> floating<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.909> there

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the bottle is actually floating in there

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
the bottle is actually floating in there
although<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.290> can't<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
although you probably can't see it just

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
although you probably can't see it just
looks<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.939> sat<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> bottom<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
looks like it's sat on the bottom of the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.190 
looks like it's sat on the bottom of the
bucket<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:20.549> takes<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.090> few<00:01:21.600> hours<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bucket it takes a few hours for the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
bucket it takes a few hours for the
water<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.710> equilibrate<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> quote

unquote<00:01:24.630> beer<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.970> I'm

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
unquote beer but as you can see I'm

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.200 
unquote beer but as you can see I'm
hopefully<00:01:28.140> covered<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.340> heater<00:01:29.880> does

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hopefully covered if the heater does

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
hopefully covered if the heater does
unfortunately<00:01:30.420> shatter<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:35.579> got

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
unfortunately shatter and it's also got

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
unfortunately shatter and it's also got
an<00:01:35.939> added<00:01:36.180> benefit<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.960> there's<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> little

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
an added benefit that there's a little

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
an added benefit that there's a little
extra<00:01:37.920> protection<00:01:38.070> against<00:01:39.060> thermally

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
extra protection against thermally

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.910 
extra protection against thermally
shocking<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> heater<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> perhaps

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
shocking the heater and perhaps

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
shocking the heater and perhaps
shattering<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> when<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.299> take<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.810> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
shattering it when you take it out of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
shattering it when you take it out of
the<00:01:43.079> beer<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.680> whatever<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.920> I'm<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.549> going

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the beer or whatever and I'm just going

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
the beer or whatever and I'm just going
to<00:01:47.790> show<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.420> second<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
to show you in a second that the the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
to show you in a second that the the
works<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:51.090> 23<00:01:51.750> degrees<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
works actually at 23 degrees and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
works actually at 23 degrees and
climbing<00:01:52.799> towards<00:01:53.430> 24<00:01:53.970> degrees<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:56.310> can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
climbing towards 24 degrees and you can

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
climbing towards 24 degrees and you can
see<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> ambient<00:01:57.810> temperatures

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
see that the ambient temperatures

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490 
see that the ambient temperatures
actually<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:59.399> least<00:01:59.460> 5<00:02:00.119> degrees<00:02:00.540> lower<00:02:00.570> so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
actually at least 5 degrees lower so
