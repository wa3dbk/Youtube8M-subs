guys<00:00:03.830> the<00:00:04.370> zeppelin<00:00:05.060> mod<00:00:05.240> and<00:00:05.569> i<00:00:06.230> thought<00:00:06.589> it

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:06.770 
guys the zeppelin mod and i thought it

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.860 
guys the zeppelin mod and i thought it
would<00:00:06.859> be<00:00:07.069> better<00:00:07.339> if<00:00:07.640> i<00:00:07.850> showed<00:00:08.300> rovol

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
would be better if i showed rovol

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.560 
would be better if i showed rovol
because<00:00:09.830> i'm<00:00:10.340> too<00:00:10.549> lazy<00:00:10.730> to<00:00:10.969> make<00:00:11.059> a<00:00:11.120> ship<00:00:11.389> and

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
because i'm too lazy to make a ship and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.079 
because i'm too lazy to make a ship and
they<00:00:11.719> already<00:00:11.839> have<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:12.080> ton<00:00:12.290> of<00:00:12.349> ships<00:00:12.650> here

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.089 
they already have a ton of ships here

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.459 
they already have a ton of ships here
i'm<00:00:14.089> going<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:14.420> use<00:00:14.540> like<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.839> medium<00:00:15.259> sized

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
i'm going to use like the medium sized

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.599 
i'm going to use like the medium sized
ship<00:00:15.799> because<00:00:16.670> it's<00:00:16.880> good<00:00:17.150> enough<00:00:17.859> now<00:00:18.859> before

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
ship because it's good enough now before

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.540 
ship because it's good enough now before
i<00:00:19.640> start<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:21.699> to<00:00:22.699> have<00:00:22.910> a<00:00:23.210> craft<00:00:23.980> an<00:00:24.980> aircraft

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
i start this to have a craft an aircraft

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.029 
i start this to have a craft an aircraft
it<00:00:26.210> has<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.170> be<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.429> maximum<00:00:28.429> of<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.590> maximum

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
it has to be a maximum of like a maximum

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.550 
it has to be a maximum of like a maximum
of<00:00:31.660> 1040<00:00:32.660> pieces<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:33.830> you<00:00:33.860> can't<00:00:34.190> have<00:00:34.400> like

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
of 1040 pieces so you can't have like

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.790 
of 1040 pieces so you can't have like
3,000<00:00:36.560> pieces<00:00:37.690> of<00:00:38.690> an<00:00:39.140> aircraft<00:00:39.320> like<00:00:39.650> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
3,000 pieces of an aircraft like a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.250 
3,000 pieces of an aircraft like a
freaking<00:00:40.160> like<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.030> building<00:00:41.450> is<00:00:41.540> too<00:00:41.750> big<00:00:41.990> i

can<00:00:42.770> even<00:00:42.950> use<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.220> building<00:00:43.640> if<00:00:43.820> i<00:00:43.940> cut<00:00:44.180> it

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
can even use that building if i cut it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.410 
can even use that building if i cut it
in<00:00:44.390> half<00:00:44.470> but<00:00:45.470> it's<00:00:45.620> just<00:00:45.800> too<00:00:45.830> big<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:47.300> I'm

anything but it won't take stone so I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.860 
anything but it won't take stone so I
think<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.810> going<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.020> disappear<00:01:45.870> this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
think this is going to disappear this

think this is going to disappear this
this<00:01:47.620> thing<00:01:47.680> cannon<00:01:48.870> let's<00:01:49.870> try<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.410> out<00:01:50.610> Dean

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
this thing cannon let's try it out Dean

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.780 
this thing cannon let's try it out Dean
come<00:01:51.910> on<00:01:52.210> weird<00:01:53.140> ass<00:01:53.670> okay<00:01:54.670> right<00:01:55.510> click<00:01:55.750> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
come on weird ass okay right click and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.310 
come on weird ass okay right click and
notice<00:01:57.790> how<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.940> torches<00:01:58.390> got<00:01:58.600> off<00:01:58.780> because

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
notice how the torches got off because

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.110 
notice how the torches got off because
it<00:01:59.650> doesn't<00:01:59.920> really<00:02:00.010> work<00:02:00.250> with<00:02:00.430> torches<00:02:00.729> but

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
it doesn't really work with torches but

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.500 
it doesn't really work with torches but
you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.710> always<00:02:03.000> enable<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.330> tour

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
you can always enable it and the tour

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.230 
you can always enable it and the tour
just<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.870> pop<00:02:05.680> back<00:02:05.920> on<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:07.090> got<00:02:07.210> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
just like pop back on and you got a

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.949 
just like pop back on and you got a
little<00:02:07.450> extra<00:02:08.020> torch<00:02:09.479> okay<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:10.540> let's<00:02:10.840> try

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
little extra torch okay so let's try

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.490 
little extra torch okay so let's try
that<00:02:11.110> right<00:02:11.290> now<00:02:11.410> right<00:02:12.310> click<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:14.020> found<00:02:14.350> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that right now right click it found the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.130 
that right now right click it found the
craft<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.060> now<00:02:16.060> we're<00:02:16.239> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> use<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
craft and now we're going to use the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.070 
craft and now we're going to use the
number<00:02:17.650> pad<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.450> designed<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
number pad it this is designed for the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.699 
number pad it this is designed for the
number<00:02:20.380> pad<00:02:21.180> plus<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.840> increase<00:02:23.350> altitude

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
number pad plus is to increase altitude

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.670 
number pad plus is to increase altitude
which<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.280> go<00:02:24.489> up<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.120> air<00:02:25.350> minus<00:02:26.350> is<00:02:26.530> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
which is go up in the air minus is the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.680 
which is go up in the air minus is the
decrease<00:02:27.160> altitude<00:02:27.340> such<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.030> go<00:02:28.209> down<00:02:28.480> into

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
decrease altitude such as go down into

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.600 
decrease altitude such as go down into
the<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.860> descend<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.620> use<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.810> 84<00:02:34.810> s<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.280> mean

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the to descend you use the 84 s I mean

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.590 
the to descend you use the 84 s I mean
not<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.560> 84<00:02:38.560> from<00:02:38.709> going<00:02:39.250> forward<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
not the 84 from going forward like the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.960 
not the 84 from going forward like the
speed<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:42.540> 44<00:02:44.010> turning<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> yaw<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.640> left

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
speed the 44 turning the yaw to the left

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.199 
speed the 44 turning the yaw to the left
and<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.890> 62<00:02:47.890> turning<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.280> yacht<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.000> right

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and the 62 turning a yacht to the right

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.850 
and the 62 turning a yacht to the right
so<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.799> WASD<00:02:50.799> except<00:02:51.489> there's<00:02:51.760> no<00:02:52.560> 8<00:02:53.560> I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
so it's like WASD except there's no 8 I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
so it's like WASD except there's no 8 I
mean<00:02:54.070> yes<00:02:54.600> they<00:02:55.600> replaced<00:02:55.930> um<00:02:56.350> they<00:02:57.340> made<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
mean yes they replaced um they made the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.080 
mean yes they replaced um they made the
five<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:59.350> stop<00:02:59.620> everything<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.850> brakes

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
five to stop everything like the brakes

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.410 
five to stop everything like the brakes
so<00:03:01.510> let's<00:03:01.690> give<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.019> shot<00:03:05.489> transition<00:03:06.489> not

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
so let's give this a shot transition not

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.210 
so let's give this a shot transition not
working

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.270

press five to stop it okay that me
something's<00:03:22.079> wrong<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.680> trip<00:03:23.129> okay

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
guess half blocks will come check out

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.699 
guess half blocks will come check out
everything<00:03:34.819> everything<00:03:35.819> seems<00:03:36.030> fine<00:03:36.709> check

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.009 

now<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.849> something<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:51.659> this<00:03:51.780> will<00:03:51.989> happen

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019

and<00:03:52.500> sometimes<00:03:54.290> see<00:03:55.290> now<00:03:55.439> it's<00:03:55.590> connected<00:03:56.010> we

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
and sometimes see now it's connected we

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.729 
and sometimes see now it's connected we
have<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.609> take<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.909> out<00:03:57.170> I'll<00:03:58.170> get<00:03:58.409> back<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> you

when I got it out okay so um I've got

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.250 
when I got it out okay so um I've got
this<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.079> running<00:04:04.489> apparently<00:04:05.489> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
this up and running apparently the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.449 
this up and running apparently the
catwalk<00:04:07.260> or<00:04:07.290> whatever<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.920> call<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.159> a

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
catwalk or whatever you call it a

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.530 
catwalk or whatever you call it a
boardwalk<00:04:09.000> right<00:04:09.569> there<00:04:09.840> was<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.099> problem

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
boardwalk right there was the problem

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.119 
boardwalk right there was the problem
because<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.659> was<00:04:12.750> connected<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.769> was<00:04:13.889> also

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
because it was connected and it was also

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.559 
because it was connected and it was also
connected<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.639> ground<00:04:14.910> which<00:04:15.150> means<00:04:15.419> the

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
connected to the ground which means the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.009 
connected to the ground which means the
whole<00:04:15.720> world<00:04:15.959> was<00:04:16.139> connected<00:04:17.599> so<00:04:18.599> let's<00:04:18.900> give

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
whole world was connected so let's give

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.460 
whole world was connected so let's give
it<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.169> shot<00:04:19.199> again<00:04:20.959> you're<00:04:21.959> joining<00:04:22.139> world

rise<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.509> up<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.720> 10<00:04:31.930> that's<00:04:32.169> how<00:04:32.290> much<00:04:32.350> how

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
rise it up to 10 that's how much how

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.320 
rise it up to 10 that's how much how
fast<00:04:32.949> it's<00:04:33.190> going<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.400> go<00:04:33.520> up<00:04:33.669> see<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.180> bit

fast it's going to go up see it's a bit

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.689 
fast it's going to go up see it's a bit
laggy<00:04:34.540> because<00:04:34.990> it's<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:35.470> much<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.820> ship

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699
