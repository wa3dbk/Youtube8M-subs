00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.820 

actually<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> dragon<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.590> first

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
actually do it was a dragon when I first

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:42.080 
actually do it was a dragon when I first
saw<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:34.760> no<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.000> no<00:00:36.210> dragon<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:41.090> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
saw it and no that's no dragon and you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.910 
saw it and no that's no dragon and you
could<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.360> charge<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.870> attack<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
could do charge up attack but it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400 
could do charge up attack but it
wouldn't<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.870> much<00:00:45.870> difference<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
wouldn't really make much difference as

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
wouldn't really make much difference as
it<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.800> regenerates<00:00:47.340> anyway<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.239> there

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it kind of regenerates anyway but there

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.690 
it kind of regenerates anyway but there
it<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> preacher's<00:00:49.200> daughter<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:50.219> cosmos

very important character from a law

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.959

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
perspective but an optional boss as it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.099 
perspective but an optional boss as it
happens<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:59.149> diamond<00:01:00.149> X<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.809> will<00:01:00.870> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
hardest boss in the game at first but I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.539 
hardest boss in the game at first but I
think<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:04.470> fought<00:01:04.680> him<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:04.979> three<00:01:05.309> times

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
think we fought him like three times

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
think we fought him like three times
once<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.390> game<00:01:06.750> once<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.580> fireman<00:01:08.580> axes

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
once in my game once and fireman axes

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.440 
once in my game once and fireman axes
game<00:01:09.090> manner<00:01:09.710> once<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.610> other<00:01:12.060> dudes

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
game manner once and the other dudes

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.859 
game manner once and the other dudes
game<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.640> yeah<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.850> had<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.689> good

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
game and yeah we had some pretty good

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
game and yeah we had some pretty good
tactics<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:17.780> fighting<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> alone<00:01:19.290> probably

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
tactics down fighting it alone probably

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.380 
tactics down fighting it alone probably
harder<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:22.080> again<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:23.610> giant<00:01:24.030> pusses

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
harder but again like all giant pusses

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
harder but again like all giant pusses
it's<00:01:24.659> basically<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.890> face<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.400> missing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it's basically just a face of me missing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's basically just a face of me missing
my<00:01:27.000> visceral<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.509> technology<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> case<00:01:28.920> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
my visceral or technology it's a case of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.200 
my visceral or technology it's a case of
finding<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.270> safe<00:01:30.659> spots<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.780 

I<00:01:34.270> I<00:01:34.780> think<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.500> burritos<00:01:35.950> might<00:01:36.159> actually<00:01:36.400> be<00:01:36.760> a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
I I think a burritos might actually be a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.300 
I I think a burritos might actually be a
word<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.119> means<00:01:37.390> something<00:01:38.100> similar<00:01:39.100> to

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
word that means something similar to

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
word that means something similar to
like<00:01:39.940> being<00:01:40.150> drunk<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.799> not<00:01:42.070> sure<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.560> m<00:01:47.710> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
is yes it is a lot of the times I don't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.910 
is yes it is a lot of the times I don't
bother<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.659> don't<00:02:29.140> believe<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.560> can't<00:02:29.799> be

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
bother I don't believe I can't be

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.490
