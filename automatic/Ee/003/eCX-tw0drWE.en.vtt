00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.260 
ideas now first off the thing that
stands<00:02:15.470> out<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> game<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.790> control

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
stands out with the game is the control

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.930 
stands out with the game is the control
system<00:02:17.950> quite<00:02:18.950> interestingly<00:02:19.190> you've<00:02:19.640> got

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
system quite interestingly you've got

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.400 
system quite interestingly you've got
either<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.599> traditional

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
either the traditional

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.110 
either the traditional
to<00:02:21.590> click<00:02:21.980> or<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.730> can<00:02:23.030> even<00:02:23.330> use<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:25.130> WASD

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
to click or you can even use the WASD

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.780 
to click or you can even use the WASD
keys<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.720> move<00:02:26.810> around<00:02:27.020> which<00:02:27.680> M<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.220> quite<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
keys to move around which M is quite a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.500 
keys to move around which M is quite a
nice<00:02:28.940> change<00:02:29.210> actually<00:02:29.750> rather<00:02:29.900> than<00:02:30.020> just

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
nice change actually rather than just

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.970 
nice change actually rather than just
the<00:02:32.510> moving<00:02:32.840> around<00:02:32.990> Dustin<00:02:33.560> let<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:33.800> got<00:02:33.950> a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
the moving around Dustin let you got a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080 
the moving around Dustin let you got a
little<00:02:34.130> bit<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:34.460> control<00:02:34.730> over<00:02:34.850> your

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
little bit more control over your

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.660 
little bit more control over your
character<00:02:35.600> there<00:02:36.320> are<00:02:36.440> also<00:02:36.560> times<00:02:36.950> when<00:02:37.400> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
character there are also times when that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.720 
character there are also times when that
you<00:02:37.910> are<00:02:38.210> required<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.810> perform<00:02:39.730> various

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
you are required to perform various

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.520 
you are required to perform various
actions<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.780> would<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:42.170> more<00:02:42.320> an

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
actions that you would get in more an

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.710 
actions that you would get in more an
action-oriented<00:02:43.160> game<00:02:43.640> which<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:43.970> also<00:02:44.540> quite

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
action-oriented game which is also quite

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.780 
action-oriented game which is also quite
nice<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.170> does<00:02:45.350> help<00:02:45.590> breathe<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.340> extra

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
nice it does help breathe a little extra

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.540 
nice it does help breathe a little extra
life<00:02:46.970> into<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.450> game<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.810> keep<00:02:47.960> cover<00:02:48.550> fairly

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
life into the game to keep cover fairly

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.480 
life into the game to keep cover fairly
early<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.790> pretty<00:02:50.150> much<00:02:50.270> in<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> first<00:02:51.490> the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
early on pretty much in the first the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.540 
early on pretty much in the first the
first<00:02:52.700> level<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.720> prologue<00:02:54.170> level<00:02:54.590> when<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
first level the prologue level when you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.690 
first level the prologue level when you
are<00:02:55.880> playing<00:02:56.720> jacks<00:02:58.660> side<00:02:59.660> kinky<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.370> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
are playing jacks side kinky you have a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.960 
are playing jacks side kinky you have a
gun<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> rifle<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.430> are<00:03:04.670> pinned

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
gun you have a rifle and you are pinned

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.330 
gun you have a rifle and you are pinned
down<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.810> have<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.320> stay<00:03:06.650> within<00:03:06.680> cover

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
down and you have to stay within cover

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.510 
down and you have to stay within cover
so<00:03:07.670> there<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> there<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:09.100> sort<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.250> cover

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
so there is a there is a sort of cover

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.330 
so there is a there is a sort of cover
system<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.350> use<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.770> gun<00:03:13.070> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
system you then have to use the gun to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.280 
system you then have to use the gun to
interact<00:03:13.820> with<00:03:14.000> various<00:03:14.570> objects<00:03:15.020> rather

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
interact with various objects rather

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.350 
interact with various objects rather
than<00:03:15.580> traditionally<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.670> going<00:03:16.940> up<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.090> them

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
and pressing them in order to solve e

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.030 
and pressing them in order to solve e
the<00:03:20.600> puzzles<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.170> get<00:03:21.320> away<00:03:21.440> from<00:03:21.590> the

real sort of weird mix of music but
actually<00:06:07.929> it<00:06:07.989> was<00:06:08.110> quite<00:06:08.409> refreshing<00:06:08.649> it's

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
actually it was quite refreshing it's

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.829 
actually it was quite refreshing it's
not<00:06:09.309> the<00:06:09.459> same<00:06:09.669> old<00:06:09.879> music<00:06:10.269> you<00:06:10.389> tend<00:06:10.629> to<00:06:10.689> get

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:14.079 
in his games and as a result actually

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:16.229 
in his games and as a result actually
it's<00:06:14.829> quite<00:06:15.009> can<00:06:15.279> be<00:06:15.369> quite<00:06:15.549> uplifting<00:06:15.759> at

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:16.239 
it's quite can be quite uplifting at

it's quite can be quite uplifting at
times<00:06:16.509> and<00:06:17.399> it's<00:06:18.399> nice<00:06:18.639> to<00:06:18.879> see<00:06:19.029> that<00:06:19.059> they've

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:19.299 
times and it's nice to see that they've

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:20.609 
times and it's nice to see that they've
done<00:06:19.479> that<00:06:19.629> well<00:06:19.839> that's<00:06:20.079> what<00:06:20.289> makes<00:06:20.469> me

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:20.619
