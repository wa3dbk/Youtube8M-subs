00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
elementary schools I think piano is the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.130 
elementary schools I think piano is the
instrument<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.010> every<00:00:17.580> musician<00:00:18.150> will<00:00:18.930> tell

you<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.710> need<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.490> least<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.330> basics

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
play one note at a time the piano you

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.030 
play one note at a time the piano you
can<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:32.700> harmonize<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.770> easy

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
can actually harmonize so it's a easy

our older piano suite kids they can get

our older piano suite kids they can get
a<00:00:40.290> good<00:00:40.590> grasp<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.160> chord<00:00:41.640> structure<00:00:42.059> right

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a good grasp of chord structure right

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
a good grasp of chord structure right
from<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> beginning<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.440> suppose<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.280> violin

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
from the beginning I suppose with violin

you're<00:00:44.969> playing<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.870> note<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.860> don't

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you're playing like one note you don't

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
you're playing like one note you don't
know<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.250> chords<00:00:47.579> under<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
know what chords under it you know it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
know what chords under it you know it
takes<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.289> longer<00:00:49.500> time<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> develop<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.760> idea

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
takes a longer time to develop that idea

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.660 
takes a longer time to develop that idea
of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.379> theoretical<00:00:53.870> structure<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.140> music

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
of the theoretical structure of music

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
of the theoretical structure of music
whereas<00:00:56.670> piano<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:57.960> laid<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
whereas piano it's all there laid out in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840 
whereas piano it's all there laid out in
front<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.309> easier<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
front of you it's so much easier to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.150 
front of you it's so much easier to

engaging<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.100> students<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
engaging thing for students is the
