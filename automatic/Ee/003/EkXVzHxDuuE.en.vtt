this first piece of a rumored leaked

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
this first piece of a rumored leaked
information<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.659> this<00:00:39.780> first<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.229> is<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
information so this first one is a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979

leaked<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.789> an<00:00:42.089> individual<00:00:42.600> who's<00:00:42.809> actually

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
leaked by an individual who's actually

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
leaked by an individual who's actually
need<00:00:43.319> some<00:00:43.499> information<00:00:43.920> before<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
need some information before I think the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
need some information before I think the
game<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.940> called<00:00:45.089> sleeping<00:00:45.600> dogs<00:00:45.870> or

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
game was called sleeping dogs or

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
game was called sleeping dogs or
something<00:00:46.319> like<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> they'll<00:00:47.550> eat<00:00:47.699> some

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
something like that and they'll eat some

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.219 
something like that and they'll eat some
information<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.479> that<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.019> turned

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
information about that and that turned

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.629 
information about that and that turned
out<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.620> true<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> game<00:00:50.280> released

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
out to be true when the game released

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.669 
out to be true when the game released
and<00:00:50.909> so<00:00:51.359> it's<00:00:51.479> a<00:00:51.539> pretty<00:00:51.690> reliable<00:00:52.170> source<00:00:52.499> and

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679

setting of Somalia and it's a flashback

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.270 
setting of Somalia and it's a flashback
of<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.149> soap<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.869> alive<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.500> apparently<00:01:37.920> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
of when soap was alive so apparently we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
of when soap was alive so apparently we
may<00:01:38.429> be<00:01:38.490> playing<00:01:38.759> soap<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
may be playing soap and some of the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
may be playing soap and some of the
previous<00:01:39.840> characters<00:01:40.350> before<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.770> actually

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
previous characters before they actually

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.919 
previous characters before they actually
died<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.359> interested

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
died so that could be pretty interested

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.179 
died so that could be pretty interested
but<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.140> I'm<00:01:43.229> moving<00:01:43.499> on<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.740> second

of<00:01:46.619> information<00:01:46.890> wherever<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> call

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
of information wherever you want to call

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.039 
of information wherever you want to call
it<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.570> actually<00:01:48.689> comes<00:01:48.960> from

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it and this one actually comes from

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.349 
it and this one actually comes from
neversoft<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.009> suddenly<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.490> visited<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
neversoft and suddenly this visited the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.789 
neversoft and suddenly this visited the
studios<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.109> that<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.499> did<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
studios I think that actually did and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.800 
studios I think that actually did and
the<00:01:53.460> managed<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.789> extract<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.240> information

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the managed to extract some information

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.029 
the managed to extract some information
from<00:01:54.929> what<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.259> saw<00:01:55.499> and<00:01:55.619> apparently

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
from what they saw and apparently

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.800 
from what they saw and apparently
according<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.399> them<00:01:56.609> neversoft<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.509> going<00:01:57.719> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
according to them neversoft is going to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
according to them neversoft is going to
play<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> pretty<00:01:58.469> big<00:01:58.710> role<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:58.950> creating<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
play a pretty big role in creating the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
play a pretty big role in creating the
next<00:01:59.880> call<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.090> duty<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:01.469> say<00:02:01.649> it's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
next call of duty and they say it's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
next call of duty and they say it's
going<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.310> another<00:02:02.729> modern<00:02:02.999> warfare<00:02:03.240> game

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
going to be another modern warfare game

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.849 
going to be another modern warfare game
there's<00:02:04.079> something<00:02:04.439> called<00:02:04.560> drone

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
there's something called drone

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.590 
there's something called drone

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
basically like skydiving but with loads

under

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.200 
under
ice<00:02:14.530> there's<00:02:14.890> cloaking<00:02:15.430> technology<00:02:15.670> and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
ice there's cloaking technology and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.270 
ice there's cloaking technology and
something<00:02:16.600> called<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.960> Dominator<00:02:17.410> UAV<00:02:18.010> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
something called a Dominator UAV so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.710 
something called a Dominator UAV so
there<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.580> information<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.660> the

there we have information on one of the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.390 
there we have information on one of the
possible<00:02:20.080> levels<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.530> level<00:02:20.830> under<00:02:21.040> ice<00:02:21.190> is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
possible levels a level under ice is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.770 
possible levels a level under ice is
going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.640> somewhere<00:02:21.880> cold<00:02:22.210> obviously

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
going to be somewhere cold obviously

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.180 
going to be somewhere cold obviously
this<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.440> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.710> either<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.070> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
this is going to either be like the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.180 
this is going to either be like the
Arctic<00:02:24.610> or<00:02:24.790> Russia<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:25.300> maybe<00:02:25.720> Canada<00:02:26.190> there's

only a few select places that that could

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.030 
only a few select places that that could
be<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.200> could<00:02:29.320> be<00:02:29.350> one<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.680> settings

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
in advance of modern warfare 3 but just

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.130 
in advance of modern warfare 3 but just

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
enough time to get that technology in

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.900 
enough time to get that technology in

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
this third thing I'm going to be talking

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.160 
this third thing I'm going to be talking
about<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:54.040> really<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.430> leak<00:02:55.390> or<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> rumor

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
about it's not really a leak or a rumor

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.420 
about it's not really a leak or a rumor
or<00:02:56.230> anything<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:56.830> something<00:02:57.130> I've<00:02:57.190> seen

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
or anything but it's something I've seen

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.310 
or anything but it's something I've seen
floating<00:02:57.670> around<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.150> internet<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.600> lot<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.020> I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
floating around the internet a lot and I

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.260 
floating around the internet a lot and I
just<00:02:59.590> thought<00:02:59.680> I'd<00:02:59.740> clear<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.640> it's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
just thought I'd clear it up and it's

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.180 
just thought I'd clear it up and it's
these<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.810> leaked<00:03:02.110> images<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.890> leaked<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
these like leaked images this leaked a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.640 
these like leaked images this leaked a
poster<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.880> couple<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.870> diesel<00:03:05.170> etrailer

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
poster and a couple of diesel etrailer

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
poster and a couple of diesel etrailer
so<00:03:05.770> I'm<00:03:05.860> just<00:03:05.950> gonna<00:03:06.100> show<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.340> one<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.520> them

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
so I'm just gonna show you one of them

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:17.110 
so I'm just gonna show you one of them
right<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:06.970> why<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.420> need<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> ask

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.020 

I<00:03:17.269> only<00:03:17.930> did<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:18.409> needed<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.830> done

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
I only did what needed to be done

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.620 
I only did what needed to be done
killing<00:03:20.030> me<00:03:20.299> won't<00:03:20.540> change<00:03:20.720> that

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.860 

don't<00:03:24.620> worry<00:03:24.890> we<00:03:25.400> won't<00:03:25.670> I'll<00:03:26.330> ask<00:03:26.570> for<00:03:26.660> my

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
don't worry we won't I'll ask for my

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.660 
don't worry we won't I'll ask for my
nights

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.790 

bunks<00:03:31.560> daughter

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.510 

so<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:38.920> was<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> leaked<00:03:39.340> trailer

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
so that was the leaked trailer

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.970 
so that was the leaked trailer
apparently<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.380> things<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.950> I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
apparently and one of the things that I

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.640 
apparently and one of the things that I
think<00:03:42.370> gives<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.670> away<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.120> makes<00:03:43.390> fake<00:03:43.810> is

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
think gives it away that makes fake is

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.500 
think gives it away that makes fake is
the<00:03:44.920> actual<00:03:45.280> release<00:03:45.610> date<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.150> says

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the actual release date that it says

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.570 
the actual release date that it says
eleventh<00:03:46.960> of<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> 11th<00:03:47.470> 13<00:03:47.890> which<00:03:48.100> falls<00:03:48.460> on

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
eleventh of the 11th 13 which falls on

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.490 
eleventh of the 11th 13 which falls on
Monday<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.270> as<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.840> probably<00:03:49.960> already<00:03:50.260> know

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
Monday and as you probably already know

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.260
