that<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:51.370> other<00:00:51.519> words<00:00:51.760> well<00:00:52.000> one<00:00:52.510> piece<00:00:52.750> of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
that in other words well one piece of

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.040 
that in other words well one piece of
square<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.589> other<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.420> would<00:00:55.570> mean<00:00:55.809> then

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
square to the other that would mean then

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.189 
square to the other that would mean then
that<00:00:56.439> would<00:00:56.890> be<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.159> vertical<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.960> the

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
that would be the vertical but the

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.969 
that would be the vertical but the
horizontal<00:01:00.390> can't<00:01:01.390> really<00:01:01.540> hold<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.869> all<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
horizontal can't really hold it all the

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.469 
horizontal can't really hold it all the
horizontal<00:01:03.189> would<00:01:03.640> mean<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.059> piece<00:01:04.299> of

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
horizontal would mean that a piece of

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.039 
horizontal would mean that a piece of
tube<00:01:04.809> could<00:01:05.110> come<00:01:05.939> both<00:01:06.939> ways<00:01:07.240> although<00:01:07.990> I've

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
tube could come both ways although I've

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.679 
tube could come both ways although I've
got<00:01:08.290> other<00:01:08.500> pieces<00:01:08.830> but<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:10.030> might<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.570> throw

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
got other pieces but I might just throw

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.319 
got other pieces but I might just throw
that<00:01:10.960> together<00:01:11.140> just<00:01:11.909> another<00:01:12.909> little<00:01:13.210> extra

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
that together just another little extra

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.560 
that together just another little extra
anyway<00:01:16.329> what<00:01:16.900> else<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:18.130> think<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.150> lead<00:01:19.329> screw

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
anyway what else I think the lead screw

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.899 
anyway what else I think the lead screw

want it back they said they'd send the
correct<00:01:40.119> y-axis<00:01:41.079> 1<00:01:41.609> which<00:01:42.609> means<00:01:42.789> 10<00:01:43.179> TPI

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
correct y-axis 1 which means 10 TPI

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.620 
correct y-axis 1 which means 10 TPI
obviously<00:01:44.429> well<00:01:45.429> that<00:01:45.609> turned<00:01:45.880> up<00:01:46.090> last<00:01:46.329> week

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
but the reason I wanted to do it was to

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.650 
but the reason I wanted to do it was to
have<00:02:59.890> index<00:03:00.890> pages<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.610> there's<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.970> basically

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
have index pages so there's a basically

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.890 
have index pages so there's a basically
each<00:03:02.720> page<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> list<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.830> stuff<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.900> anybody

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
each page is a list of stuff and anybody
