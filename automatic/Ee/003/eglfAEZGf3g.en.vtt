00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.809
 hi my name is aaron and i am auto 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.049
 and today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.120
 emissions you have to fix the light 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.120
 check engine get it 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.940
 inspected the vehicles are very 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.520
 complexes lets you find out what 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.770
 problems cause your engine light from 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.189
 check we have a sentra of nissan 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.370
 2000 customer says engine light 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.109
 check is on they checked the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.950
 vehicle and found a p 0 138 is a 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:47.050
 sensor code of all 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.330
 p 0 138 says the sensor of all is bad 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.960
 allows to check the circuit to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.420
 make sure that 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.590
 Check the mass and signal 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.100
 reference look for the point 0 3 volts and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.280
 12 volt power supply test 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 with the key and the engine off cables 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.030
 of good replace the sensor and code 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.030
 Clear 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.990
 I observed how the sensor is black 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 caused shell to run the rich 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.000
 the new sensor comes with anti 6 in the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 maintains oxidation 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.900
 after deleting the codes we tested 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.660
 drove the vehicle hooked us the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.530
 scanner backup and codes 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.480
 they did not come back or two sensors are one of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.690
 many parts of the emission that can 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.920
 go out to work see our channel to 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.920
 future repairs 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.230
 and
