00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
just out looking over the v6 engine I

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.000 
just out looking over the v6 engine I
have<00:00:04.920> there<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.460> was<00:00:05.580> talking<00:00:05.940> about<00:00:06.000> for

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
have there that I was talking about for

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.749 
have there that I was talking about for
building<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.550> junkyard<00:00:09.030> Delta<00:00:09.450> crumb<00:00:09.750> I

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
building the junkyard Delta crumb I

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.039 
building the junkyard Delta crumb I
haven't<00:00:11.759> really<00:00:11.940> investigated<00:00:12.570> much<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.929> this

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
haven't really investigated much on this

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.829 
haven't really investigated much on this
engine<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.950> 3.4<00:00:14.670> liter<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.240> GM

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
engine I think it's a 3.4 liter it's GM

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
engine I think it's a 3.4 liter it's GM
anyways<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.180> somewhat<00:00:19.050> seized<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.650> I've

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
anyways it was somewhat seized up I've

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.640 
anyways it was somewhat seized up I've
had<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> couple<00:00:20.490> years<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.500> I

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
had it for a couple years and I think I

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.189 
had it for a couple years and I think I
paid<00:00:22.830> 20<00:00:23.130> bucks<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> scrapyard

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
paid 20 bucks for it at the scrapyard

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
paid 20 bucks for it at the scrapyard
it's<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.619> issues<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.250> far<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.460> actually

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it's got some issues as far as actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's got some issues as far as actually
building<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> deltac<00:00:28.130> like<00:00:29.779> what<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.140> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
building the deltac like what you see is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.799 
building the deltac like what you see is
what<00:00:31.439> I've<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.830> there's<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.570> no

anything like that but I think I can get
around<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.219> problems<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.899> being

seized up that presents a few little

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.369 
seized up that presents a few little
difficulties<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.379> luckily<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.520> had<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.379> handy

I'm going to do something here that most
you<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.659> probably<00:01:46.610> wonder<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:47.880> doing

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you will probably wonder what I'm doing

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
but I got 180 grit sandpaper here and I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.249 
but I got 180 grit sandpaper here and I
got<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.560> cylinder<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.960> causing<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
got one cylinder here that's causing it

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
got one cylinder here that's causing it
so<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> won't<00:01:56.189> spin<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:56.880> around

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so that it won't spin all the way around

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.660 
so that it won't spin all the way around
so<00:01:57.619> excellent

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so excellent

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.510 
so excellent
sandir<00:02:00.670> us<00:02:00.850> seven<00:02:01.240> cylinder<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:02.190> 180<00:02:03.190> grit

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
sandir us seven cylinder with 180 grit

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.780 
sandir us seven cylinder with 180 grit
sandpaper<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:09.070> working<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.640> it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
sandpaper and it's it's working on it

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.820 
sandpaper and it's it's working on it
there<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.900> spend<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.230> few<00:02:11.380> minutes<00:02:11.530> doing

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
there so if I spend a few minutes doing

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.790 
there so if I spend a few minutes doing
that<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:13.180> I'll<00:02:13.300> get<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.020> it'll<00:02:14.170> spin

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
that here I'll get it so that it'll spin

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520 
that here I'll get it so that it'll spin
over<00:02:14.950> relatively<00:02:15.520> freely<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.930> main<00:02:17.110> reason<00:02:17.440> I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
over relatively freely the main reason I

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.560 
over relatively freely the main reason I
wanted<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.070> was<00:02:18.360> none<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
wanted to do that was none of the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.360 
wanted to do that was none of the
pistons<00:02:19.990> were<00:02:20.170> at<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> top<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:20.980> couldn't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
pistons were at the top so I couldn't

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.070 
pistons were at the top so I couldn't
measure<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.770> stroke<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.460> find<00:02:24.700> out<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.990> know

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
measure the stroke to find out you know

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.170 
measure the stroke to find out you know
what<00:02:26.290> size<00:02:26.530> engine<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.100> another<00:02:27.820> thing<00:02:28.060> I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
what size engine it is another thing I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.700 
what size engine it is another thing I
discovered<00:02:28.420> when<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.990> Pistons<00:02:29.380> are<00:02:29.500> at<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
discovered when the Pistons are at the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.040 
discovered when the Pistons are at the
top<00:02:29.950> they<00:02:30.820> seem<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> extend<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.780> little<00:02:31.900> bit

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
top they seem to extend a little bit

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.080 
top they seem to extend a little bit
past<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.680> top<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.100> block<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.790> so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
past the top of the block on this so

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.800 
past the top of the block on this so
that<00:02:34.300> would<00:02:35.820> cause<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> little<00:02:37.480> bit<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.720> an

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that would cause a little bit of an

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.200 
that would cause a little bit of an
issue<00:02:37.960> in<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.710> would<00:02:38.800> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.190> grind<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
issue in that you would have to grind a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.940 
issue in that you would have to grind a
recess<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.450> plate<00:02:43.620> head<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.830> I'm

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
recess in the the plate head that I'm

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.590 
recess in the the plate head that I'm
putting<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.430> there<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
putting on there just so that the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.930 
putting on there just so that the
Pistons<00:02:47.020> clear<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.440> although<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.370> guess<00:02:48.910> a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
Pistons clear it although I guess a

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.090 
Pistons clear it although I guess a
person<00:02:49.210> could<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.810> put<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.020> head<00:02:50.200> gasket<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
person could just put a head gasket on a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.580 
person could just put a head gasket on a
lot<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.760> times<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.300> do<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.080> guess

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
lot of times I don't do that but I guess

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.590 
lot of times I don't do that but I guess
in<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:53.890> case<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> head<00:02:54.760> gasket<00:02:54.970> would<00:02:55.420> be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
in this case a head gasket would be

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.600 
in this case a head gasket would be
simplest<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.590> then<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:56.950> could<00:02:57.160> just<00:02:57.370> go<00:02:57.490> with

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
simplest and then you could just go with

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.290 
simplest and then you could just go with
a<00:02:57.700> flat<00:02:57.940> plate<00:02:58.210> head<00:02:58.680> anyways<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.710> wanted<00:03:00.220> to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
a flat plate head anyways just wanted to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.870 
a flat plate head anyways just wanted to
show<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.360> what<00:03:01.600> I'm<00:03:01.690> doing<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:03.760> her

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
show you what I'm doing here to get her

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.360 
show you what I'm doing here to get her
