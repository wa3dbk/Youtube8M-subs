00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.300 
comfortable with it since of a kind of
ukulele<00:03:31.240> that's<00:03:31.960> all<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.170> want<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.620> just

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
ukulele that's all I want to do I just

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.830 
ukulele that's all I want to do I just
feel<00:03:33.550> like<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:33.820> natural<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.360> finger<00:03:34.630> pick

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
feel like it's natural to finger pick

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.860 
feel like it's natural to finger pick
the<00:03:35.800> way<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:35.920> learned<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.480> hold

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
the way I learned it is that you hold

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.280 
the way I learned it is that you hold
the<00:03:38.140> ukulele<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:40.330> kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.600> support<00:03:40.990> it<00:03:41.080> with

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
the ukulele you kind of support it with

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.610 
the ukulele you kind of support it with
these<00:03:41.470> three<00:03:42.430> fingers<00:03:42.640> or<00:03:43.120> two<00:03:43.720> fingers<00:03:44.140> some

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
these three fingers or two fingers some

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.870 
these three fingers or two fingers some
people<00:03:44.800> might<00:03:44.950> like<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> use<00:03:45.310> two<00:03:45.520> fingers<00:03:45.550> but

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
people might like to use two fingers but

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760 
people might like to use two fingers but
basically<00:03:46.150> support<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.600> with<00:03:46.720> three<00:03:47.380> fingers

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
basically support it with three fingers

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.130 
basically support it with three fingers
and<00:03:47.980> then<00:03:48.070> pick<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.330> thumb<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:49.900> with

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
and then pick with the thumb and with

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.930 
and then pick with the thumb and with
the<00:03:50.230> index<00:03:50.500> finger<00:03:50.590> kind<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.130> just<00:03:51.280> gonna<00:03:52.890> and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the index finger kind of just gonna and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.280 
the index finger kind of just gonna and
yellow<00:03:54.940> birds<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.390> think<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.570> good<00:03:55.690> example<00:03:56.020> of<00:03:56.230> a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
yellow birds I think a good example of a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:20.560 
yellow birds I think a good example of a
finger<00:03:56.740> picking<00:03:56.950> because

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.870 

you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.810> fly<00:04:22.080> away<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.070> sky<00:04:23.400> away<00:04:23.670> you

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
you can fly away in the sky away you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.510 
you can fly away in the sky away you
more<00:04:24.510> lucky<00:04:25.110> than<00:04:25.140> me<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.680> again<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.400> could

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
more lucky than me and again you could

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.370 
more lucky than me and again you could
do<00:04:29.640> some<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.000> those<00:04:30.120> same<00:04:30.390> devices<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.140> taught

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
do some of those same devices I taught

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.160 
do some of those same devices I taught
in<00:04:33.140> three<00:04:34.140> little<00:04:34.320> birds<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:36.900> do<00:04:37.020> some

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
in three little birds you can do some

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.140 
in three little birds you can do some
little<00:04:37.290> grace<00:04:37.650> notes<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.700> lot<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.000> times

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
little grace notes but a lot of times

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.220 
little grace notes but a lot of times
you<00:04:39.270> want<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.480> do<00:04:39.540> too<00:04:39.690> much<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.020> because

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
you want to do too much of that because

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.560 
you want to do too much of that because
it<00:04:40.320> gets<00:04:40.470> kind<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.740> messy<00:04:40.920> lifetimes<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.700> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
it gets kind of messy lifetimes the the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.390 
it gets kind of messy lifetimes the the
just<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.990> nice<00:04:43.170> finger<00:04:43.440> picking<00:04:43.740> itself<00:04:44.220> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
just a nice finger picking itself the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760 
just a nice finger picking itself the
ukulele<00:04:44.880> just<00:04:45.120> gives<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.260> much<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.620> don't

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
ukulele just gives so much you don't

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
know what times have to doctor it up too

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.530 
know what times have to doctor it up too
much<00:04:48.900> keep<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.860> simple<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.300> be<00:04:51.390> really

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
about that it's good to alternate I

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.930 
about that it's good to alternate I
usually<00:05:09.470> like<00:05:09.620> like<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.400> hit<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.640> two

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
usually like like like I hit the two

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
just like that see and it takes a little

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.210 
just like that see and it takes a little
practice<00:05:39.730> I'm<00:05:40.730> not<00:05:40.910> saying<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.240> easy<00:05:41.360> but

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
practice I'm not saying it's easy but
