 got this feat because I wanted to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.439
 that would not really get you 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.189
 I say it and when I took my adn I said 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.169
 oysters I finally have the DNA removed me 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.640
 this Christmas is worth recently that 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.739
 you are watching this video well for 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.149
 to see today, Tuesday, I took it out 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.770
 a week ago so what happens with the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.390
 upload earlier to the channel because I wanted to 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.860
 prepare a good comment wanted 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.840
 tell you a few things in 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.460
 previous videos that you have already had 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 in the channel people are good then 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 well here you see that they are a between 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.920
 court because it changes the game round 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.350
 ok and good first thing I wanted 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 highlight is that in doing two ruthless 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.190
 two races of 10 before I got the dna 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.080
 then it is a real killing 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.670
 game and then you see that he killed two 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.350
 before the first round is over and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.720
 in the second round and then I take out the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.340
 ferocious and how I war killed me a few 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.450
 finally finally I get the dna 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.820
 making me think that a few 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.650
 unstoppable so perfect and here you see 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.780
 that was playing with the pal will silence 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.090
 with head and handle and rats 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.369
 in which you see through the walls 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.530
 as if it were a now with the pen with 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.820
 extra time and the word beat with aggressor 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.740
 it goes to the people then good very 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.299
 happy as I said, I 'm so 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.009
 excited commented commenting this 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.530
 gameplay and here you see that they already had the 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.540
 three streaks here threw the pm he sees it and it's 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 a not stopping an authentic not stopping because 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.899
 the ademeba pulled out in a round of dominance 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.490
 in five minutes and the truth is that 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.899
 pretty quickly because I what I 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.220
 like is to have enough time to 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.110
 get it because if not then 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 you have already pulled out like I had to go in 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.290
 this gameplay that shot the DNA 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.300
 you will see it and you can see it when the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.619
 people then good here you see I'm going 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.330
 taking weapons from the ground this one that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.340
 I was getting yesterday a ship there is new 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.840
 if you want what I upload to the channel 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.530
 has gone more than asking me what do you put in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.420
 the comments 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.770
 and I upload it to the channel because you get 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.090
 like inside a secret area and it's 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.950
 pretty cool to troll if what 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.420
 you want to do so you leave me a 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.890
 comment and I upload the tutorial in 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.569
 as much as I can and here you can see that I'm going 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 taking weapons from the ground since he did not have 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.019
 scavenger had no scavenger and why 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.580
 because I want to talk about a very important topic 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.590
 important I'm playing with the account 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.390
 of subscribers with the ibi account the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.160
 crack 10 there you are seeing it in the fit 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.989
 ev and the crack watching with mine privately 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100
 with which I play with my friends what happens 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.340
 because you are when with is there and 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.170
 when are you going to do direct 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 writer is good what direct what 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
 I will answer in the questions and answers 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.959
 that you most likely have the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.160
 Thursday in this week you will have it 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.110
 end of this week the best is 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.340
 I will upload week and finally in questions and 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.019
 answers that you have made me a million 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.030
 of questions but what I wanted 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.650
 tell me is because I'm playing with 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.970
 this account and well everything has a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.670
 why and I'm playing with this account 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 because I found out that when in this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 colloquium and not with a tweet and advance 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.580
 warfare when you search for the game 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.950
 matchmaking what is it that makes you 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.980
 look for a game you are looking for with people of your 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.630
 same level and of your same proportion 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.610
 then good because it made me 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.900
 think because I always if you are very 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.519
 subscribers quite active in the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.290
 channel whenever I uploaded a video I 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.390
 began to say do not hear is not 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.799
 subscribers that we are using not 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.690
 there are no bad people in the other guy 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.340
 never killed never touch bad people in 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.810
 the other team are all very good not 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.970
 weigh with a gameplay it costs me a lot 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.379
 get me out gameplays was always like this if 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.209
 you are active subscribers in the channel 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.620
 you will know perfectly well then 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.879
 I was always complaining about that 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.590
 that there were no bad people in the game 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.930
 I understand why and then when I 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.690
 I found out about this I said wait wait 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.400
 wait I'll do a test I got to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.110
 call of duty advanced warfighter 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.269
 with the subscribers account and I saw the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.799
 crack that was at level 0 and 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.069
 when I got into the first game 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.530
 they were all level 1 or level 2 people 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.769
 level 5 as much and some other 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.720
 double command and I said clear clear this is 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.609
 the key bitch kids this is the key 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.930
 and I said nothing then I'm going to start 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.579
 play with this account a little bit to see 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.170
 if I get a job and what other and 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.549
 here you see it was at the level I think 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.280
 20 or so and how I was playing 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.010
 against people who were quite worse then 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.840
 well get the DNA and this 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.190
 it made me think because I stayed 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.629
 pretty crazy when I found out that the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.579
 matchmaking that makes this call of duty 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.139
 is with people of your same proportion and of 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.760
 your same level that's why I wanted to try it 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.079
 got into my account that there was not with the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.909
 account subscribers who had not played 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.470
 never to this color I told you jump the 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.819
 brutal had never played this color and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.159
 with this account and when I said it started to 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.989
 play against pretty bad people because 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.060
 they were lower levels were levels of 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.470
 when you start the game, then clipe 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.150
 because I was swelling I was coming out 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 incredible gameplays then well then 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.630
 I have a lot of gameplays 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.099
 for the incredible channel because I've 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.690
 played with the rock to world account 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.160
 I played with the subscribers account 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.870
 and it has taken me a lot of 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.310
 pretty good one level gameplays 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.700
 that I did not think I was going to bring to the channel 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.530
 A) Yes 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.180
 from time to time if you see a game that 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.500
 it's not so good it's of such a high level 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.000
 like what you are seeing now in the background 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.490
 do not worry because I have many 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.160
 many many games recorded with me 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.930
 account of the guard and you see the but by 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.400
 end with the guards bar low and vi 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.080
 that I have almost two of proportion and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.760
 look for where you are looking for very good people and there 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.230
 I have pretty cool streaks but not 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.150
 I have killings like the ones I'm 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.260
 doing with this account that I'm in a 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
 pretty low level and he's touching me 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.830
 pretty bad people and it is that I am 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.300
 flipando is worth people then well then 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.250
 I also found out that there is a lot 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.450
 people who commit suicide commit suicide so 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.310
 it would be worse people to lower the 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.930
 proportion then what to me I do not 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.790
 block is because pussy have done in this 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.830
 call of duty what of the match making so the 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.120
 call of duty is always the same if it touches you 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.920
 against bad people, you are lucky 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.510
 to take advantage of it and take your departure 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.800
 but if you always play against people 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.660
 well you will not be able to bring games 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.700
 good and also youtubers us 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.200
 the youtubers I'm in call of duty 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.940
 advanced work fair the best I am all 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.500
 the afternoon to get me a game that 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.690
 the best is a 40 days with my account 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.100
 deprived of the guard low and I saw when 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.720
 in white less arrived and the best 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.550
 here you see the DNA here you see here the 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.500
 view vouchers and good when wearing a 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.300
 2 mouse and blank only improves the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.639
 second game so I already had a gameplay 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.189
 I had a 32 I had a 40 5 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.870
 I already had gameplay in yuty advanced 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.699
 worker does not pass this because they have done 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.199
 this the matchmaking for the youtubers 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.520
 They have fucked us a lot since we did not 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.289
 look against bad people 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.599
 he wants to know he does not want to apply 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.759
 either but if you're pretty good or if 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.460
 you have a ratio of one to 617 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.110
 as it is more or less mine because surrounding 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.029
 two practically not looking for you 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.009
 against people for nothing bad then it 's 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.169
 very difficult to get exploits 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.759
 pretty good in this color and how is it 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.289
 an adn there how are you then when 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.849
 I started playing with the tip of crai 10 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.009
 and when I started playing with the account 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.050
 of the robot had the one that I did I started to see
