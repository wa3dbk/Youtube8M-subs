00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello this video on the channel 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.580
 denominations we are now on 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.160
 computex 2015 time on taipei 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.980
 and now i'm looking at a new asus zenfone 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.619
 2 links that are from the usual zenfone 2 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.560
 different here is such a hoot in the center 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.630
 this is a front camera which is nothing 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.939
 practically does not differ from the main 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 camera she also has a resolution of 13 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.109
 megapixels and if we run it you 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 will see 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.390
 not real picture, we are now looking 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 look back now switch to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.860
 front camera and virtually nothing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 changed that is maximum 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 the resolution is all very, very cool 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.090
 changing exposure there is autofocus there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 even such a trick so that hands do not tremble 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.410
 you can drink and second delay 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.410
 do and now do so 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.370
 only 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.160
 here and even the flash fires 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.620
 both front and back they are the same 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.059
 they have skin color correction i think 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.890
 everyone is familiar with when you 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.770
 take pictures of the flash that are beating 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.900
 you are right in the eyes of half of people like that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.299
 half just gray here it is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.220
 draws out skin color and everything is obtained 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.320
 very beautiful but even less so if you 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.670
 got with ugly i think you with this 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.039
 often encountered 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.060
 there are all sorts of functionalities by 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.740
 improve beauty case you can say 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.690
 dear now i will make you beautiful 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 better never say so just 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.250
 Take it and set it up 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.530
 just like a girl from anime look even with 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.600
 a beard 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.100
 damn, I now like myself in everything 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 the rest is almost the same 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 zenfone 2 the only difference here 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.030
 The processor is not from intel but from qualcomm 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.069
 here also up to 4 gigabyte operational 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.509
 memory there is a button behind asus says 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.610
 that it is much more convenient 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.979
 matter in the center with her well here 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.110
 a matter of taste someone like more 5 5 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.659
 inch display with full hd resolution 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.420
 generally powerful last minute stuff 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.479
 practically versions of android 50 on top of it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.879
 corporate bun from asus in general everything 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.099
 nicely comfortable but most importantly links and 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:12.099
 whole company very high quality sales
