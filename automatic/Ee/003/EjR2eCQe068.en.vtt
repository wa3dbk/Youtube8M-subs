00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
the right float to the right div so I'll

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.150 
the right float to the right div so I'll
create<00:07:09.210> another<00:07:09.300> CSS<00:07:09.900> rule<00:07:10.380> I'll<00:07:10.590> click<00:07:10.800> OK<00:07:13.160> go

create another CSS rule I'll click OK go
to<00:07:14.220> box<00:07:14.520> like<00:07:15.450> right<00:07:16.100> apply<00:07:17.100> ok<00:07:17.640> as<00:07:17.940> you<00:07:18.450> can

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
to box like right apply ok as you can

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.950 
to box like right apply ok as you can
see<00:07:18.990> once<00:07:19.260> the<00:07:19.550> right<00:07:20.550> float<00:07:20.970> CSS<00:07:21.570> rule<00:07:21.780> has

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
see once the right float CSS rule has

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.680 
see once the right float CSS rule has
been<00:07:21.990> applied<00:07:22.380> to<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.890> right<00:07:23.100> div<00:07:23.340> tag<00:07:23.690> the

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:24.690 
been applied to the right div tag the

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.770 
been applied to the right div tag the
right<00:07:25.590> div<00:07:26.010> tag<00:07:26.310> kind<00:07:26.700> of<00:07:26.850> collapses<00:07:27.630> on

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
right div tag kind of collapses on

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.290 
right div tag kind of collapses on
itself<00:07:27.950> or<00:07:28.950> kind<00:07:29.280> of<00:07:29.370> shrinks<00:07:29.850> to<00:07:30.000> the<00:07:30.120> right

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
itself or kind of shrinks to the right

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.780 
itself or kind of shrinks to the right
and<00:07:30.620> floats<00:07:31.620> to<00:07:31.860> the<00:07:31.980> right<00:07:32.130> so<00:07:32.310> it<00:07:32.430> gets<00:07:32.580> taken

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
and floats to the right so it gets taken

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.420 
and floats to the right so it gets taken
out<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.060> its<00:07:33.300> long<00:07:33.510> position<00:07:34.290> and<00:07:34.530> floats<00:07:35.190> to

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
out of its long position and floats to

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.740 
out of its long position and floats to
the<00:07:35.550> right<00:07:37.580> if<00:07:38.580> you<00:07:38.700> didn't<00:07:39.240> have<00:07:39.390> the<00:07:39.510> float

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
the right if you didn't have the float

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.960 
the right if you didn't have the float
rule<00:07:39.960> assigned<00:07:40.320> to<00:07:40.440> either<00:07:40.590> of<00:07:40.890> them<00:07:41.100> like

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
rule assigned to either of them like

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.560 
rule assigned to either of them like
before<00:07:42.650> basically<00:07:43.650> the<00:07:44.220> right<00:07:44.460> div<00:07:44.729> tag<00:07:45.030> would

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.570 
before basically the right div tag would

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.600 
before basically the right div tag would
be<00:07:45.720> placed<00:07:46.020> with<00:07:46.200> directly<00:07:46.680> beneath<00:07:46.919> the<00:07:47.340> Left

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:47.610 
be placed with directly beneath the Left

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.800 
be placed with directly beneath the Left
div<00:07:48.180> tag<00:07:48.479> and<00:07:49.790> that<00:07:50.790> about<00:07:51.030> sums<00:07:51.330> it<00:07:51.479> up<00:07:51.570> for

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:51.810 
div tag and that about sums it up for

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.110 
div tag and that about sums it up for
