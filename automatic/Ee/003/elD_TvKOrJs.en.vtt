hello<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.780> Steve<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.680> fluorescent

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hello this is Steve from the fluorescent

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello this is Steve from the fluorescent
flying<00:00:02.610> penguins<00:00:03.179> today<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.710> be

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
flying penguins today I'm going to be

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.889 
flying penguins today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.520> logic<00:00:05.940> operations<00:00:06.629> block

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
talking about the logic operations block

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.770 
talking about the logic operations block
and<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.740> does<00:00:08.240> what<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.300> logic

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
and what it does what the logic

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.230 
and what it does what the logic
operations<00:00:10.469> block<00:00:10.769> does<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.790> allows<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
operations block does is it allows you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.039 
operations block does is it allows you
to<00:00:12.360> take<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:13.200> logic<00:00:14.130> answers<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.049> compare

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to take to logic answers and compare

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.170 
to take to logic answers and compare
them<00:00:16.230> against<00:00:16.650> each<00:00:16.800> other<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.640> make<00:00:17.760> another

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
them against each other to make another

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.260 
them against each other to make another
answer<00:00:18.960> depending<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.640> setting<00:00:21.119> you

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
answer depending on which setting you

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.609 
answer depending on which setting you
have<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.890> settings<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:24.619> XOR

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
have it on the settings are and or XOR

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.279 
have it on the settings are and or XOR
and<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:27.920> okay<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> explain

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and not okay so now I'm going to explain

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
and not okay so now I'm going to explain
all<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.679> them<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
all of them to you and what they do the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.160 
all of them to you and what they do the
first<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.730> what<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> does<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.690> asks<00:00:36.809> if

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
first one and what it does is it asks if

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.090 
first one and what it does is it asks if
both<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.680> B<00:00:38.340> are<00:00:38.370> true<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.469> then

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
both a and B are true if they are then

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.180 
both a and B are true if they are then
it<00:00:41.280> gives<00:00:41.489> out<00:00:41.760> an<00:00:42.000> answer<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> says<00:00:43.260> true<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it gives out an answer that says true so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.600 
it gives out an answer that says true so
not<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.670> gives<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.210> answer<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.840> false

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
not it gives out an answer that's false

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
not it gives out an answer that's false
so<00:00:47.610> let's<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.809> two<00:00:49.610> logic<00:00:50.610> constant<00:00:51.239> blocks

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so let's take two logic constant blocks

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.979 
so let's take two logic constant blocks
and<00:00:52.410> plug<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.180> first<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.840> make

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and plug them in so first let's make

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:04.250 
and plug them in so first let's make
them<00:00:55.199> both<00:00:55.260> true<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.180> happens<00:01:03.260> as

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
them both true to see what happens as

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
them both true to see what happens as
you<00:01:04.320> could<00:01:04.799> hear<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.280> said<00:01:05.580> yes<00:01:05.880> because

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you could hear it said yes because

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
you could hear it said yes because
they're<00:01:06.659> both<00:01:06.869> true<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.860> change<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
they're both true if I change one of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.490 
they're both true if I change one of
them<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> false<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.930> download<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.380> run

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
them to false and then download and run

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.969 
them to false and then download and run
as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.159> could<00:01:14.340> hear<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> said<00:01:15.750> no<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
as you could hear it said no because it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
as you could hear it said no because it
it<00:01:17.790> didn't<00:01:18.180> give<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> true<00:01:19.049> reading<00:01:21.770> okay

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it didn't give out a true reading okay

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
it didn't give out a true reading okay
so<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.100> next<00:01:23.369> setting<00:01:23.729> after<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> called

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so the next setting after that is called

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
so the next setting after that is called
or<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.299> does<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.680> asks<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.250> either<00:01:29.520> A

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or what or does is it asks if either A

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
or what or does is it asks if either A
or<00:01:30.090> B<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:31.049> true

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
or B is true

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.770 
or B is true
if<00:01:31.799> either<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> true<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.600> gives

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
if either one of them is true it gives

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.340 
if either one of them is true it gives
out<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> reading<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> says<00:01:35.369> true<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.479> neither

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
out a reading that says true if neither

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
out a reading that says true if neither
them<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.920> true<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> gives<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
them are true then it gives out a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
them are true then it gives out a
reading<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.020> says<00:01:40.470> false<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.820> theoretically

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
reading that says false so theoretically

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.440 
reading that says false so theoretically
if<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> change<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.000> should<00:01:45.210> say

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
if I change this to or this should say

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
if I change this to or this should say
yes<00:01:45.780> let's<00:01:46.439> download<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> run<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:49.189> as<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
yes let's download and run it as you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
yes let's download and run it as you
could<00:01:50.850> hear<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.210> played<00:01:51.540> yes<00:01:51.780> cuz<00:01:52.049> because

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
could hear it's played yes cuz because

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.590 
could hear it's played yes cuz because
one<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> true<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.149> I'll<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.479> what

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
one of them is true so I'll see what

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
one of them is true so I'll see what
houses<00:01:54.750> they're<00:01:55.200> both<00:01:55.380> true<00:01:58.009> said<00:01:59.009> yes

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
houses they're both true said yes

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.880 
houses they're both true said yes
because<00:01:59.579> still<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.780> true<00:02:01.079> but

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
because still one of them was true but

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
because still one of them was true but
if<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.729> both<00:02:02.939> false<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:08.060> as<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
if we make them both false then as you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.119 
if we make them both false then as you
could<00:02:09.509> hear<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.959> didn't<00:02:10.379> say<00:02:10.560> yes<00:02:10.830> because

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
could hear it didn't say yes because

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.220 
could hear it didn't say yes because
they<00:02:11.550> were<00:02:11.610> both<00:02:11.819> false<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.420> gave<00:02:12.690> out<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> false

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
they were both false so gave out a false

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.280 
they were both false so gave out a false
reading

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
reading

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.320 
reading
okay<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.590> next<00:02:16.770> setting<00:02:17.190> after<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.910> is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
okay so the next setting after that is

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.030 
okay so the next setting after that is
called<00:02:18.810> X<00:02:19.170> or<00:02:19.790> what<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.000> does<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.110> asks<00:02:22.290> if

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
called X or what that does is it asks if

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.480 
called X or what that does is it asks if
only<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.610> them<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.030> true<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.950> should

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
only one of them is true so this should

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.000 
only one of them is true so this should
say<00:02:26.790> no<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.480> let's<00:02:27.660> test<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:30.350> as<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.770> hear

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
say no so let's test it as you can hear

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.680 
say no so let's test it as you can hear
it<00:02:32.130> said<00:02:32.400> no<00:02:32.610> because<00:02:32.760> neither<00:02:33.090> one<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.420> them

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it said no because neither one of them

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.460 
it said no because neither one of them
was<00:02:33.810> true<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.610> make<00:02:35.790> them<00:02:35.970> both<00:02:36.210> true

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.500 

it<00:02:40.470> said<00:02:40.800> no<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.520> both<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.820> them<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.270> true

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
it said no because both of them are true

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.870 
it said no because both of them are true
but<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.470> make<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.680> only<00:02:43.950> one<00:02:44.310> truth<00:02:44.640> then

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
but if we make it only one truth then

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.700 
but if we make it only one truth then
it's<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.390> work<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.470> only

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
it's going to work because this only

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's going to work because this only
works<00:02:47.040> when<00:02:47.250> either<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.880> them<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.300> true

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
works when either one of them is true

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.740 
works when either one of them is true
can't<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.260> both<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.950> can't<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.370> none<00:02:53.240> as<00:02:54.240> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
can't be both or it can't be none as you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.810 
can't be both or it can't be none as you
can<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.170> said<00:02:55.410> yes<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:55.860> only<00:02:56.460> one<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
can see it said yes because only one of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.730 
can see it said yes because only one of
them<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.150> true<00:02:59.810> okay<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.170> last<00:03:01.410> setting

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
them was true okay so the last setting

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.070 
them was true okay so the last setting
on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> logic<00:03:02.430> operations<00:03:03.240> walk<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.750> called

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
on the logic operations walk is called

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.360 
on the logic operations walk is called
not<00:03:04.640> well<00:03:05.640> not<00:03:05.880> does<00:03:06.210> is<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.840> asks<00:03:07.020> if<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.860> is

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
not well not does is it asks if a is

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.570 
not well not does is it asks if a is
false<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.280> false<00:03:11.690> then<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.050> says<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:14.220> it

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
false if a is false then it says that it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.390 
false if a is false then it says that it
sends<00:03:14.820> out<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.060> signal<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.780> says<00:03:15.840> true<00:03:16.410> if<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
sends out a signal that says true if a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.550 
sends out a signal that says true if a
is<00:03:17.460> true<00:03:17.760> sends<00:03:18.390> out<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> signal<00:03:18.750> that's<00:03:19.200> false

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
is true sends out a signal that's false

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.360 
is true sends out a signal that's false
so<00:03:19.920> let's<00:03:20.880> test<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:22.560> should<00:03:22.830> say<00:03:23.100> true

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
so let's test this this should say true

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.060 
so let's test this this should say true
as<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.790> guys<00:03:26.970> hear<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.540> said<00:03:27.750> yes<00:03:28.050> because<00:03:28.290> it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
as you guys hear it said yes because it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.610 
as you guys hear it said yes because it
was<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.550> was<00:03:29.910> set<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.270> false<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.990> if<00:03:31.050> we<00:03:31.230> changed

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
was a was set is false so if we changed

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.500 
was a was set is false so if we changed
it<00:03:31.709> over<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.130> true<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.640> not<00:03:32.760> going<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.330> work

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it over to true it's not going to work

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.650 
it over to true it's not going to work
because<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.430> false<00:03:38.360> thank<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.480> for

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
because a is it false thank you for

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.470 
because a is it false thank you for
