00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.760
 follow tube today we are outside yes 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.349
 We also do that more often a day 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.250
 the good gentleman must also still 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.250
 be housebroken 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.510
 round liver sausage 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.750
 when I'm outside I have to pee 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.180
 and also has to make a picture 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.590
 He is then always praised by art 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.480
 I think people are crazy 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.059
 possible out there and him 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.820
 fired like hell if he somehow 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.769
 just a business that's my story 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.260
 We actually sing pretty well 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.090
 the leash meantime i had to do this 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.180
 rope 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.270
 recently spontaneously because he his 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.789
 actually leashed your own leash 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:11.740
 has we were bitten at the hairdresser 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.420
 but on his thin thread 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 I thought oh come switch to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.850
 then was with the vet on 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.039
 Saturday another dog works and he has 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 pulled so hard that the leash just 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.310
 there had to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 we see he's running but people are running 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.560
 That's not always like that 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:43.939
 that is also the last taboo so blatant 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.689
 turned and all this he was the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.880
 was hell 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.350
 he did not want to go out, he bets 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.939
 Then the sentences are just gone 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.500
 look at our luck nothing him 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.810
 then stop to use a bit 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.659
 not too hard but I do 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.740
 I have to somehow and that is still 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.909
 a big problem 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:09.039
 often everything is inventing 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.039
 underneath it went really well 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.220
 teddy 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.590
