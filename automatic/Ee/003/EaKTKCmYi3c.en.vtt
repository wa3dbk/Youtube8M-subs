beautiful summer so I found this little

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
beautiful summer so I found this little
activity<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.000> choir<00:00:33.420> warm<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.170> book<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
activity in our choir warm up a book and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
activity in our choir warm up a book and
I<00:00:35.010> thought<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> would<00:00:35.520> share<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> few<00:00:36.239> different

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I thought I would share a few different

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
I thought I would share a few different
ways<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.140> could<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
ways you could do it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.060 
ways you could do it
now<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> original<00:00:39.149> activity<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.960> more<00:00:40.500> it's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
now the original activity is more it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.130 
now the original activity is more it's
cold<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> goes<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.440 

so<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.200> can<00:00:51.590> of<00:00:51.710> course<00:00:52.010> use<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.400> same<00:00:52.790> idea

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
so you can of course use the same idea

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.440 
so you can of course use the same idea
and<00:00:53.720> do<00:00:54.050> some<00:00:54.290> alternative<00:00:54.980> versions<00:00:55.450> what

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
and do some alternative versions what

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:05.720 
and do some alternative versions what
about<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:57.230> one

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:15.060 

this<00:01:12.780> backing<00:01:13.780> track<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.650> can<00:01:14.770> use<00:01:14.950> this

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
this backing track so you can use this

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070
