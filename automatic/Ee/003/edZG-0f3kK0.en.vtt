00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
anything special here and I'm actually

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.950 
anything special here and I'm actually
starting<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.250> way<00:02:50.810> when<00:02:51.810> we

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
starting to like it that way when we

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.390 
starting to like it that way when we
start<00:02:52.230> getting<00:02:52.350> hackers<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.250> I'm

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
start getting hackers again I'm

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.530 
start getting hackers again I'm
definitely<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.090> switch<00:02:54.270> back<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
definitely going to switch back to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.710 
definitely going to switch back to
hacking<00:02:55.110> because<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.850> horrible<00:02:57.420> guys

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
hacking because it's just horrible guys

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.400 
hacking because it's just horrible guys
because<00:02:58.170> when<00:02:58.920> one<00:02:59.280> every<00:02:59.490> year<00:02:59.520> I<00:03:00.200> guess<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
because when one every year I guess the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.590 
because when one every year I guess the
reason<00:03:01.560> why<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> started<00:03:02.130> hacking<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.820> because

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
reason why I started hacking is because

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.710 
reason why I started hacking is because
I<00:03:03.720> got<00:03:03.900> really<00:03:04.170> tired<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.650> hackers<00:03:05.040> themselves

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
I got really tired of hackers themselves

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.530 
I got really tired of hackers themselves
so<00:03:06.720> I'm<00:03:07.710> not<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.580> be<00:03:08.730> keeping<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.180> legit

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so I'm not going to be keeping it legit

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.680 
so I'm not going to be keeping it legit
for<00:03:09.720> long<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.770> want<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.550> really<00:03:12.030> wish

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
for long I really want to I really wish

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.750 
for long I really want to I really wish
there<00:03:12.930> wasn't<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.530> way<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.740> hack<00:03:14.100> except<00:03:14.730> for

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
there wasn't a way to hack except for

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.180 
there wasn't a way to hack except for
credible<00:03:15.240> missiles<00:03:15.660> by<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> way<00:03:16.110> which<00:03:16.920> by

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
credible missiles by the way which by

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.070 
credible missiles by the way which by
the<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.370> right<00:03:17.670> now<00:03:17.700> isn't<00:03:18.120> hacking<00:03:19.490> but<00:03:20.490> I

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
the way right now isn't hacking but I

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.020 
the way right now isn't hacking but I
really<00:03:22.080> wish<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.920> there<00:03:23.250> wasn't<00:03:23.490> any<00:03:23.790> way<00:03:24.000> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
really wish that there wasn't any way to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.820 
really wish that there wasn't any way to
hack<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.750> people<00:03:24.990> would<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.500> stop

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
hack and that people would just stop

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.850 
hack and that people would just stop
hacking<00:03:26.300> after<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.450> patch<00:03:27.690> because<00:03:28.380> i'm

it<00:04:14.660> ended<00:04:15.660> up<00:04:15.810> ending<00:04:16.290> because<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.010> score

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
it ended up ending because the score

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.729

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.750 
definitely not going to die and it was
it<00:04:27.410> was<00:04:27.470> guaranteed<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.220> was<00:04:28.370> going<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.550> get<00:04:28.670> him

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
it was guaranteed I was going to get him

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.880 
it was guaranteed I was going to get him
on<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.930> know<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.470> works<00:04:30.650> like<00:04:30.830> that

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
on but you know it works like that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
what's going on here is the predator

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.500 
what's going on here is the predator
missile<00:04:54.230> was<00:04:54.620> something<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.760> part<00:04:56.090> of<00:04:56.150> a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
missile was something in a part of a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.940 
missile was something in a part of a
class<00:04:57.080> mod<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:58.400> class<00:04:58.700> mod<00:04:59.120> was

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
class mod and the class mod was

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.710 
class mod and the class mod was
basically<00:05:01.390> how<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:02.419> say<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:04.730> stayed<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:05.390> it

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
basically how you say it it stayed on it

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.420 
basically how you say it it stayed on it
was<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:05.960> an<00:05:06.080> infection<00:05:06.410> except<00:05:07.070> for<00:05:07.250> when

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
was like an infection except for when

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.190 
was like an infection except for when
you<00:05:07.580> reboot<00:05:07.910> your<00:05:07.970> we<00:05:08.270> was<00:05:08.780> still<00:05:09.020> there

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
you reboot your we was still there

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.409 
you reboot your we was still there
because<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:10.040> modified<00:05:10.490> your<00:05:10.700> classes<00:05:11.270> it

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
because it modified your classes it

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.650 
because it modified your classes it
changed<00:05:11.810> your<00:05:11.960> classes<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.520> when<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.820> set<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.540> up

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
changed your classes so when I set it up

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.540 
changed your classes so when I set it up
and<00:05:14.870> rewired<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.620> reworked<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.370> and

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
and rewired and reworked it and

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.150 
and rewired and reworked it and
everything<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.900> was<00:05:18.200> fine<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.770> it<00:05:18.950> was

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
everything it was fine and it was

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.080 
everything it was fine and it was
working<00:05:19.669> so<00:05:20.360> i<00:05:20.810> can<00:05:21.380> go<00:05:21.620> on<00:05:21.830> normal<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.520> i<00:05:22.910> will

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
working so i can go on normal and i will

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.810 
working so i can go on normal and i will
have<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.450> on<00:05:23.630> i<00:05:23.870> love<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.560> I'm<00:05:24.710> psyched<00:05:25.520> for

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
have that on i love it I'm psyched for

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.680 
have that on i love it I'm psyched for
it<00:05:25.940> because<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:27.650> means<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.070> I<00:05:28.610> don't<00:05:29.540> have

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
it because that means that I don't have

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.140 
it because that means that I don't have
to<00:05:29.870> hack<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:31.370> hack<00:05:31.580> won't<00:05:31.760> work<00:05:31.880> for

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
to hack and the hack won't work for

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.570 
to hack and the hack won't work for
anybody<00:05:32.330> else<00:05:32.690> now<00:05:32.960> unless<00:05:33.919> they<00:05:34.160> used<00:05:34.400> it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
anybody else now unless they used it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.140 
anybody else now unless they used it
before<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.970> patch<00:05:35.150> like<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:35.570> did<00:05:35.780> but<00:05:36.470> um<00:05:37.150> the
