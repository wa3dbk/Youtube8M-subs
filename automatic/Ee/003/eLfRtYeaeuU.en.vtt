00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.820 

okay<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> idea<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> strumming<00:01:07.560> now

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
if I were to alternate pick through that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
if I were to alternate pick through that
it<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.050> be<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> same<00:01:10.260> exact<00:01:10.920> concept<00:01:11.460> but

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it would be the same exact concept but

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.630 
it would be the same exact concept but
now<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.000> picking<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

way<00:02:05.099> and<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.030> let's<00:02:06.239> pick<00:02:06.420> through<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
way and so let's pick through that the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.779 
way and so let's pick through that the
first<00:02:07.530> thing<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:08.190> us<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> work<00:02:08.459> on

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
first thing that I want us to work on

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309 
first thing that I want us to work on
though<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.299> if<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:09.989> having<00:02:10.170> trouble

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
though is that if you're having trouble

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.800 
though is that if you're having trouble
with<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.769> alternate<00:02:11.340> picking<00:02:11.519> ok<00:02:12.329> what<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
with your alternate picking ok what you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.479 
with your alternate picking ok what you
want<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.049> do<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.440> constantly<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.280> to

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
want to do is you constantly want to

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.449 
want to do is you constantly want to
work<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.790> your<00:02:15.030> speed<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.980> your<00:02:17.130> metronome

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
work on your speed so get your metronome

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.539 
work on your speed so get your metronome
ok<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.870> let's<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.500> our<00:02:19.530> metronome<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.280> here

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
ok so let's see our metronome right here

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.360 
ok so let's see our metronome right here
ok<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.569> take<00:02:22.019> your<00:02:22.140> mushroom<00:02:22.560> set<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.250> at<00:02:23.340> a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
ok so take your mushroom set it at a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.050 
ok so take your mushroom set it at a
slow<00:02:23.700> tempo<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> let's<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.819> 100<00:02:26.819> beats<00:02:26.940> per

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
slow tempo so let's do a 100 beats per

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.559 
slow tempo so let's do a 100 beats per
minute<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.260> bop<00:02:28.890> bop<00:02:29.190> bop<00:02:29.489> bop<00:02:29.730> maybe<00:02:30.360> that's<00:02:30.480> a

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
minute so bop bop bop bop maybe that's a

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.789 
minute so bop bop bop bop maybe that's a
little<00:02:30.599> bit<00:02:30.810> too<00:02:30.900> fast<00:02:31.170> maybe<00:02:31.500> we'll<00:02:31.680> go

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
little bit too fast maybe we'll go

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.190 
little bit too fast maybe we'll go
slower<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:32.340> 90<00:02:32.819> beats<00:02:33.000> per<00:02:33.120> minute<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.930> bop

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
slower like 90 beats per minute so bop

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.449 
slower like 90 beats per minute so bop
bop<00:02:34.440> bop<00:02:34.709> bop<00:02:35.010> bop<00:02:35.370> bop<00:02:35.670> bop<00:02:36.000> bop<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.459> just

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
bop bop bop bop bop bop bop and just

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.629 
bop bop bop bop bop bop bop and just
work<00:02:38.639> on<00:02:38.819> down<00:02:39.389> up<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:39.750> up<00:02:40.350> down<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:40.980> down<00:02:41.069> up

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
work on down up down up down up down up

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.240 
work on down up down up down up down up
down<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.359> down<00:02:42.450> up<00:02:43.019> now<00:02:43.319> with<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.280> um<00:02:46.250> when

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
down up down up now with this um when

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.410 
down up down up now with this um when
you're<00:02:47.400> gonna<00:02:47.519> play<00:02:47.790> let's<00:02:48.750> say<00:02:49.079> that<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:51.180> do

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
you're gonna play let's say that you do

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.690 
you're gonna play let's say that you do
your<00:02:51.569> C<00:02:51.780> chord<00:02:52.049> first<00:02:52.319> ok<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.620> now<00:02:52.829> we<00:02:52.889> have<00:02:53.160> C<00:02:53.489> F

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
your C chord first ok so now we have C F

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:06.390 
your C chord first ok so now we have C F
and<00:02:53.880> G<00:02:54.090> so

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.190 

okay<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.790> that's<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> idea<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.689> when<00:03:09.079> your

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
okay so that's the idea of when your

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080 
okay so that's the idea of when your
alternate<00:03:09.620> picking<00:03:09.829> now<00:03:10.129> what<00:03:10.400> would<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.730> do

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
alternate picking now what would you do

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.899 
alternate picking now what would you do
is<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.840> start<00:03:11.900> slow<00:03:12.500> with<00:03:12.829> your<00:03:13.250> metronome<00:03:13.579> and

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
is to start slow with your metronome and

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.750 
is to start slow with your metronome and
then<00:03:14.239> worked<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.719> to<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> higher<00:03:15.530> tempo<00:03:16.069> make<00:03:16.609> up

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
then worked up to a higher tempo make up

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.429 
then worked up to a higher tempo make up
your<00:03:16.879> own<00:03:16.939> chords<00:03:17.480> make<00:03:17.689> up<00:03:17.810> your<00:03:17.930> own<00:03:17.989> song

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
your own chords make up your own song

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.140 
your own chords make up your own song
have<00:03:19.010> fun<00:03:19.310> with<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.639> make<00:03:19.819> up<00:03:19.939> your<00:03:20.060> own

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
have fun with it make up your own

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.420 
have fun with it make up your own
pattern<00:03:20.629> the<00:03:20.750> idea<00:03:21.109> is<00:03:21.409> that<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.950> can<00:03:22.189> have<00:03:22.400> a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
pattern the idea is that you can have a

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.759 
pattern the idea is that you can have a
simple<00:03:22.849> pattern<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.510> your<00:03:24.109> alternate<00:03:24.530> picking

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
simple pattern on your alternate picking

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.309 
simple pattern on your alternate picking
a<00:03:25.180> technique<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.659> let's<00:03:26.900> say<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.230> was

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
a technique so let's say that it was

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.869 
a technique so let's say that it was
just<00:03:27.469> something<00:03:27.650> simple<00:03:27.889> like<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.370> okay

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
just something simple like this okay

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.440 
just something simple like this okay
let's<00:03:29.359> say<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.689> was<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:30.409> string<00:03:31.280> D<00:03:31.639> string<00:03:32.060> G

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
let's say it was a a string D string G

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.920 
let's say it was a a string D string G
and<00:03:32.859> then<00:03:33.859> back<00:03:34.310> down<00:03:34.340> again<00:03:34.579> so<00:03:35.239> let's<00:03:35.569> say<00:03:35.659> it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
and then back down again so let's say it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.569 
and then back down again so let's say it
was<00:03:36.049> this<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.620> whole<00:03:36.739> time<00:03:36.769> let<00:03:37.280> me<00:03:37.340> move<00:03:37.430> this

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
was this the whole time let me move this

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.909 
was this the whole time let me move this
up<00:03:37.760> okay<00:03:38.419> let's<00:03:38.689> say<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.989> was<00:03:39.079> this<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.769> whole

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
up okay let's say it was this the whole

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:47.259 
up okay let's say it was this the whole
time<00:03:39.950> okay<00:03:40.909> um<00:03:41.150> let's<00:03:42.109> save<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:45.909> okay<00:03:46.909> so

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
time okay um let's save this okay so
