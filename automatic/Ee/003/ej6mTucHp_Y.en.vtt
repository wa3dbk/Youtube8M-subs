00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
12 something that's what it looks like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440 
12 something that's what it looks like

wouldn't be a Miss I wouldn't blame you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
wouldn't be a Miss I wouldn't blame you
if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.830> were<00:02:02.310> predicting<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.940> 12<00:02:03.210> hatch<00:02:03.450> into

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
if you were predicting a 12 hatch into

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.810 
if you were predicting a 12 hatch into
pool<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.410> um<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.910> would<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.180> been<00:02:06.240> wrong

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
pool but um you would have been wrong

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.250 
pool but um you would have been wrong
never<00:02:08.820> mind<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.510> he's<00:02:09.630> going<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:09.960> very<00:02:10.200> very

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
never mind so he's going for a very very

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.950 
never mind so he's going for a very very
very<00:02:10.470> quick<00:02:10.800> tech<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.880> probably<00:02:12.720> he

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
very quick tech here probably he

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.240 
very quick tech here probably he
probably<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.590> get<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:13.890> he's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
probably is going to get a lot he's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.560 
probably is going to get a lot he's
obviously<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> second<00:02:15.180> hatchery

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
obviously going to get a second hatchery

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.520 
obviously going to get a second hatchery
before<00:02:16.440> too<00:02:16.620> long<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.270> then<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
before too long and then it's going to

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
before too long and then it's going to
probably<00:02:19.830> take<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.490> layer<00:02:20.730> very<00:02:20.970> quickly

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
probably take to layer very quickly

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.640 
probably take to layer very quickly
after<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.900> what's<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.350> happen

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
after that is what's going to happen

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.430 
after that is what's going to happen
here<00:02:23.690> SCV<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.960> come<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.320> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
here SCV is going to come in here and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.200 
here SCV is going to come in here and
spot<00:02:25.860> exactly<00:02:26.340> what's<00:02:26.460> going<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.790> sees<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
spot exactly what's going on sees the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.540 
spot exactly what's going on sees the
late<00:02:27.330> hatchery<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.190> run<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> there

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
late hatchery it's going to run in there

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.980 
late hatchery it's going to run in there
and<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.880> their<00:02:30.000> early<00:02:30.270> pool<00:02:30.540> he's<00:02:30.750> gonna<00:02:30.840> have

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and see their early pool he's gonna have

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.860 
and see their early pool he's gonna have
his<00:02:31.020> org<00:02:31.260> wings<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.560> before<00:02:31.860> too<00:02:32.040> long<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
his org wings out before too long and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.060 
his org wings out before too long and
probably<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.080> go<00:02:34.140> layer<00:02:34.350> first<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:34.830> not

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
probably going to go layer first I'm not

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.070 
probably going to go layer first I'm not
sure<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.310> he's<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.960> invest<00:02:36.960> in

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
sure if he's going to invest in

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320 
sure if he's going to invest in
zerglings<00:02:37.530> he<00:02:37.680> doesn't<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.310> well<00:02:39.120> no

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
zerglings he doesn't really have well no

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.250 
zerglings he doesn't really have well no
he's<00:02:39.480> probably<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.960> invest<00:02:40.200> in

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
he's probably not going to invest in

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.660 
he's probably not going to invest in
servings<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.830> economy<00:02:41.310> isn't<00:02:41.460> that

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
servings so this economy isn't that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.910 
servings so this economy isn't that
great<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.870> he's<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.680> some

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
great so it he's going to get some

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.290 
great so it he's going to get some
zerglings<00:02:44.340> obviously<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:44.940> he's<00:02:45.030> not<00:02:45.120> going

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
zerglings obviously but he's not going

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.930 
zerglings obviously but he's not going
to<00:02:45.330> be<00:02:45.450> able<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> ton<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.670> again<00:02:47.670> one

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
to be able to get a ton and again one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.060 
to be able to get a ton and again one

racks into CC for specials what it looks

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.390 
racks into CC for specials what it looks

producing<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.910> marine<00:02:54.180> what<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.050> going<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.320> here

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
producing a marine what is going on here

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.350 
producing a marine what is going on here
especially<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.430> scouted<00:02:56.820> an<00:02:56.970> early

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
especially you just scouted an early

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.780 
especially you just scouted an early
spawning<00:02:57.690> pool<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.050> gas<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.709> you're<00:02:59.670> not

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
spawning pool with gas and you're not

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.900 
spawning pool with gas and you're not
making<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.239> marine

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
making a marine

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.830 
making a marine
um<00:03:03.130> should<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.160> make<00:03:04.460> some<00:03:04.640> rains<00:03:04.880> buddy<00:03:05.180> okay

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
um should I make some rains buddy okay

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.330 
um should I make some rains buddy okay
now<00:03:05.990> he's<00:03:06.110> making<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.440> marine<00:03:06.650> he<00:03:06.800> was<00:03:06.950> saved<00:03:07.160> up

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
now he's making a marine he was saved up

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.620 
now he's making a marine he was saved up
for<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.610> command<00:03:07.970> center<00:03:08.210> first<00:03:08.450> that's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
for that command center first that's

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.480 
for that command center first that's
really<00:03:08.990> kind<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.470> mean<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.070> looks<00:03:10.190> like<00:03:10.370> he's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
really kind of I mean it looks like he's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
really kind of I mean it looks like he's
gonna<00:03:10.610> be<00:03:10.730> able<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.910> pull<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.060> off<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:11.390> he's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
gonna be able to pull it off and he's

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.330 
gonna be able to pull it off and he's
got<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> SCV<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.320> base<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.680> he<00:03:12.710> can<00:03:13.160> see

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
got the SCV in the base so he can see

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
got the SCV in the base so he can see
exactly<00:03:13.610> how<00:03:13.820> many<00:03:13.880> zerglings<00:03:14.390> are<00:03:14.480> coming

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
exactly how many zerglings are coming

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.300 
exactly how many zerglings are coming
out<00:03:14.840> he'll<00:03:15.050> kind<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.350> able<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.560> predict<00:03:15.830> but

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
out he'll kind of be able to predict but

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.430 
out he'll kind of be able to predict but
he's<00:03:16.460> gonna<00:03:16.580> have<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.880> really<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.840> mean<00:03:18.380> he

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
he's gonna have to really I mean he

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.230 
he's gonna have to really I mean he
could<00:03:18.680> get<00:03:18.830> overrun<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.730> beginning<00:03:20.180> of

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
Marines it could be really really bad

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.830 
Marines it could be really really bad
especially<00:03:30.470> because<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.130> choke<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:32.060> really

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
especially because that choke is really

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.690 
especially because that choke is really
hard<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.170> hold<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.800> don't<00:03:33.920> have<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> ramp<00:03:34.490> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
hard to hold you don't have a ramp to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.210 
hard to hold you don't have a ramp to
hold<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.570> it's<00:03:36.050> just<00:03:36.320> that<00:03:36.440> choke<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.010> it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
hold so it's just that choke and it's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.540 
hold so it's just that choke and it's
it's<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.300> funny-shaped<00:03:38.780> choke<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:39.860> it's

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
it's a funny-shaped choke and so it's

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.860 
it's a funny-shaped choke and so it's
it's<00:03:40.850> hard<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.180> hold<00:03:41.270> especially<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.840> have

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
it's hard to hold especially if you have

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.150 
it's hard to hold especially if you have
that<00:03:42.170> command<00:03:42.500> center<00:03:42.680> there<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:42.920> he's<00:03:43.040> going

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
that command center there so he's going

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.890 
that command center there so he's going
to<00:03:43.250> build<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.460> bunker<00:03:43.670> kind<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.480> next<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
to build a bunker kind of next to the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.840 
to build a bunker kind of next to the
choke<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.230> also<00:03:45.650> try<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:45.920> defend<00:03:46.250> his

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
choke and also try to defend his

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.210 
choke and also try to defend his
expansion<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.810> luxury<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.740> really<00:03:49.100> just

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
expansion and luxury is really just

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.100 
expansion and luxury is really just
wasting<00:03:49.580> a<00:03:49.670> ton<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.880> time<00:03:50.150> here<00:03:50.390> killing<00:03:51.020> off

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
wasting a ton of time here killing off

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.800 
wasting a ton of time here killing off
the<00:03:51.140> SUV<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:51.830> see<00:03:52.190> why<00:03:52.460> now<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:53.420> see<00:03:53.630> why

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
the SUV and we see why now we see why

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.660 
the SUV and we see why now we see why
this<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.470> why<00:03:54.500> he's<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.010> intent<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.460> killing

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
this is why he's so intent on killing

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.190 
this is why he's so intent on killing
that<00:03:55.910> SCD<00:03:56.270> instead<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.630> making<00:03:56.840> an<00:03:56.930> attack

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
that SCD instead of making an attack

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.750 
that SCD instead of making an attack
even<00:03:57.440> though<00:03:57.590> his<00:03:57.710> Overlord<00:03:58.160> was<00:03:58.250> there<00:03:58.520> and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
even though his Overlord was there and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.060 
even though his Overlord was there and
saw<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.360> special<00:04:00.170> had<00:04:00.290> nothing<00:04:00.860> at<00:04:00.980> his

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
saw that special had nothing at his

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.470 
saw that special had nothing at his
front<00:04:01.250> door<00:04:01.370> he<00:04:01.670> could<00:04:01.820> have<00:04:01.910> easily<00:04:02.090> built

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
front door he could have easily built

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.220 
front door he could have easily built
810<00:04:03.350> zerglings<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.010> overrun<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.550> front<00:04:04.760> door

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
810 zerglings and overrun the front door

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.540 
810 zerglings and overrun the front door
but<00:04:06.230> he's<00:04:06.320> been<00:04:06.470> going<00:04:06.680> after<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:07.010> SCV

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
but he's been going after this SCV

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.810 
but he's been going after this SCV
instead<00:04:08.000> which<00:04:08.900> seemed<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:10.190> waste<00:04:10.610> of

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
instead which seemed like a waste of

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.340 
instead which seemed like a waste of
time<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> me<00:04:11.240> but<00:04:11.510> now<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:11.690> see<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.080> he's

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
time to me but now I see that he's

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.630 
time to me but now I see that he's
getting<00:04:12.530> his<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:13.250> hatch<00:04:13.580> lurker<00:04:15.010> he's<00:04:16.010> really

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
getting his to hatch lurker he's really

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.310 
getting his to hatch lurker he's really
he's<00:04:17.209> really<00:04:17.480> invested<00:04:17.870> in<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.169> if<00:04:18.230> you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
he's really invested in that and if you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320 
he's really invested in that and if you
guys<00:04:18.410> got<00:04:18.650> scouted<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.430> would<00:04:19.940> be<00:04:20.030> horrible

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
guys got scouted that would be horrible

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330 
guys got scouted that would be horrible
so<00:04:20.750> he<00:04:20.930> needs<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.380> spend<00:04:21.590> his<00:04:21.739> six<00:04:21.950> circlings

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
so he needs to spend his six circlings

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.550 
so he needs to spend his six circlings
making<00:04:23.120> sure<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.600> SUV<00:04:23.960> does<00:04:24.110> not<00:04:24.320> see

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
making sure that that SUV does not see

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.050 
making sure that that SUV does not see
what's<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:24.980> on<00:04:25.070> finally<00:04:25.430> he<00:04:25.580> does<00:04:25.730> kill<00:04:25.910> the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
what's going on finally he does kill the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.110 
what's going on finally he does kill the
SUV<00:04:26.450> but<00:04:27.440> more<00:04:27.650> importantly<00:04:28.010> he<00:04:28.160> had<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.460> eesh

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
SUV but more importantly he had it eesh

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.909 
SUV but more importantly he had it eesh
aced<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.690> out<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:30.050> his<00:04:30.140> base<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.380> lot<00:04:30.740> earlier

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
aced it out of his base a lot earlier

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.100 
aced it out of his base a lot earlier
than<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.790> he<00:04:32.150> was<00:04:32.270> safe<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.780> now<00:04:32.990> he's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
than that so he was safe and now he's

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.190 
than that so he was safe and now he's
got<00:04:33.230> zergling<00:04:33.680> speed<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.280> well<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:35.300> he<00:04:36.080> is

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
got zergling speed as well so he is

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.600 
got zergling speed as well so he is
really<00:04:36.500> really<00:04:36.710> going<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.040> have<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.220> ton<00:04:37.580> of

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900 
kind of a waste of comm SAT night scans

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.710 
kind of a waste of comm SAT night scans
the<00:07:22.110> main<00:07:22.320> as<00:07:22.530> well<00:07:23.120> to<00:07:24.120> see<00:07:24.150> what<00:07:24.389> other<00:07:24.510> stuff

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720

is going on he sees the spire pretty I
guess<00:07:27.090> that's<00:07:27.270> a<00:07:27.330> pretty<00:07:27.479> good<00:07:27.630> move<00:07:27.750> actually

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
guess that's a pretty good move actually

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.659 
guess that's a pretty good move actually
he<00:07:28.110> wants<00:07:28.320> to<00:07:28.380> make<00:07:28.500> sure<00:07:28.560> that<00:07:28.860> he's<00:07:29.550> not

switching to aspire and he needs to get
turrets<00:07:31.770> up<00:07:31.950> which<00:07:32.910> would<00:07:33.060> be<00:07:33.180> pretty

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
turrets up which would be pretty

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.800 
turrets up which would be pretty
important<00:07:33.930> but<00:07:34.080> I<00:07:34.200> but<00:07:34.830> wow<00:07:35.220> I<00:07:35.520> mean<00:07:35.700> that's<00:07:36.570> a

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570 
lot of he now has no scan if luxury ran

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.760 
lot of he now has no scan if luxury ran
in<00:07:39.720> right<00:07:39.840> now<00:07:39.990> with<00:07:40.020> those<00:07:40.289> lurkers<00:07:40.560> he<00:07:40.650> can

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770 
in right now with those lurkers he can

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.010 
in right now with those lurkers he can
do<00:07:40.830> a<00:07:40.860> lot<00:07:41.160> of<00:07:41.220> damage<00:07:41.550> going<00:07:42.419> with<00:07:42.630> the<00:07:42.720> links

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 
do a lot of damage going with the links

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.690 
do a lot of damage going with the links
first<00:07:43.260> to<00:07:43.440> take<00:07:43.590> the<00:07:43.710> hits<00:07:43.919> going<00:07:44.490> with<00:07:44.610> the

first to take the hits going with the

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.920 
first to take the hits going with the
lurkers<00:07:45.030> he'd<00:07:45.180> probably<00:07:45.389> kill<00:07:45.600> off<00:07:45.750> those

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:45.930 
lurkers he'd probably kill off those

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.540 
lurkers he'd probably kill off those
front<00:07:46.200> two<00:07:46.260> bunkers<00:07:46.650> right<00:07:46.830> now<00:07:46.979> if<00:07:47.160> he<00:07:47.250> wanted
