the various pieces of the computer the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.640 
the various pieces of the computer the
generate<00:00:14.969> heat<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.049> ones<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.379> we're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
generate heat are the ones that we're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.830 
generate heat are the ones that we're
going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.160> water<00:00:17.430> point<00:00:17.820> let<00:00:18.510> me<00:00:18.600> give<00:00:18.750> you

going to be water point let me give you

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.160 
going to be water point let me give you
a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.640> close-up<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.600> various<00:00:21.930> pieces

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
a little close-up of the various pieces

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
a little close-up of the various pieces
that<00:00:22.500> we're<00:00:22.619> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> water<00:00:23.100> cooling<00:00:23.460> so

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that we're going to be water cooling so

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.670 
that we're going to be water cooling so
as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:24.990> these<00:00:25.380> two

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
as you can see here we have these two

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.540 
as you can see here we have these two
very<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.220> large<00:00:26.810> CPU<00:00:27.810> heat<00:00:28.320> sinks<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.920> what

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
very very large CPU heat sinks and what

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.389 
very very large CPU heat sinks and what
they<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.570> monster

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
they do is they have these monster

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
they do is they have these monster
120-millimeter<00:00:32.399> fans<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.510> bottom<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
120-millimeter fans on the bottom of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.119 
120-millimeter fans on the bottom of
that<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> top<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.129> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that one and on the top of that one and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.920 
that one and on the top of that one and
they<00:00:38.250> basically<00:00:38.430> take<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.120> heat<00:00:39.360> that's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
they basically take the heat that's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.619 
they basically take the heat that's
generated<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.340> cpu<00:00:41.760> core<00:00:42.030> down<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> there

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
generated in the cpu core down in there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.500 
generated in the cpu core down in there
and<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:43.500> suck<00:00:44.129> all<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> heat<00:00:44.940> through<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and they suck all the heat through the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.990 
and they suck all the heat through the
the<00:00:46.020> copper<00:00:46.410> tubing<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> copper<00:00:47.160> pipes<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the copper tubing the copper pipes you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.869 
the copper tubing the copper pipes you
can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> copper<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.230> there

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
can see some of that copper over there

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.180 
can see some of that copper over there
there<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.410> through<00:00:52.649> these<00:00:52.829> fan

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there it is and I go through these fan

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.540 
there it is and I go through these fan
girls<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.149> air<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> fan<00:00:55.469> blows<00:00:56.160> all

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
girls and the air from the fan blows all

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
girls and the air from the fan blows all
the<00:00:56.579> air<00:00:56.910> through<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.539> that's<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the air through it and that's how it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.470 
the air through it and that's how it
cools<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.170> CPU<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> also<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
cools the the CPU now you can also see

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.469 
cools the the CPU now you can also see
some<00:01:03.510> fans<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.589> front<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> computer

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
some fans in the front of the computer

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.750 
some fans in the front of the computer
there<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.860> some<00:01:07.860> three<00:01:08.159> fans<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

have installed right now and replacing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.480 
have installed right now and replacing
the<00:01:44.960> heat<00:01:45.960> sink<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.560> comes<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.009> along

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the heat sink that comes with it along

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
the heat sink that comes with it along
with<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> big<00:01:47.939> fan<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> makes<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> lot<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
with the big fan that makes a lot of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.200 
with the big fan that makes a lot of
noise<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> taking<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.399> well<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
noise and taking that out as well and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
to go through all the various components

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
to go through all the various components
to<00:02:02.460> cool<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> machine<00:02:03.210> now<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> may<00:02:04.049> ask

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to cool the machine now you may ask

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.620 
to cool the machine now you may ask
yourself<00:02:04.320> why<00:02:04.590> would<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.040> want<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> put<00:02:05.630> water

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
yourself why would I want to put water

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779 
yourself why would I want to put water
next<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> computer<00:02:07.829> well<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> point<00:02:08.580> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
next to the computer well the point is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270 
next to the computer well the point is
that<00:02:08.929> water

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that water

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
that water
moves<00:02:11.430> heat<00:02:11.880> away<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.240> these<00:02:12.810> heat

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
moves heat away from these heat

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
moves heat away from these heat
generating<00:02:14.040> components<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.730> lot<00:02:14.970> more

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
generating components a lot more

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.540 
generating components a lot more
efficiently<00:02:15.660> than<00:02:15.959> these<00:02:16.680> devices<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
efficiently than these devices with the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.180 
efficiently than these devices with the
fans<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:19.050> also<00:02:19.200> makes<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.800> lot<00:02:19.920> quieter

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
fans and it also makes it a lot quieter

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.410 
fans and it also makes it a lot quieter
as<00:02:20.550> well<00:02:21.170> water<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> lot<00:02:22.470> more<00:02:22.620> efficient<00:02:23.160> at

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
as well water is a lot more efficient at

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.180 
as well water is a lot more efficient at
removing<00:02:24.420> heat<00:02:25.200> from<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> components<00:02:26.069> I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
removing heat from the components I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.449 
removing heat from the components I
think<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.580> probably<00:02:26.940> around<00:02:28.069> about<00:02:29.069> 30

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
think it's probably around about 30

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.210 
think it's probably around about 30
times<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:29.940> efficient<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.720> removing<00:02:31.220> heat

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
times more efficient at removing heat

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.610 
times more efficient at removing heat
away<00:02:32.520> from<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:32.940> components<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.470> also

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
away from these components and it also

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.400 
away from these components and it also
stores<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.310> more<00:02:35.550> heat<00:02:35.819> than<00:02:36.510> air<00:02:36.840> does<00:02:37.140> I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
stores a lot more heat than air does I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.699 
stores a lot more heat than air does I
think<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.040> about<00:02:38.190> four<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:38.550> five<00:02:38.700> times<00:02:39.120> more

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
think it's about four or five times more

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.240 
think it's about four or five times more
air<00:02:41.209> more<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.360> more<00:02:42.750> heat<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:44.040> water

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
air more what more heat in the water

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.340 
air more what more heat in the water
than<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> does<00:02:44.820> through<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> air<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.110> that's

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
than it does through the air so that's

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.229 
than it does through the air so that's
the<00:02:46.440> big<00:02:46.650> reason<00:02:46.709> why<00:02:47.070> I'm<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.120> be

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the big reason why I'm going to be

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.850 
the big reason why I'm going to be
putting<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> water<00:02:49.140> cooling<00:02:49.530> into<00:02:49.680> this

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
putting in water cooling into this

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.699 
putting in water cooling into this
computer<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.150> stick<00:02:51.540> around<00:02:51.570> for<00:02:52.170> upcoming

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
computer so stick around for upcoming

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.479 
computer so stick around for upcoming
videos<00:02:52.890> on<00:02:53.519> how<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.090> thing<00:02:54.300> progresses<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
videos on how this thing progresses and

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.600 
videos on how this thing progresses and
subscribe<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:57.000> I'll<00:02:57.209> see<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.450> soon
