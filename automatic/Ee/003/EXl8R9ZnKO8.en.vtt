00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 what is a hero you ask me I do not know if 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 have an answer for that but I think 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 that a hero is someone who sees beyond 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
 of the differences that respects the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 ways of thinking and it ensures that all 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 be respected many say that a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 Hero can not hate however small 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.289
 koala I tell you yes yes you can then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 he is still a living being that feels 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 after all the difference is in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 that despite that he knows how to do 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.700
 regardless of the situation right know 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.010
 forgive 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.590
 strong that are there is something of tender 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.560
 kindly and even childish in them 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.170
 are those who know how to smile even in 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.940
 more difficult situations giving 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.970
 Hope to all those around you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.820
 believe and feel before thinking have 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.950
 fears but do not let themselves be overcome by them 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.080
 the hero thinks it's not fair that some 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.720
 few that are economically powerful 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.790
 for their position do what they want with 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.400
 those who are poor and unprotected that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.620
 they are many and achieving that equality is 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.140
 the one that inspires his journey the hero 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.450
 many times he will be afflicted not only by 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.430
 the enemies of freedom but also 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.130
 even by those he seeks 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.560
 protect small koala discrimination 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.240
 the belief that one is superior to another is the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.860
 worst of the evils and the greatest 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.259
 weakness sample 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.149
 never fall into that because despite 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.340
 that we are different on the outside 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.760
 inside we all have and we carry the same 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.220
 blood even to someone like me 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.440
 can donate blood to a human being and his 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.410
 body will accept it so the end and the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.360
 out where the difference is me 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.360
 I have always been treated like an animal 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.330
 same as my entire race however 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.550
 many of us are more people already 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.350
 that from small we got used to 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.780
 that between us we are very 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.120
 different so we assimilate the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.540
 differences in an easy way because it's in 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.540
 our nature 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.100
 this little one a hero will always be 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 willing to give his life for those to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.740
 who protects in a disinterested way 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 the years will pass but always you 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.539
 I assure he will always be alive from some 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.030
 way in people many will hear 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.100
 their stories which will be told of 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.440
 parents to children inspire a whole 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.390
 new generation of heroes that keep 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.120
 forever live your will 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.520
 now small as you will grow like this the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.040
 decision of what your life will be yours 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.380
 and nothing else but whatever the way 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.390
 that you choose lives without selfishness and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.739
 defending always in what you already believe 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.739
 the people you want
