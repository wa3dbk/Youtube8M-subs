00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
pretty nice little wipe out ahead there

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.360 
pretty nice little wipe out ahead there
and<00:03:00.270> now<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> picture<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.890> some<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
and now I have a picture of some of the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.920 
and now I have a picture of some of the
fish<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.880> we<00:03:03.000> caught<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.420> actually<00:03:03.780> have

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
fish that we caught we actually have

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.660 
fish that we caught we actually have
fished<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.830> dock<00:03:05.190> they<00:03:05.400> had<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
fished like a little dock they had and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.190 
fished like a little dock they had and
we<00:03:05.730> got<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> ton<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.390> catfish<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:06.960> then

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
we got like a ton of catfish and then

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.100 
we got like a ton of catfish and then
after<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.280> call<00:03:09.000> them<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.270> out<00:03:09.480> within<00:03:09.810> like

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
after we call them all out within like

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.920 
after we call them all out within like
the<00:03:10.140> past<00:03:10.410> day<00:03:10.710> or<00:03:10.740> two<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:12.150> clean<00:03:12.630> them

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
the past day or two we like clean them

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.060 
the past day or two we like clean them
so<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.080> learned<00:03:13.230> how<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.530> clean<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.890> fish

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
so I learned how to like clean the fish

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.130 
so I learned how to like clean the fish
which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.520> weird<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:15.990> aim

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
which is pretty weird and then we aim

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.960 
which is pretty weird and then we aim
