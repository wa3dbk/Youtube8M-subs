i<00:01:10.799> knew<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.520> probably<00:01:11.700> gonna<00:01:11.880> work<00:01:12.119> this

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
i knew it would probably gonna work this

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.440

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
the same as last year but there may be a
few<00:01:36.119> changes<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> price

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
few changes you have put in the price

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.640 
few changes you have put in the price
like<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.970> 1.2<00:01:39.509> k<00:01:39.750> max<00:01:40.020> starting

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
like that so we go 1.2 k max starting

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
like that so we go 1.2 k max starting
that<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> general<00:01:41.729> price<00:01:42.060> crisis

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that is the general price crisis

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.770 
that is the general price crisis
generally<00:01:43.470> sell<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.920> at<00:01:44.070> em<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.750> we

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
generally sell them at em so if we

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
generally sell them at em so if we
actually<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.350> even<00:01:46.530> cheaper<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.070> can't

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
actually on to go even cheaper we can't

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.490 
actually on to go even cheaper we can't
800<00:01:47.880> coin<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.170> pick<00:01:49.409> your

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
800 coin and you just pick your

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.580 
800 coin and you just pick your
chemistry<00:01:49.860> style<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.439> they

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
chemistry style so we can go and they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.429 
chemistry style so we can go and they
start<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.490> no<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.689> ones<00:01:54.960> these<00:01:55.259> ones

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
start with no not these ones these ones

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.780 
start with no not these ones these ones
you<00:01:55.619> generally<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.610> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you generally have to go for more like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580 
you generally have to go for more like
shadow<00:01:57.060> catalyst<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.600> hunter<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
shadow catalyst and hunter you have to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310 
shadow catalyst and hunter you have to
put<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> high<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.219> price<00:01:59.579> range<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:01.049> we're

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
put a high up price range in but we're

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530 
put a high up price range in but we're
gonna<00:02:01.439> start<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> maestro

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
gonna start of with maybe a maestro

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.719 
gonna start of with maybe a maestro
power<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.259> we'll<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:05.130> cards<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
power and we'll see what cards on the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.850 
power and we'll see what cards on the
market<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.390> plays<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.649> wouldn't

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
market so plays like this I wouldn't

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.800 
market so plays like this I wouldn't
actually<00:02:08.009> buy<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.849> they<00:02:09.360> haven't<00:02:09.569> got

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
actually buy because they haven't got

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.290 
actually buy because they haven't got
that<00:02:09.840> many<00:02:10.140> paid<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> they<00:02:11.550> may<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.910> even<00:02:11.970> be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that many paid and they may not even be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.710 
that many paid and they may not even be
in<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.720> right<00:02:12.870> position

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
in the right position

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.210 
in the right position
with<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.900> chemistry<00:02:14.290> style<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.890> I've

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
with that chemistry style and I've

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.530 
with that chemistry style and I've
already<00:02:15.340> picked<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> couple<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.240> before

I'm going to use this method to about 25

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280 
I'm going to use this method to about 25
k<00:02:39.340> aware<00:02:40.060> I'm<00:02:40.150> gonna<00:02:40.300> release<00:02:40.510> another<00:02:40.660> method

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
k aware I'm gonna release another method

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.050 
k aware I'm gonna release another method
so<00:02:41.470> make<00:02:41.650> sure<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.800> look<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.910> it'll

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
so make sure to look out that and it'll

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.199 
so make sure to look out that and it'll
be<00:02:43.210> up<00:02:43.300> very<00:02:43.360> soon<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.710> got<00:02:44.860> oreo<00:02:45.220> up<00:02:45.310> 950

i list em up for a caso a really really

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.880 
i list em up for a caso a really really
easy<00:02:58.540> profit<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.260> way<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.410> found<00:02:59.650> these

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
easy profit and the way I found these

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460 
easy profit and the way I found these
would<00:03:00.520> literally<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> same<00:03:01.720> thing<00:03:01.990> you

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
would literally do the same thing you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.340 
would literally do the same thing you
put<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.920> price<00:03:03.220> range<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.730> 1,000<00:03:04.480> or<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:04.630> you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
put in a price range of 1,000 or so you

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.170 
put in a price range of 1,000 or so you
have<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.770> chemist<00:03:06.130> all<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.700> stop<00:03:07.030> that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
have the chemist all can you stop that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940 
have the chemist all can you stop that
you<00:03:07.240> want<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.420> use<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.740> I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
the market that much for example I'm

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.979 
the market that much for example I'm
