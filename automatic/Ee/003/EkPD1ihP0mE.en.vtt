00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the pieces you need to make one this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.360 
the pieces you need to make one this
being<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.009> important<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:34.370> right

being the most important it's a right
angle<00:00:35.660> iron<00:00:36.660> piece<00:00:37.440> thingy<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.579> don't<00:00:38.610> know<00:00:38.820> how

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
angle iron piece thingy I don't know how

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
angle iron piece thingy I don't know how
to<00:00:39.000> call<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.860> get<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.280> pretty<00:00:41.489> much

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
to call it you can get it in pretty much

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
to call it you can get it in pretty much
any<00:00:41.910> hardware<00:00:42.329> store<00:00:42.480> around<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> world<00:00:43.969> for

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
any hardware store around the world for

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.020 
any hardware store around the world for
about<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.210> nano<00:00:45.660> 25<00:00:46.110> cents<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.590> something

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
about a nano 25 cents or something

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.990 
about a nano 25 cents or something
really<00:00:48.030> cheap<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.309> thing<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.760> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
really cheap and a good thing about this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.979 
really cheap and a good thing about this
is<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.699> modify<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> use<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is you don't have to modify it to use it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
is you don't have to modify it to use it
as<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> grinding<00:00:55.500> Jake<00:00:55.739> only<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> might

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
as a grinding Jake only thing you might

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.270 
as a grinding Jake only thing you might
have<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.320> drill<00:00:58.559> those<00:00:58.770> holes<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
have to do is to drill those holes a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.869 
have to do is to drill those holes a
little<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.579> bigger<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.989> come<00:01:01.410> but

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
little bit bigger then they come but

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.719 
little bit bigger then they come but
depends<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.180> screws<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.600> got<00:01:04.939> yeah<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
depends on what screws you got yeah so

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
depends on what screws you got yeah so
in<00:01:08.729> order<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> angle<00:01:12.470> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
in order to make up for the angle you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.170 
in order to make up for the angle you
have<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> lift<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.030> side<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> ground<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
have to lift this side of the ground you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.679 
have to lift this side of the ground you
could<00:01:18.180> actually<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> math<00:01:19.759> um<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
could actually do the math um with the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.550 
could actually do the math um with the
law<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.439> cosines<00:01:23.570> how<00:01:24.570> high<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> lift

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
law of cosines how high you have to lift

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
law of cosines how high you have to lift
this<00:01:25.860> side<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.549> order<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> achieve<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this side up in order to achieve a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.530 
this side up in order to achieve a
certain<00:01:28.770> angle<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> mean

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
certain angle on this side but I mean

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.469 
certain angle on this side but I mean
you<00:01:33.540> could<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.490> butt<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you could also just use the butt of a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.800 
you could also just use the butt of a
bolt<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> washer<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.150> call<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> day

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bolt and a washer and just call it a day

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.679 
bolt and a washer and just call it a day
don't<00:01:40.290> make<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.009> any<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.280> difficult<00:01:41.479> than<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
don't make it any more difficult than it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.399 
don't make it any more difficult than it
has<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:44.329> yeah<00:01:45.329> nobody<00:01:45.899> really

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:57.200 
has to be because yeah nobody really
cares<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:48.229> exact<00:01:49.229> angle<00:01:49.770> your<00:01:49.979> knife<00:01:50.159> has

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
that's a grinding Jake only thing left

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.020 
that's a grinding Jake only thing left
to<00:02:02.470> do<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.970> put<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.750> knife<00:02:04.930> on<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.310> goes<00:02:06.760> on

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
to do is to put your knife on it goes on

and<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.690> can<00:03:17.870> start<00:03:18.170> grinding<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.280> I'll<00:03:19.370> show

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
and you can start grinding and I'll show

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.180 
and you can start grinding and I'll show
you<00:03:19.580> how<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.420> done<00:03:21.010> in<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.070> second<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:24.830> okay

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
you how it's done in a second so okay

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.190 
you how it's done in a second so okay
now<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:25.640> we<00:03:25.670> are<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> modify<00:03:27.170> my

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
now here we are I have to modify my

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.650 
now here we are I have to modify my
grinder<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> little<00:03:28.250> bit<00:03:28.400> so<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.150> built<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
grinder a little bit so I built this

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.110 
grinder a little bit so I built this
grinding<00:03:30.050> table<00:03:30.440> in<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.800> butter<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.400> work

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
grinding table in the butter to work

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.260 
grinding table in the butter to work
with<00:03:32.420> my<00:03:32.930> running<00:03:33.320> jig

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
with my running jig

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.220 
with my running jig
yeah<00:03:35.270> set<00:03:36.080> pieces<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.560> scrap<00:03:36.740> wood<00:03:37.270> easy<00:03:38.270> you

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
yeah set pieces of scrap wood easy you

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.370 
yeah set pieces of scrap wood easy you
could<00:03:39.380> do<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.530> better<00:03:39.740> job<00:03:39.830> than<00:03:40.160> than<00:03:40.550> me<00:03:41.380> no

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
could do a better job than than me no

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.760 
could do a better job than than me no
problem<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.440> now<00:03:45.620> how<00:03:45.830> do<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.010> use<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:48.730> um<00:03:50.770> of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
problem so now how do you use it um of

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.720 
problem so now how do you use it um of
course<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.500> principle<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.650> you're<00:03:55.100> moving<00:03:55.370> of

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
course the principle is you're moving of

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.830 
course the principle is you're moving of
light<00:03:56.080> along<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:58.340> grinding<00:03:58.700> belt<00:03:58.910> but<00:03:59.510> you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
light along the grinding belt but you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.310 
light along the grinding belt but you
are<00:04:00.650> not<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.190> use<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.760> moving<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.600> up

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
are not just use the moving it up

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.570 
are not just use the moving it up
parallel<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:05.240> today<00:04:06.140> grinder<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.430> you're

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
parallel to the today grinder so you're

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.370 
parallel to the today grinder so you're
not<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:07.910> doing<00:04:08.090> this<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:11.390> are<00:04:11.420> also<00:04:11.900> at<00:04:12.350> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
not just doing this you are also at the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.570 
not just doing this you are also at the
same<00:04:12.710> time<00:04:13.210> tilting<00:04:14.210> it<00:04:14.360> in<00:04:14.780> words<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:16.370> more

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
same time tilting it in words the more

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.330 
same time tilting it in words the more
you<00:04:16.700> get<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.150> tip<00:04:17.360> so<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.080> looks<00:04:18.290> like<00:04:18.380> this

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
you get to the tip so it looks like this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.700 
you get to the tip so it looks like this
your<00:04:19.970> grinding<00:04:20.330> motion<00:04:20.480> looks<00:04:20.840> like<00:04:21.020> this

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.920 

this<00:04:24.710> is<00:04:24.860> first<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:27.470> your<00:04:27.650> grind

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
this is first that you that your grind

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.280 
this is first that you that your grind
evenly<00:04:29.930> on<00:04:30.760> this<00:04:31.760> side<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.240> well<00:04:32.900> as<00:04:33.050> on<00:04:33.080> the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
evenly on this side as well as on the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.830 
evenly on this side as well as on the
tip<00:04:34.330> should<00:04:35.330> only<00:04:35.600> do<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.900> like<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:37.810> well<00:04:38.810> I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
tip should only do it like this well I

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.650 
tip should only do it like this well I
don't<00:04:39.080> know<00:04:39.200> how<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.500> looks<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.950> would<00:04:40.640> look<00:04:40.820> but

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
don't know how it looks I would look but

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.730 
don't know how it looks I would look but
it<00:04:41.750> looks<00:04:42.010> not<00:04:43.010> like<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.250> normal<00:04:43.490> grind<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.740> you

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
it looks not like a normal grind so you

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.550 
it looks not like a normal grind so you
are<00:04:46.240> running<00:04:47.240> like<00:04:47.450> this<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:47.990> tilting

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
are running like this and then tilting

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.580 
are running like this and then tilting
it<00:04:48.680> outwards<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:51.200> works<00:04:51.580> really<00:04:52.580> good<00:04:53.590> to

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
it outwards this works really good to

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.030 
it outwards this works really good to
grind<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.980> other<00:04:55.130> side<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.410> mean<00:04:57.680> this<00:04:57.830> side

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
grind the other side so I mean this side

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.000 
grind the other side so I mean this side
now<00:04:58.880> this<00:04:59.360> side

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
now this side

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.880 
now this side
you<00:05:01.010> always<00:05:01.220> leave<00:05:01.640> just<00:05:02.090> open<00:05:03.080> those<00:05:03.260> low

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
you always leave just open those low

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.820 
you always leave just open those low
screws<00:05:04.300> turn<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.480> blade<00:05:05.690> around<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.590> same

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
screws turn the blade around the same

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:49.490 
screws turn the blade around the same
thing<00:05:07.130> on<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.460> side

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.930 

okay<00:05:50.500> now<00:05:50.680> if<00:05:50.860> something<00:05:51.070> like<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.520> happens

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
okay now if something like this happens

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.680 
okay now if something like this happens
well<00:05:52.840> this<00:05:53.470> just<00:05:53.740> means<00:05:54.240> that<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.420> have<00:05:55.570> to

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
well this just means that you have to

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.990 
well this just means that you have to
grind<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.020> little<00:05:56.050> bit<00:05:56.320> more<00:05:56.850> on<00:05:57.850> this<00:05:58.690> position

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
grind a little bit more on this position

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.540 
grind a little bit more on this position
Allanon<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:02.020> grind<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:02.470> really<00:06:03.310> really

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
Allanon that the grind is really really

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.780 
Allanon that the grind is really really
even<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.150> like<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:05.100> yeah<00:06:06.100> it's<00:06:06.550> really

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790

even I like it and yeah it's really
simple<00:06:07.620> so<00:06:08.620> I've<00:06:09.190> been<00:06:09.430> writing<00:06:09.700> for<00:06:09.820> about<00:06:10.150> 15

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
simple so I've been writing for about 15
