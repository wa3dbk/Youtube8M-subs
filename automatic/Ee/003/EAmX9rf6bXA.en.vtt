00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.209
 moin moin and welcome to one 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.639
 little tutorial we with shadow play of 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.230
 nvidia geforce experience was own 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.300
 gameplays could look quite different 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.890
 without spending money for the whole if 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.180
 you have a nvidia card to the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.890
 graphics card then the whole is free 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.510
 and you can do that through the program 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.190
 make geforce experience 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.690
 watch this program and now once 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.550
 this is now for surface 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.960
 Here you see the games he plays 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.190
 So automatically knows the players you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.169
 can also optimize for it 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.929
 but does not recognize me yet 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.579
 all games so then we have here too 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.070
 the whole update that means he is 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.570
 check in regularly in the current year 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.890
 current drivers if any 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 available are you the current ones 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.069
 then you see you have water again 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.530
 etc so everything can be installed which things 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.780
 we are on and then we come to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.219
 the attitudes so now have 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.920
 different attitudes about that 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.479
 program itself and here again 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.170
 you choose how often in just rappelz 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.899
 should check 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.729
 and then comes to shadow play and t-pay 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.289
 is the tool with her players on 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.339
 and could draw here so 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.710
 that means when you hear that 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.270
 then activated in the game, so to speak 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 the whole thing turned on and we can 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.100
 easily record on the cutter with 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.630
 60 fps and in mp4 format there we come 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.789
 let 's see what problems in that again 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.530
 and then you can choose if he wants 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.570
 should either record normally that is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.310
 every button opens or lets it go 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.939
 in the background almost without recording 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.469
 run with 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.439
 that means you can choose that 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.969
 last 20 minutes later 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.070
 should be saved that a whole 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.869
 practical matter of course the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.189
 quality and audio that means we can 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.770
 either say the game or with 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.750
 microphone or simply no sound 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.850
 You can also choose how 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.079
 also with fraps in which corner into this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.270
 icon should appear then too 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.729
 a small symbol of course where you are 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.640
 whole store volt in which drive 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.130
 and yes the keys to record 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.689
 you prove yourself then me too 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 have two pictures for you the first so 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.240
 looks the whole if you do not 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.590
 Recording presses the recording button 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.149
 then a green dot appears in 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.560
 the middle and if you then the recording 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.450
 wanted to save then you see that 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 the whole thing stored on the hard disk 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.859
 will look next where the whole 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.990
 in game how it looks then 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.590
 above I have the fps display 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.610
 from fraps because I have the whole 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.310
 at the same time that means cello play 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.380
 and rapeseed 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.450
 and since that is both f9 on the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 Recording button takes on the and 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 will look like the same again 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.190
 files looks that is us 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.310
 compare the whole thing so that is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.810
 here is of course assassin's creed 4 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.880
 black flag I have that right now 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.080
 only played through I have to say there 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.300
 is synonymous again a video to one 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 testvideo can already say it in advance 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.880
 is not really on assassin's anymore 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.510
 but creed as an independent game 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.310
 really good that means above 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.590
 I now have a little less frames because 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.180
 I really use both programs now 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.110
 record and focus on one very much on the same 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.030
 save disk 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 I have to say that I'm using shadow 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.830
 I want to play the whole thing less 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.140
 I have frame losses with raps 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.850
 have that means there is the framerate 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.860
 not so in the basement has no 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 display with cello play that is with 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.640
 raps he is always how much of frames 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.489
 you just have in the game you have unfortunately 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.900
 but otherwise he has hardly 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.209
 frame losses you can really do that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.650
 play very smoothly and I have too 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.170
 the impression that we see us too 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.209
 the same time that the recording of 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.920
 shadow player even such a tick 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.410
 looks better at the end because they are one 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.640
 little contrast worketh have 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.400
 I then again tell the two videos 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.650
 I have two files that he has now 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.519
 here once from shared but from fred and 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.959
 I think that's something else 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.489
 rich in contrasts I have none now 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.480
 color collection or put nothing 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.760
 is just the raw material now 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.870
 tricked down and actually that is from 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.250
 shots but really to 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.600
 Finally, we look at each other 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.220
 again in comparison the two files 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.230
 at the time of recording 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.850
 on the one hand, you already see fraps here 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.500
 you have an uncompressed avi file 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.470
 Accordingly, of course, takes a lot 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.319
 Lots of space 1 5gb cello play has one 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.850
 mp4 format and therefore only takes 700 mb 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.250
 what ever a lot of space 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.359
 then it is more economical on the hard disk 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.150
 Let's see the length here 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.260
 is different by one second yes 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.480
 raps takes 159 and 158 away 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.370
 Come to me where that comes from 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 so of course the data rate is the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.150
 operates is much higher in fraps 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.280
 because it is uncompressed at opel 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.790
 not and there we have it now 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.039
 already recorded 120 fps frames and at 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.840
 shadow play only 59 pictures per second like that 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.039
 audio is still a bit more though 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.560
 that does not matter in the end anyway 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.330
 because we will be the whole video then 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.870
 then merge then that is 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.990
 data rate not higher than 15 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.639
 20,000 so and cello play is increasing 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.350
 only with 9 50 pictures per second on and 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.190
 not at 60 as it stands there and man 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.470
 Unfortunately, none have yet 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.580
 selection options for shadow play 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.020
 itself that you can say I want 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 now in the resolution or with the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.590
 frame with record and that's it 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.570
 biggest problem in my opinion, because 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.550
 the longer the also advertises the 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.180
 duo synchronous will be the picture and afterwards 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.880
 also the sound 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.370
 I'll put that up a bit there 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.680
 almost the video editing program with 60 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.720
 fps works but 59 are present and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.740
 then he somehow shifts that way 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.880
 weird and I had that 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.070
 problem no longer the recording was 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.080
 to conclude that a green polo that 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.669
 that's my choice still the biggest 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.440
 weak point in the program otherwise 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.639
 was really highly recommended as it was 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.919
 Everyone can do it for free 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.690
 download for free is also with the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.880
 drivers included in the new 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.139
 nvidia drivers and I hope that like 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.889
 liked you and a little bit 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.900
 helped 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.410
 and then I want to say that until the next one 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.410
 I'm fine
