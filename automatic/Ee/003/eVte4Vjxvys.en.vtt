00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 they know me but who cares me 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.100
 I feel something strange or something that 'no 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 I also felt something that you give me 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.640
 and your body and my body 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.119
 it looks like it is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.119
 do not 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.330
 good weather 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.600
 but time and you take good in a little 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.600
 plus 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.439
 they sing to the rhythm of love 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250

 of love 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.930
 now we see no one can start two 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.010
 it is not the way to be 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.420
 we are like the flooring of taps 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.420
 thirsty for pleasure 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.430
 and from my life 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.430
 have been for this unit 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.090

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.860

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.510
 the soul 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.130
 a little more 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.630

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.600
 sentencing night they are first 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.040
 samba song now we hear the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.080
 opinion of our jury we are going to 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.210
 start with maricarmen marÃ­n that we have 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.470
 seen very concentrated and singing and 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:34.850
 Canary Islands the whole song well is very well 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.900
 we all know about all your work everything 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.140
 the work that he has been doing in 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.400
 all the past today it seems to me that 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.350
 physically in body movement 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.990
 we have been very good in the second 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.130
 part already warm I felt and a lot 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.840
 better than in the first one they had 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.480
 some detunements you have to have 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.320
 be careful with that in the zeta I think we 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.910
 pass 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.830
 that we need a little more accent 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.650
 just keep working and that 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.830
 thank you very much mari carmen forming 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.600
 the more we hear his opinion, 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.220
 they removed to you the qualification of 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.780
 doll the doll of the system 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.919
 creator to function that they put to the 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.919
 little doll is the little doll 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.700
 the doll we are not going to leave here 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.260
 so we still have to give the 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.470
 opinion man 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.420
 the amber with z and I do not know what for 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.670
 let people know that you are putting the 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.450
 Faith is well set as good 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.730
 from Madrid, good, my dear, effectively 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.950
 effectively first fearful part 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.300
 second part warmed up and you had better 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.730
 positioning not only in the 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.620
 take a chance move a little more 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.090
 missed a little movement missed 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.090
 move the hips as it is going to be the 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.890
 Accent path and there in the second part 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.500
 you put your voice better on the road very well 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.140
 thank you very much keep going 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.210
 then to listen to the opinion of the Lord 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.770
 surcharge now good the real Camilo 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.720
 Sesto is not characterized as the 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.070
 the most coordinated person in the world in that 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.180
 I feel that the invitation of the 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.180
 Body has been pretty good 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.870
 because it has not been a 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.110
 very coordinated interpretation 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.240
 but it looks a lot like that 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.980
 what I have to say that has not 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.110
 liked has been the vocal part about 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:20.220
 everything in the first half I think the 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:22.650
 movement has tempted a little and neither 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.180
 I fish more than a detune 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.150
 in the first half of the song the 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.350
 true and I still feel that the 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.480
 Spanish is not Spanish, it 's a mushroom 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.010
 once in a while and I do not feel the accent 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.230
 Spanish even then has also 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.570
 seemed a presentation only 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.650
 correct nothing very many thanks from 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.390
 jury 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.160
 I never leave what is going to sit down we go 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.160
 to a commercial cut as well
