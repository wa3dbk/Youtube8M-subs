in this shape you'll want your if you're

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
in this shape you'll want your if you're
doing<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> pattern<00:00:30.990> side<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.830> want<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
doing a pattern side you will want it to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.420 
doing a pattern side you will want it to
be<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> top<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.739> hold<00:00:35.010> under

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
be up at the top and then you hold under

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.959 
be up at the top and then you hold under
it<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.380> hold<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.969> under

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it was like this you just hold it under

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.889 
it was like this you just hold it under
to<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:41.700> looks<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> those

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to make it looks like one of those

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.130 
to make it looks like one of those
upside<00:00:43.350> down<00:00:43.500> awareness<00:00:44.100> ribbons<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
upside down awareness ribbons so you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
upside down awareness ribbons so you
start<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.520> pull

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
start there and then you want to pull

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.689 
start there and then you want to pull
this<00:00:50.760> bottom<00:00:51.390> part<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:52.440> I'm<00:00:53.219> gonna<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this bottom part up I'm gonna make it a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
this bottom part up I'm gonna make it a
little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> smaller<00:00:54.500> pull<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.620> little

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
little bit smaller pull this little

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
little bit smaller pull this little
bottom<00:00:56.489> part<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> makes<00:00:57.600> your

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bottom part up because that makes your

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.299 
bottom part up because that makes your
bottom<00:00:58.079> two<00:00:58.289> loops<00:01:00.410> you<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
bottom two loops you kind of have to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
bottom two loops you kind of have to
mess<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
mess with this to see how you like it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
mess with this to see how you like it
and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.909> you'll<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> clip<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.869> with

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and then you'll want to clip that with

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.450 
and then you'll want to clip that with
your<00:01:07.439> alligator<00:01:07.890> clip<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> hold<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.850> place

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
your alligator clip to hold it in place

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.020 
your alligator clip to hold it in place
and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.229> you'll<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.610> pull<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and then you'll have one one pull it a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.770 
and then you'll have one one pull it a
little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:17.240> don't<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.420> those<00:01:18.540> loops

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
little bit more I don't want those loops

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.260 
little bit more I don't want those loops
to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.049> too<00:01:19.320> big<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:20.400> that's<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> bottom<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to be too big now that's the bottom it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.410 
to be too big now that's the bottom it
looks<00:01:21.420> funny<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.580> okay<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.210> then

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
looks funny if they are okay and then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
looks funny if they are okay and then
you'll<00:01:24.600> pull<00:01:25.909> one<00:01:26.909> side<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:28.189> on<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> other

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you'll pull one side down on the other

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.249 
you'll pull one side down on the other
side<00:01:29.939> down<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:33.350> under<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.590> clip<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
side down you can under your clip and

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.510 
side down you can under your clip and
hold<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:39.979> might<00:01:40.979> need<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.369> make

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
hold on to it you might need to make

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.749 
hold on to it you might need to make
minor<00:01:42.000> adjustments<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:43.280> make<00:01:44.280> sure<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> your

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
minor adjustments to make sure that your

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.060 
minor adjustments to make sure that your
loops<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> take<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:47.909> thread

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
loops are even then you take your thread

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.039 
loops are even then you take your thread
it<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.220> also<00:01:50.549> possible<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> sew<00:01:51.270> these<00:01:51.509> bows<00:01:51.780> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it is also possible to sew these bows in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
it is also possible to sew these bows in
the<00:01:52.140> middle<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.950> put<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> few<00:01:53.399> stitches<00:01:53.909> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the middle just put a few stitches in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.899 
the middle just put a few stitches in
and<00:01:54.329> wrap<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.960> thread<00:01:55.320> around<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and wrap your thread around I just like

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.480 
and wrap your thread around I just like
to<00:01:57.090> wrap<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.450> thread

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
to wrap the thread

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.020 
to wrap the thread
it's<00:02:00.299> easier<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:02.460> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's easier for me to do it that way but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
it's easier for me to do it that way but
you<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.659> make<00:02:03.780> sure<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.430> bow

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you do have to make sure that your bow

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.919 
you do have to make sure that your bow
is<00:02:05.460> pinched<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.690> middle<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
is pinched right in the middle so that

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.110 
is pinched right in the middle so that
everything<00:02:10.009> pulls<00:02:11.009> together<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.760> want<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
everything pulls together so you want to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
everything pulls together so you want to
wrap<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.300> around<00:02:15.510> several<00:02:16.319> times<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.819> make<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
wrap it around several times to make it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.790 
wrap it around several times to make it
very<00:02:20.450> tight<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.819> like<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.900> wrap<00:02:28.050> mine<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> lot

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
very tight I like to wrap mine a lot

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.680 
very tight I like to wrap mine a lot
because<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.580> want<00:02:29.850> them<00:02:30.090> falling<00:02:30.270> apart

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
because I don't want them falling apart
