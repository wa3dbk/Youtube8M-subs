joinery<00:00:46.680> I've<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.160> switched<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
joinery I've all but switched to it I

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
joinery I've all but switched to it I
cut<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> slots<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> mortise<00:00:51.270> jig<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.840> both

parts<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.550> floating<00:00:54.000> tenon<00:00:54.329> stock

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
parts and use floating tenon stock

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.990 
parts and use floating tenon stock
I<00:00:55.610> really<00:00:56.610> believe<00:00:56.879> thats<00:00:57.120> faster<00:00:57.750> as

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
I really believe thats faster as

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.439 
I really believe thats faster as
accurate<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.359> possibly<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
accurate as you can possibly get and

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.649 
accurate as you can possibly get and
pretty<00:01:03.449> error-free<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.479> up

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
pretty error-free really and you make up

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
pretty error-free really and you make up
the<00:01:06.780> tenon<00:01:07.110> stock<00:01:07.229> round<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> corners<00:01:08.340> pull

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the tenon stock round the corners pull

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
the tenon stock round the corners pull
it<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.990> super<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> tests

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it in super good way to do it the tests

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
it in super good way to do it the tests
have<00:01:11.340> shown<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.030> stronger<00:01:12.390> stronger

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
have shown that it's a stronger stronger

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.700 
have shown that it's a stronger stronger
than<00:01:13.680> any<00:01:13.890> other<00:01:14.130> joint<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.500> to
