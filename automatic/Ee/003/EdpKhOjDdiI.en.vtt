00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
they're waiting to find out if they've

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:23.309 
they're waiting to find out if they've
been<00:06:13.370> good<00:06:13.670> but<00:06:13.880> good<00:06:14.180> kids<00:06:14.450> or<00:06:14.600> bad<00:06:14.780> kids

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.799 

I've<00:06:23.800> always<00:06:24.069> played<00:06:24.399> a<00:06:24.430> wide<00:06:25.149> array<00:06:25.779> of

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:25.809 
I've always played a wide array of

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:29.579 
I've always played a wide array of
Sabian<00:06:26.469> cymbals<00:06:26.949> and<00:06:27.249> I<00:06:27.999> love<00:06:28.389> them<00:06:28.569> all<00:06:28.749> but<00:06:29.050> I

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:29.589 
Sabian cymbals and I love them all but I

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.070 
Sabian cymbals and I love them all but I
guess<00:06:29.770> if<00:06:29.889> I<00:06:30.009> had<00:06:30.219> to<00:06:30.369> pick<00:06:30.580> one<00:06:31.059> Sabian<00:06:31.659> symbol

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
guess if I had to pick one Sabian symbol

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.989 
guess if I had to pick one Sabian symbol
that<00:06:32.229> I'm<00:06:32.379> obsessed<00:06:32.800> with<00:06:32.919> it<00:06:33.460> would<00:06:33.610> have<00:06:33.879> to

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:33.999 
that I'm obsessed with it would have to

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:36.540 
that I'm obsessed with it would have to
be<00:06:34.119> my<00:06:34.300> very<00:06:34.360> own<00:06:34.629> signature<00:06:35.499> symbol<00:06:36.159> the<00:06:36.309> max

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
be my very own signature symbol the max

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:44.330 
be my very own signature symbol the max
stacks

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.460 

this<00:06:44.730> is<00:06:44.880> the<00:06:45.000> Lomax<00:06:45.419> tax<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:46.050> twelve<00:06:46.320> and

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
this is the Lomax tax the twelve and

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.830 
this is the Lomax tax the twelve and
fourteen<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:47.310> it<00:06:47.520> comes<00:06:47.760> in<00:06:47.970> three<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.660> comes

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
fourteen and it comes in three it comes

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.500 
fourteen and it comes in three it comes
in<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.050> low<00:06:49.320> medium<00:06:49.470> and<00:06:49.740> high<00:06:49.880> but<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.910> would<00:06:51.180> say

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
in a low medium and high but I would say

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.360 
in a low medium and high but I would say
the<00:06:51.810> low<00:06:52.080> which<00:06:52.500> is<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.770> twelve<00:06:53.010> and<00:06:53.160> fourteen

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
the low which is the twelve and fourteen

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.890 
the low which is the twelve and fourteen
is<00:06:53.790> probably<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.840> one<00:06:55.190> that<00:06:56.190> I<00:06:56.639> utilize<00:06:57.600> in

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
is probably the one that I utilize in

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.260 
is probably the one that I utilize in
every<00:06:58.590> setting<00:06:59.010> I'm<00:06:59.220> playing<00:06:59.729> in<00:06:59.970> whether

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
every setting I'm playing in whether

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.260 
every setting I'm playing in whether
it's<00:07:00.660> you<00:07:01.440> know<00:07:01.470> a<00:07:01.590> progressive<00:07:02.340> band<00:07:02.580> or<00:07:03.240> a

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
it's you know a progressive band or a

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.840 
it's you know a progressive band or a
metal<00:07:03.750> band<00:07:03.990> it's<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.889> one<00:07:05.070> that<00:07:05.190> really<00:07:05.580> cuts

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:05.850 
metal band it's the one that really cuts

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.610 
metal band it's the one that really cuts
through<00:07:06.210> the<00:07:06.630> first<00:07:06.870> time<00:07:07.020> I<00:07:07.080> heard<00:07:07.260> stacked

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 
through the first time I heard stacked

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.000 
through the first time I heard stacked
symbols<00:07:08.040> was<00:07:08.280> was<00:07:08.550> from<00:07:09.000> Terry<00:07:09.210> Bozzio<00:07:09.419> and<00:07:10.010> at

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.010 
symbols was was from Terry Bozzio and at

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.219 
symbols was was from Terry Bozzio and at
the<00:07:11.250> time<00:07:11.460> that<00:07:11.610> I<00:07:11.669> developed<00:07:12.120> my<00:07:12.300> max<00:07:12.750> line

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
the time that I developed my max line

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.409 
the time that I developed my max line
with<00:07:13.500> Sabian<00:07:13.919> named<00:07:14.340> after<00:07:14.580> my<00:07:14.760> son<00:07:14.940> Max<00:07:15.180> by

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
with Sabian named after my son Max by

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.320 
with Sabian named after my son Max by
the<00:07:15.479> way<00:07:15.660> at<00:07:16.560> that<00:07:16.770> time<00:07:16.830> Terry<00:07:17.669> didn't<00:07:18.150> have

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
the way at that time Terry didn't have

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.270 
the way at that time Terry didn't have
the<00:07:18.540> radio<00:07:18.810> symbols<00:07:19.229> that<00:07:19.350> saving<00:07:19.740> the<00:07:19.800> offers

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
the radio symbols that saving the offers

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.300 
the radio symbols that saving the offers
so<00:07:20.550> I<00:07:20.580> wanted<00:07:20.970> to<00:07:21.060> develop<00:07:21.210> a<00:07:21.600> set<00:07:22.470> of<00:07:22.500> stacks

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
so I wanted to develop a set of stacks

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.600 
so I wanted to develop a set of stacks
of<00:07:23.639> my<00:07:23.910> own<00:07:24.090> and<00:07:24.710> in<00:07:25.710> addition<00:07:26.190> to<00:07:26.280> being<00:07:26.430> able

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
of my own and in addition to being able

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.310 
of my own and in addition to being able
to<00:07:26.729> ride<00:07:27.030> on<00:07:27.270> them<00:07:27.510> or<00:07:27.630> play<00:07:27.780> accents<00:07:28.200> with

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
to ride on them or play accents with

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.550 
to ride on them or play accents with
them<00:07:28.470> I<00:07:28.560> mean<00:07:28.710> those<00:07:29.460> kind<00:07:29.760> of<00:07:29.820> double<00:07:30.300> bass

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
them I mean those kind of double bass

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.350 
them I mean those kind of double bass
patterns<00:07:31.560> which<00:07:31.979> which<00:07:32.729> is<00:07:32.850> a<00:07:32.880> big<00:07:33.090> part<00:07:33.300> of

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
patterns which which is a big part of

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.510 
patterns which which is a big part of
Terry<00:07:33.630> style<00:07:34.050> and<00:07:34.380> it<00:07:34.530> has<00:07:34.740> become<00:07:35.130> a<00:07:35.160> big<00:07:35.370> part

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
Terry style and it has become a big part

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.460 
Terry style and it has become a big part
of<00:07:35.610> my<00:07:35.760> style<00:07:36.060> as<00:07:36.210> well<00:07:36.389> the<00:07:36.990> stacks<00:07:37.260> were

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
of my style as well the stacks were

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.320 
of my style as well the stacks were
great<00:07:37.710> for<00:07:37.919> that<00:07:38.039> and<00:07:38.250> I<00:07:38.370> have<00:07:38.580> three<00:07:38.940> sets<00:07:39.150> of

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
great for that and I have three sets of

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.060 
great for that and I have three sets of
stacks<00:07:39.600> on<00:07:39.780> my<00:07:39.900> kit<00:07:40.110> so<00:07:40.320> I<00:07:40.350> can<00:07:40.590> actually<00:07:40.770> do<00:07:41.039> a

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
stacks on my kit so I can actually do a

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.460 
stacks on my kit so I can actually do a
lot<00:07:41.250> of<00:07:41.430> double<00:07:42.120> handed<00:07:42.479> you<00:07:42.810> know<00:07:42.900> accents

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470 
lot of double handed you know accents

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.080 
lot of double handed you know accents
between<00:07:43.800> the<00:07:43.889> kick<00:07:44.070> drums<00:07:44.340> and<00:07:44.669> the<00:07:44.729> scenario

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.090 
between the kick drums and the scenario

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.580 
between the kick drums and the scenario
and<00:07:45.240> the<00:07:45.360> stacks

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.379 

and<00:07:49.770> I've<00:07:50.190> always<00:07:50.430> loved<00:07:50.639> stacked<00:07:50.970> symbols

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389 
and I've always loved stacked symbols

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.909 
and I've always loved stacked symbols
because<00:07:51.720> they're<00:07:51.960> they're<00:07:52.260> kind<00:07:52.530> of<00:07:52.680> the

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 
because they're they're kind of the
