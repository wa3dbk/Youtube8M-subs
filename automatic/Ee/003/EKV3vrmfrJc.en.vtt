00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.740
 m 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.430
 when we buy a new mobile phone 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.559
 we have only looked at many variables that 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.559
 if the processor that if the memory that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 If the brand offers us confidence and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 storage the price but also 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.760
 many times in the end we opted for one or 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.190
 another for something a little more intangible if 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.160
 we like it if the design is nice 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.610
 and we are convinced by the kazan company 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 presented is a tornado 348 focusing 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.809
 basically exclusively in this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.010
 in fact they have done what they present as 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.010
 the world's finest mobile 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.399
 if we usually start our 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.230
 analysis talking about design with more 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.329
 reason in this mobile you have in the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.070
 design your main point of sale is 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.809
 announces as the thinnest phone in the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.519
 world although since it came out has already 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.729
 there was some other that he has overcome with 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.170
 a thickness of 5 to 15 millimeters but 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.559
 maybe when you take it what's surprising 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.540
 it's the little thing that weighs 95 grams the weird 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.479
 that carrying not in your pocket sometimes 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.100
 between us that doubt the neura of that equal 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.750
 we have left it somewhere 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.850
 new we have with us in which 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.770
 it can be a small defect to be 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.539
 so light the mobile is so thin that almost 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 indicated the headphone jack of 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.960
 Indeed he has 5 than April 85 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.210
 millimeter is the phone that has 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.490
 overcome this kazan no longer incorporates that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.830
 connection because they do not fit the look 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.570
 mix the aluminum edges of the iphone 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.399
 6 and the glass back of the 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.770
 hesperia zetas and the use of these 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.530
 materials gives you a feeling of greater 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.420
 quality of what the truth costs is 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.100
 that if it happened to happen in the stores, 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.899
 I would be too surprised by a demand for 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.429
 Apple to copy them vilely that 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.890
 appeal these things has the trigger 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.300
 pretty easy and it seems enough 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.920
 to justify the truth 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.960
 On the other hand, the design is not original 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.370
 of kazan the British company patrick has 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 of having reached some kind of agreement 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.250
 because they use the same body as the mobile 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.590
 chinese lion and ips 5.1 although there's 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.300
 changing something the guts and the soto a 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.770
 curious thing and something uncomfortable is that the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 side buttons are on the left and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.650
 on the right with a lot of usual imagine 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.360
 that the hard ones will appreciate it and 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 surely flanders sell it their store 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 and even the three buttons of android 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.030
 which are capacitive and are not included 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.950
 on the screen they are upside down ie 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.030
 with the one to go back to the right 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.030
 then to the left that is normal 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.650
 with current technology such a mobile 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 thin and light should arrive some 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.090
 commitments as for example supports us 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.249
 4g screen is 4 8 inches 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.349
 a resolution of about 300 points for 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.239
 inch and it looks pretty good battery 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.459
 Suitable for a 4-inch screen 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.319
 and average but that is not so mobile is a 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.420
 bit fairer anyway while 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.400
 we dedicate ourselves to play all day 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.379
 real racing 3 other games that demand the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.299
 maximum power we will not have problem 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.680
 to get to the end of the day still the 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.299
 battery is not replaceable and it would not be 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 I miss that after using a couple of years already 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.560
 do not reach the end of the day the processor 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.209
 it's an 8 core mediatek it 's pretty 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.859
 powerful but not reaching figures of 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.930
 high range if it is above 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.480
 snapdragon 400 that are usually included in 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.120
 these low-end mobile phones have a 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.099
 giga de ram than with android 4.4 with 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.019
 the one that comes from being is enough but 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.669
 however, it only has 16 gigas of 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.859
 storage without the possibility of 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.299
 expand them via microsd card a 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.189
 section that surely results 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.260
 insufficient many users the camera 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.540
 is very normal 8 megapixels without 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.159
 optical stabilizer that pulls thomas out of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.189
 gendt is with light but without it does not give the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.189
 size 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.590
 the zamba decided to incorporate an android 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.240
 4.4 with very few modifications brings 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.890
 three extra applications pre-installed 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.300
 I really do not know how they do not come from 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.400
 factory with android sandinista or de 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.470
 internal files and recorder in addition 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.230
 also brings a video editor and rsc and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.210
 an application that allows the use of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.310
 Remote access to solve problems 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.260
 technicians can activate some 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 gestures like the classic pushbuttons in 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.320
 the screen to activate it and also 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.760
 allows unlock by using 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.190
 face recognition although the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.050
 own house does not recommend it in excess 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.610
 the notification center has also 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.320
 changed differentiating more 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.760
 notorious of the configurations adding 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.200
 some extra options like the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.120
 deactivate the auto rotation of the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.890
 screen or activate the call mode 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.390
 hidden that hides all the data 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.650
 personal in case we have to provide it 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.860
 someone to call and we do not trust 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.860
 much 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.170
 for about 270 euros the kazan tornado 348 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.330
 it's a bit expensive for the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.300
 features it offers but is that 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.040
 we are paying an extra for the design 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.340
 if you like his appearance and are willing 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.630
 to pay a little more for that is fine 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.160
 because the truth is that it offers a design 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.470
 worthy of a high-end what a 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.470
 remarkably lower price so if 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.660
 we like the design because we buy it and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.810
 yes no then we will not see each other in the next 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.810
 analysis
