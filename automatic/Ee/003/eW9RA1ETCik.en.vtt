yo right there just to blend it I took
that<00:02:20.459> same<00:02:20.760> fluid<00:02:21.000> line<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:21.629> then<00:02:22.110> start<00:02:22.379> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that same fluid line and then start it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
that same fluid line and then start it
at<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> tip<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.129> then<00:02:23.879> just<00:02:24.329> went<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.959> from

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
at the tip and then just went right from

at the tip and then just went right from
the<00:02:25.349> end<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.860> lashes<00:02:26.040> down<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.939> then<00:02:27.030> I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the end of the lashes down and then I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.610

glue on the back of my hand so I'm just
going<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.409> put<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.069> on<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:16.880> then

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
going to take it and put it on this then

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.760 
going to take it and put it on this then
I'll<00:04:18.030> stick<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.419> wherever<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:19.019> want<00:04:19.320> it

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.290 

and<00:04:22.770> then<00:04:23.130> figure<00:04:23.340> out<00:04:23.490> where<00:04:23.880> else<00:04:24.120> you're

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and then figure out where else you're

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.470 
and then figure out where else you're
going<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.510> want<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> place<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:27.150> I'm<00:04:27.300> gonna

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
going to want to place it and I'm gonna

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.570 
going to want to place it and I'm gonna
like<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.960> one<00:04:30.380> right<00:04:31.380> there<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.130> i'll<00:04:32.340> put<00:04:32.550> a

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
like this one right there so i'll put a

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.580 
like this one right there so i'll put a
little<00:04:32.820> glue<00:04:33.270> behind<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.930> then<00:04:34.860> i'll<00:04:35.070> stick<00:04:35.460> it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
little glue behind it then i'll stick it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.960 
little glue behind it then i'll stick it
now<00:04:37.590> just<00:04:37.800> hold<00:04:37.920> it<00:04:38.070> for<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.280> few<00:04:38.310> seconds<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:38.940> it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
now just hold it for a few seconds so it

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.830 
now just hold it for a few seconds so it
has<00:04:39.180> time<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.660> here<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:45.540> can<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.860> on

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
has time to it here you can see it's on

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.310 
has time to it here you can see it's on
and<00:04:48.920> so<00:04:49.920> you<00:04:50.010> just<00:04:50.250> keep<00:04:50.400> doing<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.990> for<00:04:51.990> all

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
and so you just keep doing that for all

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.440 
and so you just keep doing that for all
of<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.680> pieces<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.880> course<00:04:54.090> once<00:04:54.240> it's<00:04:54.360> on

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
of the pieces and of course once it's on

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.660 
of the pieces and of course once it's on
you<00:04:54.600> can<00:04:54.750> tweak<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.140> too<00:04:55.380> i<00:04:55.620> wanted<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.430> sit

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
you can tweak it too i wanted to sit

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.040 
you can tweak it too i wanted to sit
like<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.940> don't<00:04:57.000> like<00:04:57.240> how<00:04:57.390> long<00:04:57.570> that<00:04:57.780> one<00:04:57.930> is

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
like I don't like how long that one is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.370 
like I don't like how long that one is
and<00:04:58.350> since<00:04:58.620> it's<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:58.830> paper<00:04:59.660> and<00:05:00.660> break<00:05:01.230> it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
and since it's just paper and break it

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.880 
and since it's just paper and break it
see<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.600> keep<00:05:03.690> doing<00:05:03.930> that<00:05:04.080> just<00:05:04.740> keep

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
see so just keep doing that just keep

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.680 
see so just keep doing that just keep
placing<00:05:05.100> them<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.700> then<00:05:05.940> I'll<00:05:06.270> show<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.510> what

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
placing them and then I'll show you what

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:15.710 
placing them and then I'll show you what
to<00:05:06.840> do<00:05:06.960> after<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:14.090> okay<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.390> have

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
to do after that okay so I have

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.440 
to do after that okay so I have
everything<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.980> placed<00:05:17.310> where<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.760> want<00:05:18.330> it

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
everything on and placed where I want it

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.860 
everything on and placed where I want it
now<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:19.350> can<00:05:19.770> see<00:05:19.950> that<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.250> orange<00:05:20.850> kind<00:05:21.690> of

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
now you can see that the orange kind of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290 
now you can see that the orange kind of
stands<00:05:22.110> out<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.560> bit<00:05:22.920> much<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:23.790> on<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.120> side

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
stands out a bit much like on this side

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.270 
stands out a bit much like on this side
visit<00:05:24.690> st.<00:05:24.870> out<00:05:24.960> as<00:05:25.140> much<00:05:25.290> but<00:05:25.710> on<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:25.980> one<00:05:26.160> it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
visit st. out as much but on this one it

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.690 
visit st. out as much but on this one it
does<00:05:26.630> what<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.660> did<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.110> just<00:05:28.410> tell<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.680> that's<00:05:29.490> I

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.690 
does what I did I just tell you that's I
took<00:05:29.850> that<00:05:30.120> same<00:05:30.600> fluid<00:05:31.140> line<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.770> then<00:05:32.430> right

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
took that same fluid line and then right

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.160 
took that same fluid line and then right
here<00:05:32.730> where<00:05:33.270> everything<00:05:33.720> is<00:05:33.840> kind<00:05:34.020> of

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
here where everything is kind of

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.770 
here where everything is kind of
connected<00:05:35.150> just<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.270> make<00:05:36.420> it<00:05:36.450> so<00:05:36.660> you<00:05:36.750> don't

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
connected just to make it so you don't

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.050 
connected just to make it so you don't
see<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.410> bright<00:05:37.830> congestion<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.820> color

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
see like a bright congestion of color

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.800 
see like a bright congestion of color
right<00:05:39.330> there<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.840> just<00:05:40.650> painted<00:05:41.300> over<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
right there I just painted over the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.980 
right there I just painted over the
paper<00:05:43.730> with<00:05:44.730> the<00:05:44.850> fluid<00:05:45.120> line<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.660> kind<00:05:45.870> of

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
paper with the fluid line and kind of

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.660 
paper with the fluid line and kind of
just<00:05:46.170> fade<00:05:46.500> it<00:05:46.620> out<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:47.040> you<00:05:47.130> can<00:05:47.160> see<00:05:47.430> that's

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
just fade it out and you can see that's

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.360 
just fade it out and you can see that's
already<00:05:48.350> making<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.470> area<00:05:49.770> look<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.160> lot

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
already making that area look a lot

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:58.040 
already making that area look a lot
better<00:05:54.950> so<00:05:55.950> I<00:05:56.340> like<00:05:57.000> that<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.420> can<00:05:57.540> see<00:05:57.720> looks

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
better so I like that you can see looks

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.200 
better so I like that you can see looks
a<00:05:58.140> little<00:05:58.260> bit<00:05:58.410> better<00:05:58.670> but<00:05:59.670> I'm<00:05:59.790> going<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> do

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210

be incredible color that bright yellow
that's<00:06:04.560> shimmery<00:06:04.980> and<00:06:05.480> I'm<00:06:06.480> going<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.690> take<00:06:06.840> it

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
that's shimmery and I'm going to take it

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.070 
that's shimmery and I'm going to take it
on<00:06:07.170> just<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:08.010> 239<00:06:08.760> brush<00:06:09.090> which<00:06:09.420> is<00:06:09.570> just<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.840> flat

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
on just a 239 brush which is just a flat

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.500 
on just a 239 brush which is just a flat
one<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.470> then<00:06:11.190> in<00:06:11.400> between<00:06:13.850> areas<00:06:14.850> on<00:06:15.360> the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
one and then in between areas on the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.400 
one and then in between areas on the
paper<00:06:17.060> I'm<00:06:18.060> just<00:06:18.270> going<00:06:18.480> to<00:06:18.510> do<00:06:18.720> big<00:06:19.140> yellow

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
paper I'm just going to do big yellow

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.040 
paper I'm just going to do big yellow
splotches<00:06:19.980> like<00:06:20.310> that<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.760> then<00:06:21.510> just<00:06:21.540> like<00:06:21.930> I

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
splotches like that and then just like I

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.420 
splotches like that and then just like I
did<00:06:22.110> with<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:24.410> red<00:06:25.410> I'm<00:06:25.770> just<00:06:26.070> going<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.220> do

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
did with the red I'm just going to do

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:34.620 
did with the red I'm just going to do
flicks<00:06:27.200> to<00:06:28.200> blend<00:06:28.440> it<00:06:28.560> out

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.580 

so<00:06:35.630> you<00:06:35.720> can<00:06:35.840> see<00:06:35.990> it's<00:06:36.140> starting<00:06:36.230> to<00:06:36.470> add

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
so you can see it's starting to add

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:44.230
