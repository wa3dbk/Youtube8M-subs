00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.430
 Hello big mountain Today is video 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.040
 In the future , we will take the opportunity of building two basic map of building guide 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:26.439
 I would like to give you some basic information. 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:29.590
 Uh Sim City look at the official website every possible building construction in Siem actual 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:34.750
 I'd like to have a cell size in the bay 8m 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.870
 With this, you can now roughly estimate the size of the actual sims t map 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.630
 If you look at Park Tools 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:48.219
 Newark wood heat 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:52.899
 There is a small tree, but the length of this contribution is short 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:57.999
 Oh the short liver is 16 16 m in length 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:03.249
 Yes High millimeter distance includes two on both ends 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:05.210
 I've been working on this rate all the time. There are 124 parks in this area. 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.990
 It's possible 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.320
 124 surface 1984 m 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.100
 The roads constructed at both ends 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.630
 It's a bit like a park. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.720
 Hey, if the Swords Road eotdeun use what is called a multiple of 8 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.869
 I think it's up to 24m. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.950
 If you sum this road and the way of the park 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.340
 Air-core City Vevey area of horizontal 2032 m 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.630
 The new size will be 12m in 2003 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:44.020
 You're a peaceful people that count the space of about 125 million pyeong 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.020
 I looked at the actual map size with this . 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:56.510
 The society around Gangnam 2 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:01.420
 So once I saw how big the actual two key notes 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.420
 It's big, but it's small. 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.320
 Well that while the actual games build a city on a site of this size 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.320
 I think you can think. 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.790
 In my game I'm looking at the market 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.939
 Given that ranking can watch live and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:29.719
 The building is called the ward office. 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:34.189
 Ingeo country hit by the real Cameron Community Center Now that we are all part Commissioner markets 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:40.129
 But it could be a coincidence. 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:41.269
 The look is the size of the map that you can feel small compared to the previous one, SimCity . 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.799
 I see. 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.159
 In Roth City Five, the concept of wide area 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:53.540
 I do not think it's a good idea to build multiple cities . 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.590
 So, in this narrow space, how do you make your city more 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.970
 Will 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.859
 All buildings that can be constructed in Assium City 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.530
 Communicate information about effective deployment 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.669
 We caught the aim of this video 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:17.090
 The video I'm about to show is not normal. 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:20.659
 There is no sense in this, but the first time, 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.079
 I hope you can help a lot of users. 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:29.680
 Next time I'll tell you about the size of the residential and commercial building. 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.680
 Thank you
