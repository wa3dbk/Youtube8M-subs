00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.099
 like as good or u as wet and if 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.080
 you have to do the wet there is little to do 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 we Tuscans can tell you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 with clarity it has taken and the Sora 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 it also costs little because of the part 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 top of the cow is easily 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 recognizable by this line of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 bold as soon as inside but if 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.570
 you have chosen a good butcher and it is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 full the territory of good butchers gods 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.750
 good farms and you start doing 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 1 stew with this greenhouse and you do it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.690
 then soak in the damp that is there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 you are organized maybe with a nice one 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 sautÃ© of abundant gold onion 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.789
 maybe even mixing some shallots 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.969
 you have brought everything to the color of copper 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.340
 also towards the bronze is fine and then there 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.410
 go inside for the peeled tomato e 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 make it soothe after having the wave 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.140
 maybe in another saw me this piece 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 Sora the blue-blue-blue-blue floor plan 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.510
 blue for three hours this depends on 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.540
 quality of meat three and a half hours t4 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.180
 then let it cool all out, please 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 This is important to do can swallow 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.970
 the temperatures remove the meat well 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.520
 cold you do it in slices and the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.340
 put back in a pan and slice 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.680
 after slice getting it all dirty 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 greasy gravy from this moist 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.450
 cipolluzzo with leeks with shallots 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.659
 and then brought it back to temperature with 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.890
 a bain-marie the beautiful lively pan 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 and then the overcooked sora is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.950
 objectively one of the best things 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.020
 of the world 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 what ate us together, too 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 potato boiled a potato made to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.590
 cartoccio soiled with greasiness 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.960
 of the wet can become the most thing 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.420
 good of the world but also if you have fried 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 some potatoes stand out phones inside 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.200
 the damp that came out of that too 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 may be the best thing in the world 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.110
 a well whatever you want you can do 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.479
 also some potato gnocchi and serve them 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.729
 so in a plate, plates with eyes of 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.860
 potato and the slice of the stracotto e 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.490
 dirty both the stew and the Ioco 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.130
 with his 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.140
 I'm out there and you'll understand that being born 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.730
 Italian 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 sometimes it's an advantage sometimes 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 for heaven's sake, of course, no 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
 stockfish in your dull tank arezzo
