library so you got surf is one I've
currently<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.250> like

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
currently got on so see that's just like

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.319 
currently got on so see that's just like
a<00:01:29.400> tidal<00:01:29.670> wave

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
a tidal wave

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
a tidal wave
we've<00:01:30.659> appeared<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> background<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
we've appeared in the background and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
we've appeared in the background and
that's<00:01:32.909> quite<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> nice-looking<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that's quite a nice-looking one then you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
that's quite a nice-looking one then you
have<00:01:34.409> shark<00:01:34.829> which<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> shark<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> side

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
have shark which has a shark on the side

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.719 
have shark which has a shark on the side
and<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.350> bubbles<00:01:37.710> around<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.220> edges<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and some bubbles around the edges and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
and some bubbles around the edges and
some<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.060> seaweed<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.659> grass<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
some like seaweed kind of grass kind of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.660 
some like seaweed kind of grass kind of
stuff<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.159> logger

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
stuff then you have logger

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.990 
stuff then you have logger
which<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.840> log<00:01:43.320> obviously<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
which is a log obviously in the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.100 
which is a log obviously in the
background<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> guy<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> jet<00:01:45.869> ski<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
background the guy on a jet ski in the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
background the guy on a jet ski in the
back<00:01:46.290> plane<00:01:46.829> over<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> forest

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
back plane over there and like a forest

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
back plane over there and like a forest
behind<00:01:48.329> him<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.079> pretty<00:01:49.470> decent<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.890> nice

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
behind him that's pretty decent a nice

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
behind him that's pretty decent a nice
wood<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.170> back<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.439> quite<00:01:52.590> cool<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
wood kind of back that's quite cool the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
wood kind of back that's quite cool the
little<00:01:53.130> wooden<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
little wooden back and then you have

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.719 
little wooden back and then you have
this<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> octopus<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> giant

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this one the octopus there's a giant

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
this one the octopus there's a giant
octopus<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> side<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.770> van<00:01:58.920> again

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
octopus on the side of the van again

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.870 
octopus on the side of the van again
looking<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.240> good<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.990> changed<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
looking pretty good actually changed to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.209 
looking pretty good actually changed to
the<00:02:02.880> logger<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.320> I'm<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.409> gonna<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:05.009> for

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the logger one I'm not gonna go one for

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.340 
the logger one I'm not gonna go one for
now<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:06.030> we're<00:02:06.149> gonna<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.479> over<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.140> what

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
now and then we're gonna go over to what

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.180 
now and then we're gonna go over to what
I<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:07.469> coming<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.099> obviously

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
I was coming out so we can obviously

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
I was coming out so we can obviously
lower<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> suspension<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> usual

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
lower the suspension all the usual

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.900 
lower the suspension all the usual
performance<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.129> stuff<00:02:11.370> aesthetics

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
performance kind of stuff aesthetics

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.760 
performance kind of stuff aesthetics
wise<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.599> looks<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.290> only

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
wise it looks like you can only

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.060 
wise it looks like you can only
really<00:02:14.040> change<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:15.570> OSI<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> actual<00:02:16.740> paint

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
really change the OSI the actual paint

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.790 
really change the OSI the actual paint
job<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:18.000> actually<00:02:18.240> have<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> color<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
job you can actually have a color and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200 
job you can actually have a color and
you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.010> also<00:02:20.160> seem<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.490> change<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.000> wheels

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
you can also seem to change the wheels

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.340 
you can also seem to change the wheels
in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.480> window<00:02:21.720> suppose<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:21.990> can't<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
in the window suppose you can't in the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.070 
in the window suppose you can't in the
windows<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.120> change<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
windows like that and you can change the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.890 
windows like that and you can change the
wheels<00:02:26.210> obviously<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.360> any<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.780> wheels

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
wheels obviously to any kind of wheels

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
wheels obviously to any kind of wheels
you<00:02:28.050> want<00:02:28.350> let's<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.400> nice<00:02:29.550> like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
here the custom tires you get a little

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.140 
here the custom tires you get a little
tiny<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.590> written<00:02:52.710> on<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> side<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.460> mean<00:02:54.000> in
