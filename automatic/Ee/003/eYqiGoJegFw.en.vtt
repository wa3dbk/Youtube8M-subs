00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.929
 few meters of interest 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.740
 Sebastian in Worms 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.859

 Discounts his teammates far away 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.409

 Of course, we do not see anything like the iPad or any other picture 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.450
 then we have another thesis to say that I have these cute ones 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.690
 this would have the workers 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.700
