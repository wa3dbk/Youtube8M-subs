00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.340 

this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.800> last<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.610> forming<00:00:03.600> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
this is the last video on forming the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.769 
this is the last video on forming the
pond<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.210> basically<00:00:06.210> what<00:00:06.480> we're<00:00:06.600> going<00:00:06.720> to

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
pond and basically what we're going to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.070 
pond and basically what we're going to
form<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.740> circular<00:00:08.280> deck<00:00:09.050> and<00:00:10.050> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
form here is the circular deck and of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.120 
form here is the circular deck and of
course<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.679> need<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.099> sure

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
course we're going to need to make sure

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.030 
course we're going to need to make sure
that<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.759> thickened<00:00:12.179> up<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.480> lot<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.660> times

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
that it's thickened up a lot of times

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.890 
that it's thickened up a lot of times
you<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.610> least<00:00:14.670> four<00:00:15.330> inches

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
you want it to be at least four inches

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300 
you want it to be at least four inches
and<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> believe<00:00:16.379> that's<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:16.980> doing

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and I believe that's what we're doing

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.130 
and I believe that's what we're doing
here<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.609> four<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> half<00:00:18.359> inches<00:00:19.080> thick

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
here for four and a half inches thick

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
here for four and a half inches thick
and<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:21.060> course<00:00:21.270> then<00:00:21.539> you'll<00:00:21.689> need<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and of course then you'll need to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.070 
and of course then you'll need to
install<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.619> rebar<00:00:23.539> just<00:00:24.539> grab<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
install the rebar just grab a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.220 
install the rebar just grab a
straightedge<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> level<00:00:26.369> level<00:00:27.119> across<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
straightedge or a level level across to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.990 
straightedge or a level level across to
make<00:00:28.650> sure<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:30.619> decking<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
make sure that the decking is going to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
make sure that the decking is going to
be<00:00:33.120> flat<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.500> always

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
be flat and if you want you can always

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.850 
be flat and if you want you can always
slope<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.309> away<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.899> larger<00:00:37.350> decking

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
slope it away if it's a larger decking

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.639 
slope it away if it's a larger decking
it<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.579> slope<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.600> direction<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> where

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it can slope in a direction to where

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.740 
it can slope in a direction to where
it's<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> accumulate<00:00:41.640> water<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
it's not going to accumulate water this

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's not going to accumulate water this
particular<00:00:43.200> deck<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.489> only<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> be

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
particular deck is only going to be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
particular deck is only going to be
about<00:00:45.270> 18<00:00:45.840> inches<00:00:46.289> 20<00:00:46.590> inches<00:00:46.800> wide<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.730> I'm

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
about 18 inches 20 inches wide and I'm

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
about 18 inches 20 inches wide and I'm
going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.989> level<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.309> be

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
going to make it level it will be

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
going to make it level it will be
perfectly<00:00:51.030> flat<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.750> won't<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.350> big

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
perfectly flat it won't really be a big

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.290 
perfectly flat it won't really be a big
problem<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.480> water<00:00:55.140> accumulating<00:00:56.300> obviously

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
problem for water accumulating obviously

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
problem for water accumulating obviously
and<00:00:57.480> Plus<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> level<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and Plus that if it is level and you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
and Plus that if it is level and you
make<00:00:59.430> everything<00:00:59.460> flat<00:01:00.210> water<00:01:00.660> shouldn't

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
make everything flat water shouldn't

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
make everything flat water shouldn't
accumulate<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.010> anyway<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.820> should<00:01:03.059> drain

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
accumulate on it anyway it should drain

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
accumulate on it anyway it should drain
off<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.280> one<00:01:05.280> direction<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> other<00:01:07.159> what

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
off in one direction or the other what

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.300 
off in one direction or the other what
we<00:01:08.460> used<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.659> roller<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we used was a roller and when a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.289 
we used was a roller and when a
paintbrush<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.530> some<00:01:13.909> cooking<00:01:14.909> oil

paintbrush and some cooking oil
you've<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> coat<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.430> forms<00:01:18.210> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you've got to coat the forms with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.679 
you've got to coat the forms with
cooking<00:01:19.080> oil<00:01:19.409> otherwise<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.850> to

cooking oil otherwise you are going to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.340 
cooking oil otherwise you are going to
end<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.530> potholes<00:01:23.869> let<00:01:24.869> me<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.170> show

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
one of these potholes will look like as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
one of these potholes will look like as
you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> picture<00:01:32.640> there<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.270> a

you can see in this picture there is a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
you can see in this picture there is a
chunk<00:01:33.930> missing<00:01:34.290> from<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> upper

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
chunk missing from the kind of upper

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
chunk missing from the kind of upper
right<00:01:36.150> hand<00:01:36.180> section<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> picture<00:01:38.070> here

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
right hand section of the picture here

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.319 
right hand section of the picture here
it's<00:01:38.880> towards<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.950> right<00:01:40.950> below<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.670> rim<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's towards the right below the rim of

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's towards the right below the rim of
the<00:01:43.110> pond<00:01:43.770> two<00:01:44.070> decking<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> there's<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> good

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the pond two decking and there's a good

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.889 
the pond two decking and there's a good
chance<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:46.110> wasn't<00:01:46.680> enough<00:01:47.009> oil<00:01:47.600> yeah<00:01:48.600> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
chance there wasn't enough oil yeah on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.469 
chance there wasn't enough oil yeah on
the<00:01:49.380> wood<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.920> wasn't<00:01:50.280> coated<00:01:50.729> enough<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the wood it wasn't coated enough so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.910 
the wood it wasn't coated enough so
you've<00:01:51.600> got<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> make<00:01:52.049> sure<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> wood<00:01:52.890> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you've got to make sure that the wood is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 
you've got to make sure that the wood is
coated<00:01:53.640> sufficiently<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> by<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.350> don't

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
coated sufficiently and by that I don't

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.719 
coated sufficiently and by that I don't
care<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:55.950> even<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.610> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
care I don't even I don't think you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
care I don't even I don't think you
could<00:01:56.880> over<00:01:57.270> coat<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> put

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
could over coat this by the way you put

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.200 
could over coat this by the way you put
enough<00:01:59.579> oil<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.579> then<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> concrete's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
enough oil on there then the concrete's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
enough oil on there then the concrete's
just<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> stick<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.619> don't<00:02:04.829> put

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
just not going to stick you don't put

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
just not going to stick you don't put
enough<00:02:05.189> oil<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.299> you're<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.689> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
enough oil on there then you're going to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.150 
enough oil on there then you're going to
end<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.259> stuff<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
end up with stuff like that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.219 
end up with stuff like that
and<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> don't<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> fix<00:02:09.989> stuff

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and if you don't know how to fix stuff

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.160 
and if you don't know how to fix stuff
like<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.670> could<00:02:11.879> end<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.180> with<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
like that you really could end up with a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.760 
like that you really could end up with a
problem<00:02:14.450> while<00:02:15.450> you're<00:02:15.990> stripping<00:02:16.500> your

picture actually has the concrete pump
hose<00:02:29.190> there<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:30.360> used<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.690> concrete<00:02:31.110> pump<00:02:31.500> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
hose there we used a concrete pump to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.960 
hose there we used a concrete pump to
pump<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.060> concrete<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> back<00:02:34.310> now<00:02:35.310> don't

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
pump the concrete to the back now don't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.400 
pump the concrete to the back now don't
forget<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.380> a

forget if you are going to use a
concrete<00:02:37.680> pump<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:40.410> could<00:02:40.680> be

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
concrete pump that there could be

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.210 
concrete pump that there could be
charges<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.700> you're<00:02:42.030> more<00:02:43.019> than<00:02:43.290> 200<00:02:44.010> feet

charges if you're more than 200 feet
away<00:02:44.519> from<00:02:45.150> an<00:02:45.269> area<00:02:45.480> where<00:02:45.959> they<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.200> pump

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
away from an area where they can pump

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.890 
away from an area where they can pump
the<00:02:46.860> concrete<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.269> wouldn't<00:02:48.600> be<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> bad<00:02:48.870> idea

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the concrete so wouldn't be a bad idea

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.729 
the concrete so wouldn't be a bad idea
to<00:02:49.440> check<00:02:49.470> with<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.660> local<00:02:51.660> concrete<00:02:52.170> pumper<00:02:52.560> in

same<00:03:48.690> thing<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.109> concrete<00:03:49.410> pump<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.670> know

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
same thing with a concrete pump you know

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.370 
same thing with a concrete pump you know
now<00:03:51.329> there<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.530> more<00:03:52.799> thing<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.489> is

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
now there is one more thing that is

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.569 
now there is one more thing that is
crucial<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.380> really<00:03:58.799> don't<00:03:59.220> want<00:03:59.489> to

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
crucial and the you really don't want to

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.270 
crucial and the you really don't want to
have<00:03:59.760> a<00:04:00.030> real<00:04:00.359> wet<00:04:00.810> or<00:04:01.049> sloppy<00:04:01.620> mix<00:04:02.069> of

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
have a real wet or sloppy mix of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.539 
have a real wet or sloppy mix of
concrete<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:03.650> need<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:05.010> make<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
concrete and you need to make the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.229 
concrete and you need to make the
manufacturer<00:04:06.390> understand<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.670> can't<00:04:08.970> be

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239

too too wet or it's going to booze out
of<00:04:15.030> all<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.750> these<00:04:15.900> spots<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:17.519> know<00:04:17.700> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
of all of these spots you know and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.000 
of all of these spots you know and
actually<00:04:18.930> when<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.200> guy<00:04:19.350> brought<00:04:19.620> the

actually when the guy brought the

actually when the guy brought the
concrete<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.760> was<00:04:20.880> little<00:04:21.120> too<00:04:21.390> wet<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.840> had

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
concrete it was little too wet and I had

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:22.969 
concrete it was little too wet and I had
to<00:04:22.229> deal<00:04:22.470> with<00:04:22.680> it

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
to deal with it

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.520 
to deal with it
and<00:04:23.190> what<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.669> ended<00:04:24.090> up<00:04:24.240> with<00:04:24.300> was<00:04:25.430> poor

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
and what I ended up with was poor

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.100 
and what I ended up with was poor
bring<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> concrete<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.580> bottom<00:04:28.330> it'ld

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
bring the concrete on the bottom it'ld

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.340 
bring the concrete on the bottom it'ld
the<00:04:29.980> concrete<00:04:30.550> had<00:04:30.730> overfilled<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.930> bottom

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
the concrete had overfilled the bottom

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.430 
the concrete had overfilled the bottom
area<00:04:32.950> so<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> inside<00:04:34.000> circle<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.139> pond

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
area so the inside circle of the pond

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.150 
area so the inside circle of the pond
the<00:04:35.800> very<00:04:36.010> bottom<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.700> pond<00:04:37.320> is<00:04:38.320> about<00:04:38.919> an

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
the very bottom of the pond is about an

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.090 
the very bottom of the pond is about an
inch<00:04:39.460> higher<00:04:40.240> than<00:04:40.740> what<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.980> originally

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
inch higher than what it originally

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.980 
inch higher than what it originally
should<00:04:42.550> have<00:04:42.760> been<00:04:43.000> because<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.480> concrete

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
should have been because the concrete

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.300 
should have been because the concrete
was<00:04:44.139> so<00:04:44.440> wet<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:46.290> overflowed<00:04:47.290> into<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.919> area

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
was so wet it overflowed into that area

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.909 
was so wet it overflowed into that area
and<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.850> course<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.660> all<00:04:49.870> weight<00:04:50.139> as

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
and of course it's it's all weight as

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.590 
and of course it's it's all weight as
you're<00:04:51.190> pumping<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.639> other<00:04:51.790> concrete<00:04:52.360> into

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
you're pumping the other concrete into

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.540 
you're pumping the other concrete into
the<00:04:52.630> other<00:04:52.840> areas<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.680> wants<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.160> come<00:04:54.340> into

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
the other areas it wants to come into

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.650 
the other areas it wants to come into
these<00:04:54.760> areas<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.740> basic<00:04:57.639> science<00:04:57.910> so

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
these areas it's just basic science so

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.230 
these areas it's just basic science so
and<00:04:59.260> of<00:04:59.620> course<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.919> can't<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.400> too<00:05:00.669> dry<00:05:01.000> of

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
and of course you can't have too dry of

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.870 
and of course you can't have too dry of
a<00:05:01.360> mix<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:02.140> know<00:05:02.320> otherwise<00:05:02.890> you're<00:05:03.640> going<00:05:03.790> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
a mix you know otherwise you're going to

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.100 
a mix you know otherwise you're going to
have<00:05:04.060> problems<00:05:04.680> pouring<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:07.630> pond<00:05:07.900> I

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
have problems pouring the the pond I

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.510 
have problems pouring the the pond I
another<00:05:08.440> thing<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.860> could<00:05:09.070> use<00:05:09.310> as<00:05:09.490> a

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
another thing you could use as a

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.360 
another thing you could use as a
concrete<00:05:10.000> vibrator<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.780> didn't<00:05:11.410> use<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.890> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
concrete vibrator I didn't use it and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.490 
concrete vibrator I didn't use it and
obviously<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:13.150> didn't<00:05:13.480> need<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.990> didn't<00:05:14.320> you

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
obviously I didn't need it it didn't you

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.620 
obviously I didn't need it it didn't you
didn't<00:05:14.740> see<00:05:14.890> any<00:05:15.070> spots<00:05:15.700> there<00:05:16.090> but<00:05:16.330> if<00:05:16.480> this

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
didn't see any spots there but if this

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
didn't see any spots there but if this
was<00:05:16.810> something<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.930> feel<00:05:20.229> that<00:05:20.500> you

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
was something that you feel that you

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.920 
was something that you feel that you
might<00:05:20.860> need<00:05:21.190> then<00:05:21.669> go<00:05:22.090> for<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.450> with<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.630> pea

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
might need then go for it with a pea

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.050 
might need then go for it with a pea
gravel<00:05:23.229> mix<00:05:23.830> most<00:05:24.400> of<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.639> time<00:05:24.850> for

gravel mix most of the time for

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.550 
gravel mix most of the time for
something<00:05:25.240> like<00:05:25.389> this<00:05:25.750> you're<00:05:25.930> not<00:05:26.080> going<00:05:26.440> to

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
something like this you're not going to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.930 
something like this you're not going to
need<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.100> wasn't<00:05:27.340> really<00:05:27.550> worried

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
need it and I wasn't really worried

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.120 
need it and I wasn't really worried
about<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.510> again<00:05:28.930> these<00:05:29.560> are<00:05:29.620> questions

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
about it and again these are questions

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.890 
about it and again these are questions
you<00:05:30.190> could<00:05:30.430> ask<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:31.360> concrete<00:05:32.220> manufacturer

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
you could ask the concrete manufacturer

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.290 
you could ask the concrete manufacturer
about<00:05:34.900> or<00:05:35.260> even<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.830> local<00:05:36.190> contractor<00:05:36.910> in<00:05:37.120> your
