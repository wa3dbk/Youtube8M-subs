some<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.319> color<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.959> is<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> symbolic

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
some of that color so this is a symbolic

some of that color so this is a symbolic

spent 14 years promoting the beauty of
the<00:02:21.280> north<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.670> Scotland<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> painting

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the north of Scotland and the painting

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.570 
the north of Scotland and the painting
is<00:02:23.530> also<00:02:23.860> called<00:02:24.160> optimism<00:02:24.970> Scotland<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
is also called optimism Scotland and I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.390 
is also called optimism Scotland and I
think<00:02:27.580> reading<00:02:27.849> into<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.860> as

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
think reading into it like that as as as

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.229 
think reading into it like that as as as
taking<00:02:31.060> em<00:02:32.220> completely<00:02:33.220> at<00:02:33.940> face<00:02:34.209> value

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
taking em completely at face value

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.670 
taking em completely at face value
without<00:02:34.720> any<00:02:35.230> any<00:02:35.950> other<00:02:36.130> information<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:37.680> like

without any any other information I like

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.160 
without any any other information I like
the<00:02:38.800> idea<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.460> is<00:02:39.490> controversial<00:02:40.270> but

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
the idea that it is controversial but

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.600 
the idea that it is controversial but
like<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.500> idea<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.099> can<00:02:42.280> scratch

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
like the idea that you can scratch

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.930 
like the idea that you can scratch
beneath<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.240> surface<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.900> truly<00:02:44.319> understand

it's with a future that's uncertain and

it's with a future that's uncertain and

I think it's uncertain either way the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.180 
I think it's uncertain either way the

I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:46.030> at<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> moment<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.930> pulls<00:03:47.140> our

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
I think at the moment that pulls our

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.900 
I think at the moment that pulls our
stand<00:03:47.530> about<00:03:48.359> 47:53<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.660> favor<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:51.489> Union

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
stand about 47:53 in favor of the Union

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.090 
stand about 47:53 in favor of the Union
I<00:03:54.480> hesitate<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.510> say<00:03:56.380> what<00:03:56.620> I'll<00:03:56.769> be<00:03:56.950> voting

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
I hesitate to say what I'll be voting

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.640 
I hesitate to say what I'll be voting
but<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:59.100> think<00:04:00.690> optimism<00:04:01.690> can<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.019> described<00:04:02.470> in

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
but I think optimism can be described in

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.060 
but I think optimism can be described in
both<00:04:02.890> balls<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.239> no<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.920> camp

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
both balls with the no a camp

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.400 
both balls with the no a camp
we've<00:04:06.250> got<00:04:06.489> optimism<00:04:07.150> about<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:08.170> glasses

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
we've got optimism about it the glasses

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.890 
we've got optimism about it the glasses
are<00:04:08.769> filled<00:04:09.130> we're<00:04:09.430> quite<00:04:09.700> happy<00:04:09.730> with<00:04:10.660> what

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
are filled we're quite happy with what

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.710 
are filled we're quite happy with what
we<00:04:11.079> have<00:04:11.320> we<00:04:11.920> see<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> as<00:04:12.549> positive<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.329> we<00:04:13.450> see

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
we have we see it as positive and we see

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.599 
we have we see it as positive and we see
it<00:04:13.920> as<00:04:15.030> progressive<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.239> future<00:04:17.609> with

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
it as progressive for the future with

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.479 
it as progressive for the future with
the<00:04:18.760> yes<00:04:19.030> campaign<00:04:19.539> it<00:04:19.810> seems<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.890> be<00:04:20.979> more

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
the yes campaign it seems to be more

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
the yes campaign it seems to be more
obviously<00:04:22.180> about<00:04:22.450> optimistic<00:04:23.380> approach<00:04:23.710> that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
obviously about optimistic approach that

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.200 
obviously about optimistic approach that
we<00:04:24.220> can<00:04:24.400> make<00:04:24.640> it<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:25.060> an<00:04:25.720> independent<00:04:26.260> nation

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
we can make it as an independent nation

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.550 
we can make it as an independent nation
um<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.539> think<00:04:31.720> there's<00:04:32.140> positivity

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
um I think I I think there's positivity

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.490 
um I think I I think there's positivity
in<00:04:32.860> both<00:04:33.100> sides<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.789> the<00:04:34.240> more<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.870> think<00:04:35.169> about

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
in both sides and the more I think about

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.260 
in both sides and the more I think about
it<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.890> more<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.070> worry<00:04:36.460> about<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.880> they're<00:04:37.030> not

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
it the more I worry about it they're not

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.360 
it the more I worry about it they're not
being<00:04:37.600> positively<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.770> no<00:04:39.070> vote

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
being positively to you and no vote

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.640 
being positively to you and no vote
purely<00:04:40.060> because<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.810> debate<00:04:41.229> surrounding

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
purely because of the debate surrounding

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.400 
purely because of the debate surrounding
it<00:04:42.400> um<00:04:43.680> damaging<00:04:44.680> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
it um damaging the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.430 
it um damaging the
the<00:04:45.680> union<00:04:47.530> either<00:04:48.530> way<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.280> vote<00:04:49.430> goes

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
the union either way that the vote goes

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.900 
the union either way that the vote goes
sculpt<00:04:51.440> has<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> good<00:04:51.740> relationship<00:04:52.310> with<00:04:52.460> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
sculpt has a good relationship with the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.550 
sculpt has a good relationship with the
other<00:04:53.030> countries<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.140> United

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
other countries and in the United

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.000 
other countries and in the United
Kingdom<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:56.150> it<00:04:56.360> certainly<00:04:56.690> has<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:57.200> seems<00:04:57.890> to

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
Kingdom and it certainly has a seems to

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.920 
Kingdom and it certainly has a seems to
have<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.160> better<00:04:58.460> relationship<00:04:58.790> with<00:04:59.240> Iowa<00:04:59.720> to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
have a better relationship with Iowa to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.410 
have a better relationship with Iowa to
an<00:05:00.380> independent<00:05:01.010> country<00:05:01.160> and<00:05:01.910> then<00:05:02.090> England

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
an independent country and then England

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.450 
an independent country and then England
and<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:03.110> think<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.500> Scotland<00:05:03.770> could<00:05:04.040> possibly

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
and I think that Scotland could possibly

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.810 
and I think that Scotland could possibly
have<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.700> better<00:05:05.030> relationship<00:05:05.330> with<00:05:05.780> England

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
have a better relationship with England

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.050 
have a better relationship with England

the arguments within the independence

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.090 
the arguments within the independence
referendum<00:05:16.120> arguments<00:05:17.120> seem<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.360> be<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.110> yes

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100

think<00:05:24.380> it's<00:05:24.500> about<00:05:24.650> being<00:05:25.010> anti<00:05:25.430> English<00:05:25.820> I

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
think it's about being anti English I

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.220 
think it's about being anti English I
think<00:05:26.660> it's<00:05:26.810> about<00:05:27.110> autonomy<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.160> being<00:05:29.230> if

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
think it's about autonomy and being if

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.680 
think it's about autonomy and being if
it's<00:05:30.440> going<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.680> be<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:30.920> worst<00:05:31.310> country<00:05:31.790> on<00:05:32.660> our

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
it's going to be a worst country on our

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.020 
it's going to be a worst country on our
own<00:05:32.990> then<00:05:33.710> we've<00:05:34.250> only<00:05:34.430> got<00:05:34.640> ourselves<00:05:34.730> to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
own then we've only got ourselves to

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.790 
own then we've only got ourselves to
blame<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:35.930> don't<00:05:36.230> see<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:37.220> it's<00:05:37.640> about

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
blame so I don't see that it's about

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.860 
blame so I don't see that it's about
being<00:05:39.800> anti<00:05:40.220> English<00:05:40.610> ahem

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.690 

if<00:05:44.870> we<00:05:45.200> can<00:05:45.440> if<00:05:45.680> if<00:05:45.980> we<00:05:46.160> can<00:05:46.310> be<00:05:46.520> our<00:05:46.670> own

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
if we can if if we can be our own

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.320 
if we can if if we can be our own
country<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.420> we'll<00:05:47.930> be<00:05:48.050> worse<00:05:48.260> off<00:05:48.730> then<00:05:49.730> we

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
country and we'll be worse off then we

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.420 
country and we'll be worse off then we
will<00:05:50.540> have<00:05:50.780> upon<00:05:51.170> ourselves<00:05:51.290> to<00:05:51.830> do<00:05:52.010> something

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
will have upon ourselves to do something

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.930 
will have upon ourselves to do something
about<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:53.290> so<00:05:54.290> rather<00:05:54.500> than<00:05:54.620> get<00:05:54.920> too<00:05:55.190> into<00:05:55.820> the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
about it so rather than get too into the

about it so rather than get too into the
politics<00:05:56.420> of<00:05:56.660> it<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.700> this<00:05:58.700> pretty<00:05:59.000> much<00:05:59.090> is<00:05:59.270> a

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
politics of it and this pretty much is a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.800 
politics of it and this pretty much is a
statement<00:06:00.380> of<00:06:01.240> represent<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.360> point<00:06:02.690> in

statement of represent that point in

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.270
