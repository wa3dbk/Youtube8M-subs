00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.700
 no 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.700
 Oh 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.240
 well that's it everyone sic footers 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 I hope you're fine for my 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.599
 it's going really well 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.279
 today we find ourselves on I was 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.020
 honest for episode 8 outfits 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.910
 secret so for this episode will be the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.140
 holding a soldier so no matter 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.089
 which soldier it will be rather the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.320
 military who are in the desert so then 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.460
 to make this outfit you go 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.449
 of course you go into a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.400
 clothes shop 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.900
 after you approach the saleswoman for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 see the outfits and now you go 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.430
 they are held exterminators for 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.049
 buy the tundra outfit so now 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.489
 you leave the detainees menu you go 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.869
 in the interactions menu to go 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.820
 in the protections and now you 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.809
 display the ultra-heavy protection of 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 quattro that it's really a 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.460
 protection that looks like camouflage 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.900
 tunes of holding so then 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.490
 now for the workshop will have to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.439
 obligatorily a quad so that's 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.280
 really essential so then you 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.990
 go first to go in 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.210
 the inventory in accessories and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.130
 you will choose the desert helmet so 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.360
 the bulletproof helmet stranded earlier so 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.040
 now you press square for 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 set the helmet is so remember 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.970
 also to wear the helmet with 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.290
 so otherwise your character is not going 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.850
 put his helmet on you go up 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.080
 on the quad so now you go 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.550
 get on the quad and when your 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.900
 character will start putting the headphones 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.940
 that you will quickly select the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.950
 desert mask so the same mask as the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.270
 If under the mask strand Nancy point 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.310
 everything went well you should have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.680
 the brown bulletproof helmet on the mask 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.030
 fighting strand so so now if 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.560
 you get off your quad your 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.880
 character is going to simply removed his 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.270
 headphones and suddenly you could have both 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 accessories at the same time so then 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.909
 you will quickly get off the quad and 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.530
 avoid going to the store to go 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.909
 in a clothing category and so 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.800
 that 's going to save both 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.180
 accessories at the same time and so you 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.740
 will not have any problem the helmet will not 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.970
 will not be removed or the Basque you 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.590
 will always have both accessories in 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.150
 same time so so now you 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.680

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.940
