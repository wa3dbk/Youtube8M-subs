00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.020
 why 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.350
 yes 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.850
 so 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.700
 hello gamers and welcome to this first 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.080
 a boxing of this time we bring you 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.440
 as we had previously commented 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.440
 the value of the 3 limited edition with the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.280
 additional downloadable content from back 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.940
 to karkand 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.010
 good the equitador previously the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.570
 plastic already not to do the annoying 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.330
 that I would have to remove it with a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.060
 hand for this big good we open it and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.180
 as we can see includes two discs the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.250
 which the first 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.400
 is the disc one obviously the multi 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 power and the code in this album I love you 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.380
 say that it includes the textures package 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.270
 hd which I recommend you to compose 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.120
 this disc first afterwards already do what 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 who want later we have disk 2 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.110
 which contains the campaign of a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.350
 player 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:16.360
 and on this side we have a 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.540
 something curious the role of 'medal of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.990
 honor ' 1 I suppose for a new 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.720
 communal method that went the 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.720
 we have 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.150
 the pass which cleans him and pipes for 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 the other for the soccer neighborhood agreed 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.090
 which says that by entering this code 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.240
 is going to activate the special edition of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.150
 our game is worth we also have a 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.430
 great club brochure that says we've 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.129
 won a 1911 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.379
 they are going to give them they are going to unblock the 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:56.780
 put the game and play multiplayer a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:00.530
 m-19 with silencer also comes a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.019
 little propaganda of the demo 's 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.180
 mass effect 3 which when putting the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.629
 banfield 3 are going to give us these 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.290
 nice plates of mass courtesy 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.900
 effect 3 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.470
 it also includes 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.079
 this booklet that would practically be the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.909
 manual but only what is the 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.909
 multiplayer on xbox live 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 and one that is what it occupies 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.209
 the 90 day limit 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.180
 Finally out that the manual is not 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.640
 included in the disk 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.200
 I have seen other editions of all the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.319
 world which are better because 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.180
 They include a small image but anyway 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.079
 gamers that would be all 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.670
 and I want to tell you that unfortunately 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.670
 we can take out the unboxing when I had 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.859
 so they did not have to send him and 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.859
 it came just 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.890
 in a few days 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.470
 d 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.280
 it's ok to subscribe like the book
