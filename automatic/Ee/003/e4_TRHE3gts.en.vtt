modules<00:00:05.640> would<00:00:05.819> come<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.720> would<00:00:06.960> benefit

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
modules would come that would benefit

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.350 
modules would come that would benefit
from<00:00:07.529> tanks<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:09.559> here<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.679> go<00:00:10.889> first<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.880> all<00:00:12.000> we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
from tanks so here we go first of all we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.900 
from tanks so here we go first of all we
have<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.019> guy<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.679> open<00:00:14.190> tank

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
have this guy the open tank

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.849 
have this guy the open tank
sort<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> AE<00:00:15.599> top<00:00:15.960> time<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.800> only

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
sort of like a AE top time but can only

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.070 
sort of like a AE top time but can only
store<00:00:17.250> seven<00:00:17.580> buckets<00:00:17.910> instead<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.359> 40<00:00:18.750> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
store seven buckets instead of 40 and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.040 
store seven buckets instead of 40 and
the<00:00:19.529> special<00:00:19.890> thing<00:00:20.100> with<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.480> let

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the special thing with this is if we let

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.500 
the special thing with this is if we let
the<00:00:22.199> rain<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:22.619> down<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the rain come down we can see that the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
the rain come down we can see that the
water<00:00:24.720> level<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.289> increasing<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
water level is increasing so it's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.570 
water level is increasing so it's
actually<00:00:26.730> catching<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> rain<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> tank

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
actually catching the rain in the tank

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.510 
actually catching the rain in the tank
and<00:00:29.580> they<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.050> let's<00:00:31.590> turn<00:00:32.160> off<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and they go that one let's turn off the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
and they go that one let's turn off the
rain<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.210> next<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> tiny<00:00:34.290> thing

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
rain the next thing is just a tiny thing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
rain the next thing is just a tiny thing
it's<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.550> creative<00:00:35.820> tank<00:00:36.239> or<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.630> use

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's just a creative tank or you can use

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.319 
it's just a creative tank or you can use
to<00:00:37.469> test<00:00:37.710> things<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.160> million<00:00:38.399> buckets<00:00:38.760> well

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to test things two million buckets well

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.910 
to test things two million buckets well
I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.660> know<00:00:39.750> how<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.079> fits<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.649> Cup

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I don't know how that fits in that Cup

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
I don't know how that fits in that Cup
but<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:42.360> used<00:00:42.570> creative<00:00:43.050> engines

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
but you know they used creative engines

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
but you know they used creative engines
so<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.620> does<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.920> work

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so how does that work

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.560 
so how does that work
here<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.750> AM<00:00:46.910> incinerator<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.390> that's

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
here we go with AM incinerator so that's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
here we go with AM incinerator so that's
a<00:00:48.690> cool<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.829> four<00:00:50.070> slots<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a cool thing we have four slots here and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
a cool thing we have four slots here and
as<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.960> set<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> drill

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
as you can see I set it up with a drill

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.150 
as you can see I set it up with a drill
a<00:00:53.489> internal<00:00:54.120> tank<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.440> sights<00:00:55.739> chest

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
a internal tank and some sights chest

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.209 
a internal tank and some sights chest
and<00:00:56.399> let's<00:00:57.360> let<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.920> drill<00:00:59.730> those<00:00:59.910> blocks

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
and let's let it a drill those blocks

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
and let's let it a drill those blocks
oops<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.320> they

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
oops there we go and as you can see they

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.609 
oops there we go and as you can see they
went<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.220> however<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> put<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.869> cobble

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
went here however if I put a cobble

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
went here however if I put a cobble
stone<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.970> only<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.479> map<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
stone here I can only put one map that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.730 
stone here I can only put one map that
works<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> filter<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.880> now<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.740> well

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
works as a filter so now I can well

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
works as a filter so now I can well
light<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.360> my<00:01:15.360> t<00:01:15.420> cobblestone<00:01:15.900> again<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
light it to my t cobblestone again and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
light it to my t cobblestone again and
now<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:17.880> cobblestone<00:01:18.420> here

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
now we don't get any cobblestone here

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
now we don't get any cobblestone here
because<00:01:19.259> that's<00:01:19.530> incinerator<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.729> will

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because that's incinerator it will

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260 
because that's incinerator it will
however<00:01:21.360> drain<00:01:22.110> three<00:01:22.500> units<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> lava<00:01:23.369> every

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
however drain three units of lava every

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
however drain three units of lava every
block<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.170> destroying<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.460> ever

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
block it is destroying if we have ever

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
block it is destroying if we have ever
now<00:01:27.000> put<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.560> won't<00:01:28.950> incinerate

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
now put that here it won't incinerate

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.880 
now put that here it won't incinerate
that<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> filter<00:01:31.530> but

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that because that's not the filter but

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
that because that's not the filter but
if<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.240> incinerate<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.780> as

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
if we do that it will incinerate that as

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.390 
if we do that it will incinerate that as
well<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.590> use<00:01:34.740> incinerate<00:01:35.189> for

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well so you can use incinerate for

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.050 
well so you can use incinerate for
different<00:01:35.729> things

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
different things

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
different things
so<00:01:36.329> maybe<00:01:36.869> cobblestone<00:01:37.619> dirt<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.640> don't

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so maybe cobblestone dirt and I don't

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.210 
so maybe cobblestone dirt and I don't
know<00:01:38.939> sand<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.259> yeah<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.950> four

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
know sand it's on a lot yeah for four

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.530 
know sand it's on a lot yeah for four
different<00:01:41.490> things<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.850> incinerate<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
different things we can incinerate and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
different things we can incinerate and
then<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> will<00:01:43.200> drain<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.470> lava<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.250> run

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then it will drain the lava if you run

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.020 
then it will drain the lava if you run
out<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.670> lava

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
out of lava

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.280 
out of lava
then<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> won't<00:01:45.540> rid<00:01:45.750> incinerate<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
then it won't rid incinerate that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.889 
then it won't rid incinerate that
anything<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.360> here<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.450> go

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
anything so that's that here we go

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.420 
anything so that's that here we go
with<00:01:49.350> two<00:01:50.340> neat<00:01:50.790> things<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.680> thermal

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
with two neat things we have a thermal

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.080 
with two neat things we have a thermal
engine<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:56.009> law<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.790> needs

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
engine so that one is using law it needs

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
engine so that one is using law it needs
a<00:01:57.270> tank<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.229> sort<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.890> draining

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
a tank of some sort and it's draining

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.389 
a tank of some sort and it's draining
the<00:01:59.729> lava<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.450> produce<00:02:00.899> power<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.950> here<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.219> go

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the lava to produce power so here we go

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.709 
the lava to produce power so here we go
it's<00:02:02.790> draining<00:02:03.329> yeah<00:02:03.869> better<00:02:04.820> like<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.850> then

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's draining yeah better like that then

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440 
it's draining yeah better like that then
we<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.380> dude<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.910> let's<00:02:08.910> set<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.119> today

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we have this dude and let's set it today

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.400 
we have this dude and let's set it today
first<00:02:09.830> because<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.009> getting<00:02:11.340> white<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
first because it's getting white and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.640 
first because it's getting white and
this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
this
it's<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:14.730> called<00:02:14.940> thermal<00:02:15.390> ending<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's also called thermal ending but this

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's also called thermal ending but this
is<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.140> advanced<00:02:16.440> thermal<00:02:16.739> engine<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.489> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
is the advanced thermal engine and you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.759 
is the advanced thermal engine and you
need<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.450> reinforced<00:02:19.050> hole<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.739> work

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
need a reinforced hole for that to work

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.530 
need a reinforced hole for that to work
the<00:02:20.400> good<00:02:20.550> thing<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.879> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.269> it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the good thing with this is that it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.930 
the good thing with this is that it
doesn't<00:02:22.080> drain<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.470> much<00:02:22.530> lava<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> other

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
doesn't drain as much lava as the other

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.759 
doesn't drain as much lava as the other
one<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:26.390> more<00:02:27.390> lava<00:02:28.019> efficient<00:02:28.560> but

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
one so so it's more lava efficient but

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.050 
one so so it's more lava efficient but
because<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:30.180> used<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.569> lava<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:32.549> such<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
because we we used a lava in in such a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
because we we used a lava in in such a
way<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.510> also<00:02:33.660> need<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> cool<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.260> down<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:34.769> then

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
way we also need to cool it down so then

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.410 
way we also need to cool it down so then
you<00:02:35.129> need<00:02:35.280> some<00:02:35.459> water<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.910> cool<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.090> down<00:02:36.209> so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you need some water to cool it down so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.360 
you need some water to cool it down so
you<00:02:36.480> need<00:02:36.660> two<00:02:36.930> tags<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.290> advanced<00:02:41.220> one

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
you need two tags so so the advanced one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.990 
you need two tags so so the advanced one
can<00:02:41.959> can<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.200> more<00:02:43.379> power<00:02:43.620> from<00:02:43.950> every<00:02:44.549> unit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
can can get more power from every unit

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.420 
can can get more power from every unit
of<00:02:45.150> lava<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.110> need<00:02:46.440> some<00:02:46.470> water<00:02:46.860> as<00:02:47.040> well<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
of lava but need some water as well to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.009 
of lava but need some water as well to
cool<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.790> cool<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.030> down<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.569> that's<00:02:48.690> those

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
cool it cool it down so that's those

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.740 
cool it cool it down so that's those
thanks<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> thermal<00:02:49.920> Indians<00:02:50.250> awesome<00:02:51.209> here

thanks to thermal Indians awesome here

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.420 
thanks to thermal Indians awesome here
we<00:02:51.900> go<00:02:52.049> with<00:02:52.349> some<00:02:52.590> neat<00:02:53.099> setup

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
we go with some neat setup

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.309 
we go with some neat setup
it<00:02:53.640> looks<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> cleaner<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:54.989> green

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
it looks like the cleaner but it's green

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.920 
it looks like the cleaner but it's green
and<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.880> can't<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.299> see<00:02:57.450> anything<00:02:57.540> here

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
and you can't really see anything here

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.729 
and you can't really see anything here
from<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.799> let's<00:02:59.129> set<00:02:59.370> up<00:02:59.549> a<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:01.079> little

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
from it so let's set up a a little

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.600 
from it so let's set up a a little
something<00:03:02.160> here<00:03:03.200> oops<00:03:04.250> here<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:07.459> let<00:03:08.459> that

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
something here oops here we go let that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.789 
something here oops here we go let that
can't<00:03:09.090> pass<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:12.230> how<00:03:13.230> do<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.379> want<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.650> to

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
can't pass and how do I want this to

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.430 
can't pass and how do I want this to
work<00:03:15.980> let's<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.129> it<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:18.230> there<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.260> go

work let's do it like this there you go
no<00:03:19.859> it's<00:03:20.130> going<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.730> try<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.630> drill<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.200> but

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
no it's going to try to drill that but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.059 
no it's going to try to drill that but
the<00:03:22.680> liquid<00:03:22.889> detector<00:03:23.549> sense<00:03:23.880> oh<00:03:24.120> snap

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
the liquid detector sense oh snap

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.590 
the liquid detector sense oh snap
there's<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.130> liquid<00:03:26.519> nearby<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.880> can't<00:03:27.329> remove

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
there's a liquid nearby I can't remove

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.960 
there's a liquid nearby I can't remove
it<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.099> liquid<00:03:29.400> centers<00:03:29.819> say

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it but then the liquid centers say

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.339 
it but then the liquid centers say
alright<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:31.019> do<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.549> liquid<00:03:33.269> cleaner<00:03:33.599> in

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
alright I do have a liquid cleaner in

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.740 
alright I do have a liquid cleaner in
endicott<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.220> also<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.209> want<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.450> clean<00:03:36.660> it

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
endicott so also that want to clean it

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.870 
endicott so also that want to clean it
up<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.049> there<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:37.440> go<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.799> clean<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.160> up<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
up and there we go I clean it up so if I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.199 
up and there we go I clean it up so if I
continue<00:03:41.880> with<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:45.980> here<00:03:46.980> we<00:03:47.040> go<00:03:47.250> oh<00:03:47.489> right

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
continue with this here we go oh right

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.750 
continue with this here we go oh right
now<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> mess<00:03:51.079> so<00:03:52.079> now<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.919> will<00:03:53.099> train<00:03:53.340> try

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
now it's a mess so now it will train try

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.759 
now it's a mess so now it will train try
to<00:03:53.819> drain<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.500> won't<00:03:55.709> really

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
to drain that but it won't really

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.140 
to drain that but it won't really
succeed<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:59.280> going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.579> drain<00:03:59.760> as<00:04:00.030> much

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
succeed so it's going to drain as much

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.020 
succeed so it's going to drain as much
as<00:04:00.569> possible<00:04:00.989> which<00:04:01.889> will<00:04:01.919> be<00:04:02.340> three<00:04:02.579> buckets

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
as possible which will be three buckets

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.979 
as possible which will be three buckets
and<00:04:03.269> then<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.109> went<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.620> lava<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.720> yeah<00:04:06.720> it

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
and then it went in that lava so yeah it

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.110 
and then it went in that lava so yeah it
turned<00:04:07.200> into<00:04:07.319> a<00:04:07.440> mess<00:04:07.590> because<00:04:07.919> well<00:04:08.549> usually

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
turned into a mess because well usually

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.210 
turned into a mess because well usually
it<00:04:09.690> won't<00:04:09.870> really<00:04:10.139> go<00:04:10.319> here<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.040> open

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
it won't really go here and you open

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.460 
it won't really go here and you open
this<00:04:11.819> wouldn't<00:04:12.269> really<00:04:12.419> happen<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.200> would

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
this wouldn't really happen if it would

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.039 
this wouldn't really happen if it would
be<00:04:13.680> allowed<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:13.950> drill<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:14.910> its<00:04:15.060> own<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
be allowed to drill on its own in in the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.199 
be allowed to drill on its own in in the
ground<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:16.950> about<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.970> some

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
ground so that's about it we have some

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.289 
ground so that's about it we have some
new<00:04:18.389> tanks<00:04:18.870> some<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.160> incinerator<00:04:20.669> to

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
new tanks some the incinerator to

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.430 
new tanks some the incinerator to
thermal<00:04:21.870> engines<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:22.770> well<00:04:23.310> we<00:04:23.669> had<00:04:24.030> a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
thermal engines and then well we had a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.529 
thermal engines and then well we had a
liquid<00:04:25.440> cleaner<00:04:25.860> before<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.490> kill<00:04:26.969> it

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
liquid cleaner before it kill it

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.640 
liquid cleaner before it kill it
so<00:04:27.690> that's<00:04:27.870> about<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.080> thanks<00:04:28.530> for<00:04:28.560> watching

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
so that's about it thanks for watching

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.599 
so that's about it thanks for watching
