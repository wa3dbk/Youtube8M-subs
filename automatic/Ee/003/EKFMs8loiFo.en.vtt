review over the rattlesnake any

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.259 
review over the rattlesnake any
rattlesnake<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:07.020> machine<00:00:07.350> pistol<00:00:08.269> even

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
rattlesnake is a machine pistol even

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.110 
rattlesnake is a machine pistol even
though<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.630> singular<00:00:10.610> so<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:11.849> more

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
though it is singular so it's not more

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.999 
though it is singular so it's not more
of<00:00:12.179> those<00:00:12.269> dual<00:00:12.630> machine<00:00:13.139> pistols<00:00:13.559> like<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
of those dual machine pistols like the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.390 
of those dual machine pistols like the
Hurricanes<00:00:14.400> quick<00:00:14.940> fix<00:00:15.740> type<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> second

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
Hurricanes quick fix type of the second

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.779 
Hurricanes quick fix type of the second
thing<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.859> makes<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.220> different<00:00:20.279> from

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
thing so what makes this different from

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.990 
thing so what makes this different from
other<00:00:21.090> machine<00:00:21.480> pistols<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.000> absolute

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
other machine pistols is the absolute

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
other machine pistols is the absolute
amazing<00:00:24.330> hit<00:00:24.660> fire<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.170> could<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> i've

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
amazing hit fire I could do with it i've

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.370 
amazing hit fire I could do with it i've
seen<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.820> people<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
seen that people don't really like the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.279 
seen that people don't really like the
sights<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.039> bounce<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.420> thing<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
sights the bounce to it but the thing is

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100 
sights the bounce to it but the thing is
I<00:00:31.679> never<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.880> sights<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.989> only

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I never use the sights really it's only

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
I never use the sights really it's only
a<00:00:34.230> few<00:00:34.410> times<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:34.980> they're<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.309> super<00:00:35.730> long

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
a few times when they're like super long

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.220 
a few times when they're like super long
distances<00:00:36.630> away<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:39.329> really<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> do

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
distances away so all really all you do

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.869 
distances away so all really all you do
is<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.530> hip<00:00:40.680> fire<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.250> gun<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is just hip fire with this gun and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.040 
is just hip fire with this gun and
you'll<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.180> crazy<00:00:42.600> amount<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> headshots

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you'll get crazy amount of headshots

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
you'll get crazy amount of headshots
I've<00:00:43.590> noticed<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:45.000> better<00:00:45.360> results

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I've noticed that I have better results

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.130 
I've noticed that I have better results
with<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.440> when<00:00:47.219> I'm<00:00:47.309> aiming<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.879> headshots

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
with this when I'm aiming for headshots

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.979 
with this when I'm aiming for headshots
compared<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.620> twister<00:00:50.160> machine<00:00:50.489> pistol

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
compared to the twister machine pistol

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
compared to the twister machine pistol
this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.469> nice<00:00:52.649> gun<00:00:53.309> especially

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this is a really nice gun especially

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
this is a really nice gun especially
since<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.270> doesn't<00:00:54.480> bring<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> damaged<00:00:55.399> reactor

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
since it doesn't bring a damaged reactor

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.470 
since it doesn't bring a damaged reactor
at<00:00:56.520> times

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.930 

has<00:01:02.140> printed<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.739> villages<00:01:03.100> while<00:01:03.340> reload

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
has printed in the villages while reload

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.230 
has printed in the villages while reload
speed<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.570> good<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:06.159> has<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.340> really<00:01:06.640> nice<00:01:06.820> solid

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
speed is good it has a really nice solid

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.750 
speed is good it has a really nice solid
amount<00:01:07.450> when<00:01:08.229> used<00:01:08.590> with<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.159> Grenadier<00:01:09.640> I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
amount when used with the Grenadier I

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.460 
amount when used with the Grenadier I
feel<00:01:10.000> like<00:01:10.119> it's<00:01:10.330> best<00:01:10.990> used<00:01:11.260> with<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
feel like it's best used with the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.320 
feel like it's best used with the
Grenadier<00:01:11.890> compared<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.490> something<00:01:12.909> like<00:01:13.030> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
Grenadier compared to something like a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.999 
Grenadier compared to something like a
shadow<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:16.540> doesn't<00:01:16.960> really<00:01:17.229> use

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
shadow and it doesn't really use

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.630 
shadow and it doesn't really use
mobility<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.850> used<00:01:19.119> more<00:01:19.479> like<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:21.369> saying

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
mobility it used more like I'm saying

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.999 
mobility it used more like I'm saying
it's<00:01:21.910> just<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.420> pure<00:01:22.750> fire<00:01:23.320> right<00:01:23.619> bonus

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
it's just the pure fire right bonus

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.969 
it's just the pure fire right bonus
especially<00:01:24.910> since<00:01:25.210> if<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.570> have<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.110> extra

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
especially since if you have the extra

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.620 
especially since if you have the extra
capacity<00:01:27.280> for<00:01:28.150> more<00:01:29.400> mo<00:01:30.400> this<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.300> really

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
capacity for more mo this is a really

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.290 
capacity for more mo this is a really
nice<00:01:31.780> weapon<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.250> if<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.580> use<00:01:33.729> scavenger

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
nice weapon and if you use scavenger

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.820 
nice weapon and if you use scavenger
you're<00:01:34.570> pretty<00:01:34.960> much<00:01:34.990> never<00:01:35.350> running<00:01:35.619> out<00:01:35.800> of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
you're pretty much never running out of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.830 
you're pretty much never running out of
ammo<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.430> you<00:01:36.880> can<00:01:37.030> stay<00:01:37.210> on<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.450> front<00:01:37.690> lines

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
ammo and you can stay on the front lines

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.830 
ammo and you can stay on the front lines
as<00:01:37.960> long<00:01:38.140> as<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.320> don't<00:01:38.500> take<00:01:38.710> damage<00:01:39.690> so<00:01:40.690> when

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
as long as you don't take damage so when

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840 
as long as you don't take damage so when
using<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> rattlesnake<00:01:41.830> compared<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.399> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
using the rattlesnake compared to the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.020 
using the rattlesnake compared to the
striker<00:01:43.330> you're<00:01:44.170> basically<00:01:44.580> gaining<00:01:45.580> more

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
striker you're basically gaining more

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.029 
striker you're basically gaining more
damage<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:47.740> range<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:49.720> fire<00:01:49.990> rate<00:01:50.229> for

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
damage more range and more fire rate for

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.800 
damage more range and more fire rate for
the<00:01:51.130> risk<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.970> mean<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.450> loss<00:01:52.660> of<00:01:53.020> mobility<00:01:53.710> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the risk I mean the loss of mobility and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.240 
the risk I mean the loss of mobility and
accuracy<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> accuracy<00:01:56.470> doesn't<00:01:57.070> really

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
accuracy but the accuracy doesn't really

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.550 
accuracy but the accuracy doesn't really
make<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.520> difference<00:01:57.850> too<00:01:58.240> much<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.840> long<00:01:59.229> as

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
make a difference too much as long as

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.600 
make a difference too much as long as
you're<00:01:59.800> not<00:01:59.920> scoping<00:02:00.460> in<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.340> aim<00:02:03.340> down

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
you're not scoping in the the aim down

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.029 
you're not scoping in the the aim down
the<00:02:03.670> sights<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.410> scope<00:02:05.649> is<00:02:05.800> really

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
the sights because the scope is really

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.699 
the sights because the scope is really
nice<00:02:06.190> for<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.209> striker<00:02:07.720> compared<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.440> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
nice for the striker compared to the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.070 
nice for the striker compared to the
rattlesnake<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:10.119> if<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.390> don't<00:02:10.630> really<00:02:10.929> like

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
rattlesnake so if you don't really like

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.300 
rattlesnake so if you don't really like
the<00:02:11.200> bounce<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:11.980> can't<00:02:12.220> really

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the bounce of it and you can't really

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.070 
the bounce of it and you can't really
get<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.849> really<00:02:12.970> well<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.450> would

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
get all it really well I would

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.270 
get all it really well I would
definitely<00:02:14.200> go<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.650> striker<00:02:14.890> instead

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
definitely go with the striker instead

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160 
definitely go with the striker instead
like<00:02:15.459> you're<00:02:15.580> more<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.849> hip<00:02:16.000> fire<00:02:16.209> person<00:02:16.630> go

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
like you're more of a hip fire person go

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.380 
like you're more of a hip fire person go
rattlesnake<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.209> when<00:02:19.300> you're

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
rattlesnake and then when you're

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.540 
rattlesnake and then when you're
comparing<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.200> rattlesnake<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.069> twister

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
comparing the rattlesnake to the twister

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.089 
comparing the rattlesnake to the twister
which<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.270> another<00:02:22.480> machine<00:02:22.720> pistol<00:02:23.290> you

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
which is another machine pistol you

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.970 
which is another machine pistol you
would<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.870> sacrificing<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.290> damage<00:02:26.739> on<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
would be sacrificing the damage on the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.500 
would be sacrificing the damage on the
rattlesnake

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
rattlesnake

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.130 
rattlesnake
or<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.900> twister<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.470> also<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.250> fire<00:02:30.549> rate<00:02:30.790> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
or the twister and also the fire rate so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.110 
or the twister and also the fire rate so
just<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.349> mix<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.829> match<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:33.849> I

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
just really mix and match here but I

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.140 
just really mix and match here but I
kind<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.569> like<00:02:34.720> damage<00:02:35.079> on<00:02:35.230> twister<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.150> kind

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
kind of like damage on twister and kind

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.149 
kind of like damage on twister and kind
of<00:02:37.269> makes<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.989> difference<00:02:38.349> really<00:02:38.680> depends<00:02:39.099> on

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
of makes a difference really depends on

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.059 
of makes a difference really depends on
which<00:02:39.519> classes<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.060> amazing<00:02:40.540> at<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.750> time

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
which classes are amazing at the time

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.490 
which classes are amazing at the time
but<00:02:42.069> in<00:02:42.459> general<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.420> think<00:02:43.450> rattlesnake<00:02:44.349> is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
but in general I think rattlesnake is

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.509 
but in general I think rattlesnake is
one<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.860> better<00:02:46.650> poised<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.310> some<00:02:48.459> of

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
one of the better poised it it's some of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.300 
one of the better poised it it's some of
the<00:02:48.640> better<00:02:48.790> machine<00:02:49.180> pistols<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.620> might

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the better machine pistols and I might

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.800 
the better machine pistols and I might
like<00:02:51.700> them<00:02:51.909> a<00:02:52.000> little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.329> more<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
like them a little bit more on the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.259 
like them a little bit more on the
Grenadiers<00:02:53.319> compared<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.980> SMGs<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.000> going

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
Grenadiers compared to SMGs all I going

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.360 
Grenadiers compared to SMGs all I going
to<00:02:55.359> do<00:02:55.480> instead<00:02:55.629> so<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.620> definitely<00:02:56.829> consider

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to do instead so I definitely consider

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.059 
to do instead so I definitely consider
getting<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.120> rattlesnake<00:02:58.599> if<00:02:58.810> you're<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.530> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
getting the rattlesnake if you're in the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.899 
getting the rattlesnake if you're in the
mood<00:03:00.189> to<00:03:00.519> go<00:03:00.879> can<00:03:01.060> fire<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.299> guy<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:03.040> that's

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
mood to go can fire a guy so that's

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.460 
mood to go can fire a guy so that's
pretty<00:03:04.120> much<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.329> review<00:03:05.049> for<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
pretty much the review for the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.710 
pretty much the review for the
rattlesnake<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> great<00:03:06.489> weapon<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:07.120> good

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
rattlesnake it's a great weapon a good

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.809 
rattlesnake it's a great weapon a good

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
damage good fire right mobility pretty

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.610

much<00:03:09.940> everything<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.329> want<00:03:10.629> in<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.019> weapon<00:03:11.290> is

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
much everything you want in a weapon is

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.270 
much everything you want in a weapon is
there<00:03:12.359> like<00:03:13.359> sometimes<00:03:14.049> other<00:03:14.650> weapons<00:03:15.129> are

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
there like sometimes other weapons are

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.270 
there like sometimes other weapons are
better<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.639> other<00:03:15.819> situations<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
better in other situations but this is a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.160 
better in other situations but this is a
pretty<00:03:18.519> nice<00:03:18.940> weapon<00:03:19.150> especially<00:03:19.450> since<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
pretty nice weapon especially since the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.920 
pretty nice weapon especially since the
average<00:03:20.500> damage<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.980> I've<00:03:21.129> seen<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:22.450> pretty

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
average damage that I've seen is pretty

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.309 
average damage that I've seen is pretty
much<00:03:23.139> around<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.920> 40's<00:03:24.810> which<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:26.049> better

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
much around the 40's which is better

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.170 
much around the 40's which is better
than<00:03:26.560> some<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.889> those<00:03:26.980> SMGs<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:29.909> 17<00:03:30.909> power

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
than some of those SMGs but 17 power

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.809 
than some of those SMGs but 17 power
won't<00:03:31.629> really<00:03:31.989> get<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.349> some<00:03:32.650> places<00:03:32.889> but

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
won't really get you some places but

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.449 
won't really get you some places but
this<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.599> good<00:03:34.810> front<00:03:35.139> line<00:03:35.349> weapon<00:03:35.739> you're

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this is a good front line weapon you're

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.509 
this is a good front line weapon you're
there<00:03:36.790> grenade<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.900> going<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.109> deer<00:03:38.560> works

there grenade I'm going to deer works

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.400 
there grenade I'm going to deer works
for<00:03:39.730> those<00:03:39.849> kamikaze<00:03:40.510> theirs<00:03:40.840> as<00:03:41.019> well<00:03:41.049> you

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
just go forward and push the mouse down

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.680 
just go forward and push the mouse down
there<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.829> go<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.519> your<00:03:45.760> kind<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.329> weapon

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
pretty much it doesn't have that five

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.050 
pretty much it doesn't have that five
extra<00:03:49.510> bullets<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.709> striker<00:03:50.980> has<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.609> that's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
extra bullets the striker has but that's

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.800 
extra bullets the striker has but that's
