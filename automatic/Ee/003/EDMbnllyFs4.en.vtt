00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:09.930
 good I'm use of books for reading and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:11.640
 I extract the 'top ten' of the year 2012 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.460
 first book he told I'll start is the 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.970
 circus of the night a novel 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.810
 spectacular 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.329
 published by the publishing house planet 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.589
 we had an encounter with the author about 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.509
 how many bloggers it was a pity that 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.109
 they will be able to attend more because it was the truth 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.820
 which is very interesting and good because we 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.940
 it turned out very 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 let's say different the author very close 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.489
 very I do not know the truth is that we came out as 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.710
 with good experience of 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.980
 meeting and that only accentuated our 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 I want to continue reading the book like this 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 good I for my part I consider 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 one of the best books I 've read 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 not only in 2012 sir my life and it's a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 book that I recommend for all 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.830
 ages and types of audience the second 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.320
 book is the guardian among the rye ' 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.989
 jd salinger as we all know is a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.520
 great author and good although he only left 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.050
 let's say a jewel 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.330
 and to the one who is the guardian between 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.370
 rye ' I think you could say it is 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.370
 one of the best authors 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.310
 contemporaries and with this simple novelty 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.990
 Well, many aspects of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.000
 my life in my way of seeing things 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.640
 I am very proud to have been able to 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 have the opportunity to read by eating the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.570
 third book is heart of fire one of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.990
 the main bets of montena in 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.850
 this 2012 one in the past already 2012 is a 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.790
 Moya book is already a heart 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.970
 of fire and good then that in a first 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.710
 moment it was difficult for me to read and 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.690
 me because I did not read a reality then 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.360
 I thought they were misspellings 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.270
 of the valued but clear I missed 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.820
 that 50 pages later those will continue 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.530
 grammatical failures but good the book 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.810
 whole is full of faults I am a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.310
 notice but it's really worth it 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.649
 read it right now is reading it 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.720
 father and I hope you like the following 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.820
 book is premonition this saga written 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.990
 by full or walter is one of my 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.750
 favorites 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.970
 I believe durban fantasy 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 has one already shadow hunters and one 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.830
 several more sagas 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.209
 this is the second volume I have pending 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.980
 the third one but as there is not even 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.440
 date or title for the fourth book 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.840
 I think I'm going to take it easy is 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 pretty fat but in spite of it I will do it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.160
 in two days at exam time or is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.350
 what 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.580
 the truth came out right the next 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.650
 book is chronicle of a death announced 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 from gabriel garcÃ­a marquez I think this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.330
 book does not need a presentation because it is 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.950
 a classic among classics incredible the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.180
 way of narrating de gago and well then 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.030
 I honestly do not know what to tell you now 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.220
 that has already told us 10 the next 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.600
 book is marine legend what a great novel 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.880
 I do not know what else I can say to you that no 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.650
 had said the review the truth is that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.510
 I did not expect it to be so fast and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.000
 so addictive me the law then the same in 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.640
 two afternoons two days they learn hard and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.600
 well then 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.350
 I just loved singing 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 I do not know what I recommend obviously and not 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.970
 I know and also be promotion throughout 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.240
 this year so I do not know what I have not 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.420
 said of the beautiful cause the third part 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.790
 and until the penultimate one 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
 do not see four parts but the last 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.610
 published part of the saga guarantees 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.950
 six moons 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.920
 I thought it was spectacular the best 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.180
 all three so far with the end 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.650
 overwhelming but with many many 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.230
 I really want March to be able to 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.020
 read it in spanish the last one enjoy it 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.910
 whole and devour the final the boy with 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.530
 the striped pajama by john boyne other 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.630
 book that needs presentation and 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.380
 known for everything is both book and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.840
 good movie 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.820
 well that's perfect and the other two 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.520
 books that fall into the ranking I can not 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.160
 teach oslo because I do not have them physical 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.590

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.600

 to love charming is a novel like 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.830
 there is no other in juvenile literature 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.090

 I devoured in a very short time of message 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.030
 will last longer because it is not a novel 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.710
 fine but it really has a rhythm that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.440
 hooks and a central story 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.210
 with several frames there are in between 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.130
 they are really worth it 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.110

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.290
