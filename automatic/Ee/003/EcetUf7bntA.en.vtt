00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
so it really is great and I like just

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.140 
so it really is great and I like just
having<00:02:28.030> straight<00:02:28.720> tape<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.370> tape<00:02:30.370> emulator<00:02:30.940> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
having straight tape a tape emulator and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.430 
having straight tape a tape emulator and
just<00:02:31.360> being<00:02:31.569> able<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.870> tweak<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
just being able to tweak all the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.240 
just being able to tweak all the
different<00:02:33.599> different<00:02:34.599> functions<00:02:35.110> I've<00:02:36.010> got

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
different different functions I've got

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.039 
different different functions I've got
this<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:37.500> mini<00:02:38.500> expression<00:02:39.130> knob<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.420> I

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
this little mini expression knob that I

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.020 
this little mini expression knob that I
have<00:02:41.380> hooked<00:02:42.130> up<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.519> that's<00:02:42.670> currently

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
have hooked up to it that's currently

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.140 
have hooked up to it that's currently
controlling<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.769> repeats<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.030> they

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
controlling the the repeats so they

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.690 
controlling the the repeats so they
crank<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:48.549> know

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
crank it up then it's a you know

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.570 
crank it up then it's a you know
starting<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.750> oscillate<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.410> then<00:02:50.620> like

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
starting to oscillate and then like

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.789 
starting to oscillate and then like
here's<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.299> repeat<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:52.870> control<00:02:53.680> that

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
here's just one repeat so control that

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.270 
here's just one repeat so control that
with<00:02:53.920> my<00:02:54.069> foot<00:02:54.310> when<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:54.730> playing<00:02:54.940> live<00:02:55.239> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
with my foot when I'm playing live and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.839 
with my foot when I'm playing live and
stuff<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.519> from<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.500> my<00:02:59.549> signal<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.580> split

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
stuff so from there my signal is split

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.530 
stuff so from there my signal is split
stereo<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.280> mono<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.700> stereo<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.299> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
stereo so it's mono and stereo out and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.289 
stereo so it's mono and stereo out and
then<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.660> go<00:03:04.840> stereo<00:03:05.290> into<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.090> time<00:03:07.090> factor

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
then I go stereo into the time factor

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.090 
then I go stereo into the time factor
which<00:03:07.900> has<00:03:08.140> been<00:03:08.320> updated<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.980> latest

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.039 
which has been updated to the latest
firmware<00:03:09.549> which<00:03:09.790> sounds<00:03:10.209> great<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:13.600> stereo

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
firmware which sounds great so stereo

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.199 
firmware which sounds great so stereo
and<00:03:14.260> stereo<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.739> there<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.820> go<00:03:15.940> into<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and stereo out there and we go into the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
there for a while but it

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.529 
there for a while but it
has<00:04:17.650> been<00:04:18.650> having<00:04:18.979> some<00:04:19.160> problems<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.940> just

eats<00:04:20.690> up<00:04:20.930> tubes<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.350> crazy<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.039> I<00:04:23.289> opted<00:04:24.289> for

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
eats up tubes like crazy so I opted for

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.860 
eats up tubes like crazy so I opted for
smaller<00:04:25.430> amp<00:04:25.819> to<00:04:25.970> make<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> stereo<00:04:26.630> rig<00:04:26.840> a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
smaller amp to make the stereo rig a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.400 
smaller amp to make the stereo rig a
little<00:04:27.199> more<00:04:27.349> manageable<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.870> Bulls<00:04:30.110> jr.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
little more manageable and the Bulls jr.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.749 
little more manageable and the Bulls jr.
just<00:04:30.530> sounds<00:04:30.800> great<00:04:30.979> too<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.370> what<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.610> with
