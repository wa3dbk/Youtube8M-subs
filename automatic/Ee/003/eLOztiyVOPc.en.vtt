00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
let's start out with the first two five

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.790 
let's start out with the first two five
one<00:00:38.710> in<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.100> key<00:00:39.280> of<00:00:39.310> D<00:00:39.550> flat<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:41.320> have<00:00:41.500> an<00:00:41.649> E

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
one in the key of D flat you have an E

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.790 
one in the key of D flat you have an E
flat<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.540> flat<00:00:43.540> D<00:00:44.280> flat<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.570> we<00:00:46.810> play<00:00:47.020> E<00:00:47.380> flat

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
flat a flat D flat so we play E flat

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.510 
flat a flat D flat so we play E flat
minor<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:49.380> flat<00:00:50.380> major<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:53.410> d<00:00:53.649> flat<00:00:53.890> major

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
minor a flat major and a d flat major

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.729 
minor a flat major and a d flat major
those<00:00:55.149> are<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.480> core<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.170> first<00:00:56.410> if<00:00:56.590> I

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
those are the core so the first if I

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:05.200 
those are the core so the first if I
want<00:00:57.899> to<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:02.469> here

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.459 

all<00:01:05.630> right<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.170> that's<00:01:06.290> pretty<00:01:06.410> basic

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.380 

okay<00:01:15.469> so<00:01:15.549> let's<00:01:16.549> let's<00:01:16.789> start<00:01:16.880> off<00:01:17.179> with<00:01:17.329> that

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
okay so let's let's start off with that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.910 
okay so let's let's start off with that
to<00:01:17.689> e-flat<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.850> in<00:01:20.119> my<00:01:20.240> base<00:01:20.590> also<00:01:21.590> have<00:01:21.770> that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
to e-flat is in my base also have that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:34.200 
to e-flat is in my base also have that
octave<00:01:22.340> G<00:01:23.859> flat<00:01:25.390> B<00:01:26.390> flat<00:01:26.420> E<00:01:27.140> flat<00:01:29.200> first<00:01:30.200> two

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.650 

five

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.450 

so<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> flat<00:01:41.550> E<00:01:42.120> flat<00:01:42.480> G<00:01:43.110> flat<00:01:43.830> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so you have a a flat E flat G flat in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.219 
so you have a a flat E flat G flat in
your<00:01:44.610> left<00:01:44.850> hand<00:01:45.110> your<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.320> hand<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.770> have

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
your left hand your right hand you have

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.859 
your left hand your right hand you have
C<00:01:49.229> E<00:01:49.880> flat<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:52.440> an<00:01:52.620> A<00:01:52.770> flat<00:01:53.390> alright<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
C E flat and an A flat alright so that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:04.030 
C E flat and an A flat alright so that
was<00:01:59.540> one<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.460> play

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
was one you can play

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.310 
was one you can play
d<00:02:04.820> flat<00:02:05.120> base<00:02:05.450> octave<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.970> then<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.780> basic

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
d flat base octave and then just a basic

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:21.940 
d flat base octave and then just a basic
D<00:02:09.830> flat<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.430> F<00:02:11.170> B<00:02:12.170> flat<00:02:14.620> D<00:02:15.620> flat<00:02:15.650> okay<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
D flat for F B flat D flat okay so this

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.430 
D flat for F B flat D flat okay so this
is<00:02:22.190> good

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.550 

that's<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:31.920> five<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.400> gonna<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.700> here

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
that's you to your five is gonna be here

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
G flat B flat C and F 5 and then for the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.970 
G flat B flat C and F 5 and then for the
final<00:03:15.989> core<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.000> gonna<00:03:18.120> lower<00:03:18.629> their<00:03:19.110> G

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
final core you just gonna lower their G

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.820 
final core you just gonna lower their G
flat

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
flat

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.300 
flat
so<00:03:22.370> what<00:03:22.490> else

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:34.280 

okay<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:27.050> that<00:03:27.230> whole<00:03:27.410> path<00:03:27.680> sounds<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:28.190> this

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.640 

one<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:36.540> kind<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> fill<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.170> out<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.349> little<00:03:37.500> bit

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
one to kind of fill it out a little bit

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.580 
one to kind of fill it out a little bit
I<00:03:38.069> have<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.790> D<00:03:39.060> flat<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.719> the<00:03:39.870> base<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.409> might

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I have that D flat on the base you might

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.360 
I have that D flat on the base you might
not<00:03:40.769> be<00:03:40.859> able<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.069> see<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:41.670> here<00:03:43.159> to<00:03:44.159> D

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
not be able to see this right here to D

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.599 
not be able to see this right here to D
flat<00:03:44.579> then<00:03:45.569> I<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.019> could<00:03:46.590> put<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.280> flat

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
flat then I I could put that a flat

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.170 
flat then I I could put that a flat
