to<00:00:07.980> grimmspeed<00:00:08.460> pieces<00:00:09.150> came<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.020> I

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
to grimmspeed pieces came in today and I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.690 
to grimmspeed pieces came in today and I
got<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:12.020> oil<00:00:13.020> cap<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> battery<00:00:14.370> tie<00:00:14.520> down

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
got the oil cap and battery tie down

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.450 
got the oil cap and battery tie down
better<00:00:15.690> tie<00:00:15.930> down<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> oil<00:00:16.890> cap<00:00:17.130> are<00:00:17.340> both

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
better tie down and the oil cap are both

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.140 
better tie down and the oil cap are both
made<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.200> like<00:00:19.200> cnc<00:00:19.650> aluminum<00:00:20.150> pretty

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
made out of like cnc aluminum pretty

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.320 
made out of like cnc aluminum pretty
beefy<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.630> little<00:00:21.869> bit<00:00:21.990> weighty<00:00:22.200> parts<00:00:22.590> but

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
beefy a little bit weighty parts but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.100 
beefy a little bit weighty parts but
should<00:00:24.330> hold<00:00:24.600> up<00:00:24.780> over<00:00:25.050> time<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:27.110> design

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
should hold up over time and the design

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.690 
should hold up over time and the design
on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.380> ends<00:00:28.620> of<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> grimmspeed<00:00:29.100> battery

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
on the ends of the grimmspeed battery

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.920 
on the ends of the grimmspeed battery
town<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.360> cool<00:00:30.510> they're<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
town and are kind of cool they're like a

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.549 
town and are kind of cool they're like a
piston<00:00:31.290> shape<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.989> back<00:00:33.989> side<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.379> pretty

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
piston shape the back side is pretty

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
piston shape the back side is pretty
plain<00:00:35.300> should<00:00:36.300> clear<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> battery<00:00:36.870> pretty

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
plain should clear the battery pretty

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
plain should clear the battery pretty
well<00:00:37.289> and<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.100> job<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.370> holding<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
well and do a good job of holding it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
well and do a good job of holding it
down<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:40.410> look<00:00:40.680> nice<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.990> oil<00:00:42.990> cap<00:00:43.440> actually

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
down and look nice the oil cap actually

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.990 
down and look nice the oil cap actually
has<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.430> huge<00:00:45.079> gasket<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.380> pouring<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.790> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
has a huge gasket on it pouring so it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
has a huge gasket on it pouring so it
should<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.360> pretty<00:00:48.480> leak<00:00:49.050> proof<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
should be pretty leak proof and it's a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
should be pretty leak proof and it's a
pretty<00:00:51.000> simple<00:00:51.270> design<00:00:51.630> but<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> goal<00:00:54.620> touch

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
pretty simple design but the goal touch

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.319 
pretty simple design but the goal touch

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
stamping so but steel stamping might

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.569 
stamping so but steel stamping might
actually<00:01:26.780> weigh<00:01:27.200> about<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.829> same<00:01:27.979> as<00:01:28.399> the

okay here's the 86 oil cap looks good
looks<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:44.149> lot<00:01:44.239> better<00:01:44.390> than<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.720> crappy

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
looks a lot better than that crappy

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.089 
looks a lot better than that crappy
plastic<00:01:45.319> piece<00:01:45.739> and<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:47.500> did<00:01:48.500> hit<00:01:48.739> a<00:01:48.770> snag

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
plastic piece and I did hit a snag

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.240 
plastic piece and I did hit a snag
though<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.880> battery<00:01:50.179> tie<00:01:50.360> down<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:52.039> looks

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
though the battery tie down it looks

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.109 
though the battery tie down it looks
great<00:01:52.549> on<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:53.209> side<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.920> bolt<00:01:55.579> sticks<00:01:55.939> up

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
great on this side the bolt sticks up

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.510 
great on this side the bolt sticks up
just<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.390> little<00:01:56.539> bit<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:57.079> look<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.560> I've

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
just a little bit but look at that I've

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.669 
just a little bit but look at that I've
got<00:01:58.759> almost<00:01:58.970> an<00:01:59.179> inch<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.840> bolt<00:02:00.170> sticking<00:02:00.500> on

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
got almost an inch of bolt sticking on

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.459 
got almost an inch of bolt sticking on
so<00:02:00.890> what<00:02:01.039> I'm<00:02:01.130> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:02.200> cut<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.409> off

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
so what I'm going to do is cut that off

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.529 
so what I'm going to do is cut that off
shorten<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:04.659> so<00:02:05.659> both<00:02:05.810> sides<00:02:05.869> match<00:02:07.539> you

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
shorten it up so both sides match you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.479 
shorten it up so both sides match you
could<00:02:08.720> probably<00:02:08.989> buy<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.530> rod<00:02:09.920> that's<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.280> little

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
could probably buy a rod that's a little

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.330 
could probably buy a rod that's a little
bit<00:02:10.610> shorter<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:12.010> i'm<00:02:13.010> just<00:02:13.099> going<00:02:13.310> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
bit shorter but i'm just going to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.860 
bit shorter but i'm just going to
shorten<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:13.730> up<00:02:13.819> with<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> dremel<00:02:14.299> tool<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
shorten it up with a dremel tool and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.009 
shorten it up with a dremel tool and
that'll<00:02:15.560> be<00:02:15.650> right<00:02:15.829> back<00:02:16.030> okay<00:02:17.030> all<00:02:17.510> evened<00:02:17.900> up

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
that'll be right back okay all evened up

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.509 
that'll be right back okay all evened up
nice<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.739> tidy<00:02:20.230> down<00:02:21.230> good<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.530> tight<00:02:21.650> not
