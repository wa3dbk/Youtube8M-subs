00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.540
 by boys or girls as they are 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.420
 welcome to a new tutorial the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.000
 big by magnet and today we are here in my 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.240
 desk to teach them how to 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.710
 change the java version that they have 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.450
 you to version 7 point and peak 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.170
 I'm going to specify exactly 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.380
 which 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.650
 because it's the perfect version 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.670
 with minecraft and more specifically with 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.430
 the version of this version helps that 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 walk the forge in our computer 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.790
 well let's go to the link that I'm going to 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.440
 leave in the description of the video 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.110
 let's go to our preferred browser 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.010
 in my case the google chrome 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.790
 We authorize you to wait for us to open 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.950
 and we copy the link 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.610
 or directly you click on the the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.739
 description and ready 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.260
 and this one and he sent us directly to the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.420
 java page and the first thing we're going to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.570
 have here is the version that we're going to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.400
 download that is 7.75 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.260
 well after this we're going to see you 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.170
 we accept license 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.660
 and we're going to look for it from our version the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.760
 of the version of our computer by 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:33.440
 example mine this windows 86 that 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.950
 would come to be 32 bits and if they have 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.040
 from 64 bits they give to the office for 64 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.320
 if not there they are and we are going to 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 look have this this what we have 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.610
 here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.280
 to give here 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.830
 We hope that you download 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 downloading 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.290
 well let's wait for them to download 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.290
 little ones 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.590
 while it is finished downloading 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.590
 we are doing the following 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.890
 we will give you control 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.630
 here we are going to click on panel 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.210
 control will be easier 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 let's go where it says uninstall a 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.160
 Program 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.690
 and from there we will look for the java program 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.510
 here is I gave the jack with the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.140
 amount with the keyboard of finding java 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.210
 of java 8 640 is what I have 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.640
 we give you a right click and we're going to 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.310
 give them uninstall we give you yes 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.840
 we wait 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 and it will start to uninstall 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.870
 here are two good programs left either 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.120
 digital action here it would seem that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.269
 they want installer java and there they can if 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.930
 they want to see what version has already we can 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.930
 do this 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.379
 Now we have to wait for the end of 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.170
 read this meanwhile this is already 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.620
 discharge 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.620
 we go 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.160
 Y 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.160
 we have it here 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.940
 sometimes it ends up downloading 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.350
 let's check it 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.930
 we press 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.470
 j 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.650
 is already eliminated perfect 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.840

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.760
 right execute as administrator 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 with that they felt that is for 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.970
 choose you the folder where you will go 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.170
 to stop the hub but I install it 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.670
 directly 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.209
 it is installed by default 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.180
 now let's wait for it to be finished 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.349
 well, and it 's ending, let's see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.349

 well, this is what the police 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.719
 have installed and it's like this every time I think 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.330
 that every time they turn on the computer 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:35.240
 they will skip a notice to update 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.669
 java but they do not have to do it if not 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.439
 the same error will happen to you 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.419
 error that when installed in the forge 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:44.389
