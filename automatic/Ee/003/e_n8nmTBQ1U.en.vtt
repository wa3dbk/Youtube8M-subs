00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello everyone you sang this 102 fourth 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.490
 part of mine craft mechanisms welcome 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.860
 I will show you this part 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.930
 a wonderful piston door you say 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.090
 bought 5 piston door but it 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.980
 special piston door as you see on 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.890
 little more actually the scheme is not so 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.800
 same big just put the scenery here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.140
 Now I will show you exactly how it works 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.570
 this scheme, look carefully we 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.270
 come to the door it opens we 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.220
 we pass ourselves quietly and she leaves 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.020
 closes behind us when we come to 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.060
 her again 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.250
 she opens we go through and she 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.490
 closes after some amount 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.900
 time is all not a timer and nothing 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.270
 such a scheme here for example looks 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.150
 small basically no more 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 the circuit is not here in fact this 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.430
 scheme if anyone found out this is a piston door 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.130
 which showed in 97 parts of the mechanism 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.280
 maynkravt there is a scheme 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.490
 these are just piston doors of 97 parts 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.320
 you can see this very mechanism 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.400
 that is a great piston door is better and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.090
 the very thing that is she is flat she and the 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.960
 compact 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.820
 Now she is just all that is necessary but 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.010
 based on this we just remove 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.750
 lever and make a scheme with which 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.450
 we will approach her and she will 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.900
 open it up now you 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.500
 by the way you will see my mechanical chip 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.729
 the world which is proud now comes 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.140
 the night was almost here and through 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.760
 some amount of time again 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 including the day although the mechanism here 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.299
 turned on the day the mechanism itself which 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.510
 responsible for this inclusion somewhere over there 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.280
 Yes, it looks like this 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.710
 okay proceed to the mechanism 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.930
 sorry distracted here the whole scheme 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.210
 becomes as you understood on command 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.869
 block 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.810
 command test for dog n i mean player 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.720
 and bracketed brackets radius 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.879
 equal to the number of blocks of radius i 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 chose the perfect for me 6 that is 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.170
 perfect for this door for others 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.960
 mechanism you can this circuit by the way 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.180
 what else 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 said said you can connect this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.140
 circuit with other mechanisms i.e. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 for example, he will approach the soul 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.600
 turn on go to the piston door 3 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.840
 on 3 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.000
 there radius will need more or give 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 many many many many many all 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 Buns can be made from this mechanism 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.210
 so here so here the sensor is built then 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 there we do on both sides 1 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.230
 comparators here are comparator output either 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.140
 here as you are comfortable and put here 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 what's in compact here the thing is that 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 when this one here works 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.500
 see how I would put this command what 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.440
 assign test for this test and test 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.670
 test yes understandable dog 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.240
 player is a test 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.190
 player and insert a radius that is like 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.870
 this unit command unit he will 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 check if you are in 3 blocks from 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.330
 command block ie it is a sensor 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.220
 just just the sensor is understandable by 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.350
 the title of the video is what we just like 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.970
 command block it is activated however 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.190
 as you see my mechanism is not 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.640
 activated that is, it will now turn on 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.220
 is always 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.880
 that's the thing is we have to this very 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.210
 funnel load one block this from us 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.360
 will be 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.270
 bedbug maker pulse generator 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.090
 it doesn't matter in itself 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.430
 the command block will not check then 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.230
 there is he only checks for player availability 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.410
 when a signal is sent to the command block 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.150
 so we make a pulse generator 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.550
 send it to the command block and 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.530
 command block as you can see already begin 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.050
 work that is, it is to check whether we are 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.420
 here we go we go out see the signal 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.640
 works completely that is based 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.350
 on this why exactly 6 radius you can 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.260
 become any radius absolutely that is 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.640
 let's say radius is 20 block now 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.500
 look not fly away and the signal goes out I 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.840
 I fly up the signal turns on that is 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.690
 radius is completely customizable 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.940
 that can not be can not just not 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.900
 please so now I'll show you how 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.260
 by itself 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.870
 This scheme is built. I attached this scheme. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.830
 2 ring usual piston just for 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.890
 an example 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.050
 now i will show you i mean i dig here 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.580
 the block that is exactly his 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.940
 the door itself is two blocks here are three more 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.400
 here 2 and here I dig one 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.690
 command block 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.750
 then I will leave the comparator comparator 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.000
 hopper aimed at each other 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.880
 load it one block any well that is 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.300
 any trying to drive here 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.790
 command and our scheme is already working on 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:12.180
 Essentially we continue to stand here repeater 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:15.480
 here torch block torch block torch 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.510
 here we put a repeater to redstone 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.330
 did not rest on well so we did not diet 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.400
 put the fact is that although you can 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.170
 so put in essence but here should 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.930
 there must be a delay so there must be 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.390
 repeater here and so the circuit 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.040
 works when we depart 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.430
 the circuit doesn't work when we come to 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.590
 the scheme starts the mechanism 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.780
 wonderful just i 'm talking to now 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.080
 such a wonderful mechanism on 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.360
 in fact very much delighted me 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.460
 when I just found out about this command and 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.960
 when built this door itself that is 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.720
 see as if the door is absolutely absolutely 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.600
 cool smoothly we are suitable 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.550
 she opens we go in and she is behind us 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.350
 closes of course we come later 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.570
 back and it opens back 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.400
 perfect radius like i said for this 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.860
 door 6 however you can customize it 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.470
 and that's all the guys here is such a mechanism 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.560
 my door was built of 97 parts 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.210
 mechanism in my and this one here is the sensor 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.630
 movements this is the part that is 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.580
 such a mechanism is just perfect 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.390
 it can be used in many things in 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.510
 traps 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.430
 I will show of course an example of good traps 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.490
 for this mechanism but i think you yourself 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.440
 you can guess at all on this 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.740
 thank you all for watching it was 102 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.990
 The fourth part of the mechanism of Minecraft with 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.670
 you were singing, I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.870
 put this mechanism please 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.870
 thumbs up and good luck to everyone all the best
