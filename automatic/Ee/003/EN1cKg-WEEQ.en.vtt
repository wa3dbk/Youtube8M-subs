00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello guys then as I wrote in 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.070
 my group started step by step or 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.779
 and touring and lloyd pooling this practice 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.789
 wonderful that I had discovered 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.830
 many years ago when he made a 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.589
 seminar of psychologist infection with the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.630
 doctor sea not mengoni is a nod 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.939
 just to restart this practice every 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.339
 morning then who knows how come I put it 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.710
 in the drawer and lollo di milo proprio 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.570
 own monster or forgotten turning 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.110
 so between forum and community and so on 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.550
 etc 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.010
 I returned to the hand questoil 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.800
 pooling I started a week ago 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.500
 about what it means 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.120
 means inserting the oil inside 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.920
 of the mouth and begin to make of 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.879
 shoppy just with oil then 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.340
 push the own oil hard 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.649
 rinse your mouth with oil then 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.140
 two important things 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.850
 the first must be done to all 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.699
 mornings before washing darren that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.980
 before eating foods then fasting 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.840
 if we can't make it anyway 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.550
 place a nice spoon in the mouth of 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.549
 oil can bother me for example 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.060
 da fasti that makes me just that tells a 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.700
 a dog and therefore can give that annoyance 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.229
 though after a very short time anyway 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.009
 we get used to it immediately we can do it 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.159
 in the evening it is always far away however from 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.229
 from meals then what it is like and how to do it 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.840
 and what it is for, as they always are 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.149
 fast then I must take 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.890
 more golds if we want a seed oil than 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.829
 organic sunflower a coconut oil 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 also and not correctly they do not cost 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.729
 as the other oils combine a 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.579
 little more, however, in short, there is 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.560
 want before finishing or boiled 750 ml 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.310
 of oil that you take a nice spoon 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.810
 from kitchen to soup and put on 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.009
 inside the mouth and it starts 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.590
 own ash buy this practice ok 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.170
 it should last about 5 6 minutes if there is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.570
 we do is also indicated ten minutes 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.119
 but it's really hard for the good ones 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.220
 received, I can't do it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.200
 let's start rinsing we feel right 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.930
 that the oil mixes with ours 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 saliva until it becomes a foam in 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.040
 that moment there we feel that we are 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 thickened everything that is all joined to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.080
 saliva 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.540
 we obviously study in the sink 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.920
 you see, however, that it is a color 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.780
 milky almost foamy then e 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160
 marry everything and then rinse 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.530
 the mouth with a nice glass of water 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.720
 in a warm warm 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.920
 then what this practice does is 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.800
 wonderful 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.600
 I started doing it myself sarah who has 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.730
 a placebo effect where you can do it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.230
 all these things that are natural 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.380
 they can still do damage without having to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.510
 buy things already done and I feel 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.440
 well i like it leaves me this mouth 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.140
 beautiful practically an oil 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.780
 collects all the bacteria we keep 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.570
 in the mouth you know well that to have gods 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.400
 bacteria in the mouth means ours 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.800
 organism is but it is only the tooth 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.750
 I usually get sick when I am 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.910
 gums bleed fortunately 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.980
 very few times I have something in mine 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.680
 organism that is not good for example the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.900
 manage if you offer cystitis or 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.880
 other symptoms of inflammation a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 bowel maybe I don't have one 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.910
 so inflamed moment usually in 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.650
 parallel ignites me he calls 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.640
 my mouth and when I brush my teeth 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.400
 they are milan 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.500
 pay attention to this thing because to wash 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.810
 good teeth and keep a political mouth 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.350
 also means having a health of 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.709
 body 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.650
 ok so start doing this 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.450
 oil practice is also found in 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.850
 that now if I can I will write it on 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.270
 under 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.130
 just says that this practice 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.410
 attached to a particular bacterium that 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.140
 it is also the cause of intestinal problems 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.340
 of physical ailments of arthritic pain 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 etc 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.570
 then think a bit only to 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.240
 morning making a nice chapeau with 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.180
 oil a nice mouth wash how many 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.220
 things we can cure don't panic 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.260
 if the idea of ​​putting oil in the mouth at 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.830
 morning actually does not excite 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.450
 we all repeat to myself the first two 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.850
 I couldn't do it for three days 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.470
 had to respect almost immediately though 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.330
 slowly to those who do not make it 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.920
 begins in small doses starts from 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.080
 half a teaspoon with a teaspoon with 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.240
 half a spoon then a spoon gradually 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.210
 day after day you will see that all 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.080
 a habit if you start doing 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.490
 this year with this thing and insert it 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.920
 in your daily habits 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.480
 you will see that within two weeks in 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.580
 then you will find benefits and 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.770
 wonderful I have only after one 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.570
 week I'm already excited about how 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.630
 feel your mouth beautiful clean 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.280
 I'm a fanatic of teeth 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.160
 I keep them pretty white I call myself 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.690
 from me I use the clay face toothpastes from 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.480
 I only do with the toothbrush I use 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.790
 trio in short that disinfects everything 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.090
 really like natural way because it is 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.960
 something that makes me feel good you will see 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.110
 which is something that may seem too 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.450
 stupid but not cured at all 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.810
 in this way as well as when 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.060
 I was talking about intestinal washing 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.780
 it also changes our mind makes you 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.850
