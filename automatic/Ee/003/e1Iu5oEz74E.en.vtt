this supplement which is I don't it's in
my<00:02:01.920> opinion<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> really<00:02:03.000> disappointing

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
my opinion is really disappointing

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
my opinion is really disappointing
because<00:02:03.899> there's<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.560> ratings<00:02:05.040> for

it<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.909> am<00:02:06.479> wondering<00:02:06.509> why<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> ratings<00:02:08.039> are

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it so i am wondering why the ratings are

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.639 
it so i am wondering why the ratings are
the<00:02:08.399> way<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:08.759> are

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
