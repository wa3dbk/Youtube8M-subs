and<00:01:59.119> kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.210> yellows<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> heat

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and kind of yellows on you if you heat

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.730 
and kind of yellows on you if you heat
it<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.829> too<00:02:02.130> much<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:03.320> messy<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> got<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it up too much it's messy you got to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.630 
it up too much it's messy you got to
work<00:02:04.920> quick

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
work quick

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.310 
work quick
sometimes<00:02:07.640> doesn't<00:02:08.090> harden<00:02:08.479> all<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> way<00:02:09.020> and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
sometimes doesn't harden all the way and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.190 
sometimes doesn't harden all the way and
then<00:02:09.470> you've<00:02:09.619> got<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.979> kind<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.190> use<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:11.200> hot-air

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
then you've got to kind of use a hot-air

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.390 
then you've got to kind of use a hot-air
gun<00:02:12.230> like<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:14.260> heat<00:02:15.260> gun<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:15.770> paint<00:02:16.100> stripping

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
gun like a heat gun for paint stripping

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.880 
gun like a heat gun for paint stripping
you<00:02:16.790> know<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> heat<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.660> up<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.050> didn't

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you know and you heat it up and didn't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.580 
you know and you heat it up and didn't
any<00:02:19.010> melt<00:02:19.310> your<00:02:19.490> styrofoam<00:02:19.700> around<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.590> make

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
any melt your styrofoam around and make

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.290 
any melt your styrofoam around and make
sure<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:22.340> use<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.820> stuff<00:02:23.030> make<00:02:23.270> sure

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
sure if you do use that stuff make sure

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.480 
sure if you do use that stuff make sure
you<00:02:23.540> make<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.750> plaster<00:02:24.620> base<00:02:24.830> use<00:02:25.130> though<00:02:25.310> look

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
you make a plaster base use though look

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.000 
you make a plaster base use though look
like<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> plaster<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.330> Paris<00:02:26.660> or<00:02:26.810> something<00:02:27.010> you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
like a plaster of Paris or something you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
like a plaster of Paris or something you
know<00:02:28.100> something<00:02:28.640> good<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.180> solid<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.690> heat

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
know something good and solid and heat

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.570 
know something good and solid and heat
proof<00:02:30.200> type<00:02:30.500> thing<00:02:30.740> before<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.280> pour<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
proof type thing before you pour that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
proof type thing before you pour that
stuff<00:02:32.000> into<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.540> okay<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:35.510> you're<00:02:35.750> using<00:02:35.990> this

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
stuff okay like for instance on a swamp

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.040 
stuff okay like for instance on a swamp
here<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.060> swamp<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.270> I'm<00:02:47.360> starting

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
here on this swamp that I'm starting

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.940 
here on this swamp that I'm starting
here<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.910> syrup<00:02:50.690> helmets<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.680> stuff

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
here you have syrup helmets and stuff

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.340 
here you have syrup helmets and stuff
and<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.580> can<00:02:52.760> pour<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.060> water<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.870> among<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
and you can pour that water in among the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.860

huh<00:02:54.500> max<00:02:54.790> okay<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:59.060> expanding

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
huh max okay that is just the expanding

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.840 
huh max okay that is just the expanding
foam<00:03:00.050> insulation<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.400> wipe<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.730> on

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
foam insulation and you wipe it on

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.620 
foam insulation and you wipe it on
really<00:03:02.570> thin<00:03:02.870> like<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:04.040> know<00:03:04.630> wiped

of<00:03:08.239> an<00:03:08.330> inch<00:03:08.480> thin<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.320> then<00:03:09.860> it'll<00:03:10.070> puff<00:03:10.340> up

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
of an inch thin and then it'll puff up

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.539 
of an inch thin and then it'll puff up
okay<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.750> then<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.110> cooked<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.130> flopped

bottom part here I've poured just did

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.490 
bottom part here I've poured just did
well<00:04:25.310> bond<00:04:25.669> white<00:04:26.000> glue<00:04:26.300> in<00:04:26.509> there<00:04:26.690> which

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
well bond white glue in there which

well bond white glue in there which
dries<00:04:28.220> nice<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.729> clear<00:04:29.060> okay<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.970> works

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
dries nice and clear okay so that works

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
cheap easy type of methods like I said

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.629 
cheap easy type of methods like I said
well<00:05:29.509> bought<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.440> these<00:05:30.800> other<00:05:31.070> ones<00:05:31.400> the

ones<00:05:31.789> that<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.060> pour<00:05:32.360> make<00:05:33.050> sure<00:05:33.259> you<00:05:33.440> have<00:05:33.710> to

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
ones that you pour make sure you have to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.159 
ones that you pour make sure you have to
do<00:05:33.949> it<00:05:34.070> in<00:05:34.250> layers<00:05:34.610> okay<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:35.270> if<00:05:35.570> you're<00:05:35.750> doing

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
do it in layers okay so if you're doing

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.890 
do it in layers okay so if you're doing
a<00:05:36.409> really<00:05:36.590> thick<00:05:36.949> one<00:05:36.979> like<00:05:37.699> this<00:05:37.970> where<00:05:38.659> this

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
a really thick one like this where this

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.070 
a really thick one like this where this
is<00:05:39.729> probably<00:05:40.729> about<00:05:40.849> half<00:05:41.150> an<00:05:41.330> inch<00:05:41.449> three

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
is probably about half an inch three

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.899 
is probably about half an inch three
quarters<00:05:42.380> of<00:05:42.409> an<00:05:42.530> inch<00:05:42.650> in<00:05:42.830> its<00:05:43.009> deepest<00:05:43.669> part

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
quarters of an inch in its deepest part

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.670 
quarters of an inch in its deepest part
you<00:05:44.360> have<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:44.570> pour<00:05:44.870> like<00:05:45.080> an<00:05:45.199> eighth<00:05:45.349> of<00:05:45.530> an

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you have to pour like an eighth of an

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.620 
you have to pour like an eighth of an
inch<00:05:45.830> layer<00:05:46.250> let<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.759> dry<00:05:47.000> overnight

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
inch layer let it dry overnight

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.510 
inch layer let it dry overnight
pour<00:05:48.169> another<00:05:48.409> eighth<00:05:48.680> of<00:05:48.860> an<00:05:48.919> inch<00:05:49.039> let<00:05:49.400> it

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
pour another eighth of an inch let it

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.490 
pour another eighth of an inch let it
dry<00:05:49.729> and<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.000> picks<00:05:50.210> can<00:05:50.570> take<00:05:50.810> a<00:05:50.840> long<00:05:51.169> long

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
dry and it picks can take a long long

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.680 
dry and it picks can take a long long
long<00:05:51.740> time<00:05:51.800> that's<00:05:52.669> where<00:05:52.909> that<00:05:53.030> easy<00:05:53.270> water

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
long time that's where that easy water

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.570 
long time that's where that easy water
stuff<00:05:54.139> is<00:05:54.320> nice<00:05:54.560> but<00:05:54.949> you<00:05:55.159> have<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.430> have<00:05:55.520> a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
stuff is nice but you have to have a

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.310 
stuff is nice but you have to have a
good<00:05:55.789> base<00:05:56.060> with<00:05:56.389> it<00:05:56.570> because<00:05:56.780> if<00:05:56.960> you<00:05:57.050> pour<00:05:57.289> a

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
good base with it because if you pour a

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.830 
good base with it because if you pour a
lot<00:05:57.620> of<00:05:57.969> superheated<00:05:58.969> plastic<00:05:59.509> into

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
lot of superheated plastic into
