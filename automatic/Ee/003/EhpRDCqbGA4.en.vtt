up<00:00:03.270> an<00:00:03.480> area<00:00:03.870> light<00:00:04.259> source<00:00:04.650> within<00:00:05.310> light-up

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
up an area light source within light-up

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.930 
up an area light source within light-up
so<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> very<00:00:07.830> simple<00:00:08.189> box<00:00:09.030> house

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
so here we have a very simple box house

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.650 
so here we have a very simple box house
so<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.059> I'm<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:13.070> set<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.099> some

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
so what I'm going to do is set up some

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.230 
so what I'm going to do is set up some
area<00:00:15.660> lights<00:00:15.870> which<00:00:16.220> as<00:00:17.220> Windows<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.940> sort

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
area lights which as Windows that sort

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.130 
area lights which as Windows that sort
of<00:00:18.300> light<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:20.550> outside<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.900> off

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
of light up the the outside so first off

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160 
of light up the the outside so first off
we're<00:00:22.350> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:23.269> get<00:00:24.269> preferences<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
we're going to get preferences and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380 
we're going to get preferences and
ensure<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.039> new<00:00:26.369> Sun<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> turned<00:00:27.150> off

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
ensure that new Sun is turned off

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.120 
ensure that new Sun is turned off
otherwise<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.619> drown<00:00:28.890> out

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
otherwise it's going to just drown out

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
otherwise it's going to just drown out
all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.460> area<00:00:29.820> lights<00:00:30.029> we're<00:00:30.449> gonna<00:00:30.570> put<00:00:30.779> in

we go
that's<00:01:11.220> done<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> let's<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.090> ahead

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that's done so let's just go right ahead

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's done so let's just go right ahead
and<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> look<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.200> what<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> result

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and have a look and see what the result

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
and have a look and see what the result
of<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> let's<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.939> click<00:01:18.299> direct

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of that is let's do you click direct

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.140 
of that is let's do you click direct
lighting<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.990> Go<00:01:22.290> button<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.009> go

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.030 

so<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.020> lighting<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
so we can see that it's lighting up the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
so we can see that it's lighting up the
lawn<00:01:30.409> out<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.840> spread<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.930> pretty

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
lawn out here it's the spread is pretty

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.520 
lawn out here it's the spread is pretty
wide<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> take<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:36.530> light

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
wide so I'm going to take the light

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.230 
wide so I'm going to take the light
source<00:01:37.770> tool<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.740> come<00:01:40.740> over<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:42.000> light

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
source tool and come over to this light

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050 
source tool and come over to this light
source<00:01:42.420> click<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.640> bring<00:01:44.970> this

source click on it and just bring this
down<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.450> 45<00:01:45.990> degrees<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> an<00:01:47.700> reduce<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
down to 45 degrees so an reduce the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.350 
down to 45 degrees so an reduce the
spread<00:01:49.190> you'll<00:01:50.190> notice<00:01:50.580> these<00:01:50.759> grey<00:01:51.090> lines

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
spread you'll notice these grey lines

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630 
spread you'll notice these grey lines
give<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.840> an<00:01:51.930> indication<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.310> spread<00:01:53.610> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
give it an indication of the spread of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.480 
give it an indication of the spread of
the<00:01:54.119> light

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
the light

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.450 
the light
okay<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.820> let's<00:01:57.360> update<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.960> lighting

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.590 

that's<00:02:02.460> much<00:02:02.670> better<00:02:06.110> okay<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
that's much better okay so that's just

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's much better okay so that's just
simply<00:02:10.319> setting<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.600> area<00:02:12.600> light<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.380> other

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
simply setting up a area light the other

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.490 
simply setting up a area light the other
thing<00:02:13.680> I've<00:02:13.769> got<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.069> here<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:15.500> some

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
thing I've got over here is some

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.110 
thing I've got over here is some
geometry<00:02:16.739> that's<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.580> cylinder<00:02:17.850> I'm

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
geometry that's a little cylinder I'm

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.470 
geometry that's a little cylinder I'm
going<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> turn<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.810> into<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.470> component<00:02:20.480> just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
going to turn that into a component just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140 
going to turn that into a component just
so<00:02:21.660> it's<00:02:21.870> easier<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.739> manipulate<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.700> call<00:02:24.060> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
so it's easier to manipulate and call it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:33.170 
so it's easier to manipulate and call it
spotlight<00:02:27.739> now<00:02:28.739> we're<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:33.000> bring

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
spotlight now we're gonna just bring

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.600 
spotlight now we're gonna just bring
that<00:02:33.239> across<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:36.680> we'll<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:40.400> angle<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.549> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
that across here we'll just angle that a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.270 
that across here we'll just angle that a
little<00:02:41.850> bit<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.709> similar<00:02:50.040> sort<00:02:50.220> of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
little bit and in the similar sort of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.759 
little bit and in the similar sort of
way<00:02:50.370> I'm<00:02:50.519> gonna<00:02:50.730> edit<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.239> component<00:02:51.810> I'm

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
way I'm gonna edit this component I'm

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.599 
way I'm gonna edit this component I'm
gonna<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.579> paint<00:02:54.000> bucket<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.609> we'll

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
gonna get the paint bucket and we'll

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.000 
gonna get the paint bucket and we'll
choose<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> color<00:02:57.329> which<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.630> also<00:02:57.810> pretty<00:02:58.140> cool

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
choose a color which is also pretty cool

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.430 
choose a color which is also pretty cool
color<00:02:59.400> here<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.359> end<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.049> spotlight

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
color here for the end of the spotlight

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.080 
color here for the end of the spotlight
and<00:03:04.739> again<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.820> need<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.359> ensure<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.840> I've

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and again I need to ensure that I've

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
and again I need to ensure that I've
labeled<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:10.049> name<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.590> begins<00:03:11.010> with

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
labeled it with a name that begins with

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.319 
labeled it with a name that begins with
exclamation<00:03:11.670> mark<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.720> light<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:16.500> can

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
exclamation mark so that light up can

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:24.589 
exclamation mark so that light up can
identify<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.670> emitter<00:03:20.670> surface

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.610 

so<00:03:25.599> there<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.900> are<00:03:27.870> let's<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.019> update<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
so there we are let's just update the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.589 
so there we are let's just update the
lighting<00:03:33.150> good<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.140> we<00:03:35.200> have<00:03:35.670> 2<00:03:36.670> mu

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
lighting good so now we have 2 mu

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.080 
lighting good so now we have 2 mu
emitters<00:03:38.019> lighting<00:03:38.739> our<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:42.400> model<00:03:42.549> I'm

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
emitters lighting our little model I'm

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.789 
emitters lighting our little model I'm
going<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.420> narrow<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.959> spread<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.470> again

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
going to narrow the spread of this again

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.470 
going to narrow the spread of this again
so<00:03:45.159> here<00:03:45.640> we<00:03:45.760> take<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:48.090> light<00:03:49.090> source

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
so here we take the the light source

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.910 
so here we take the the light source
tool<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.799> just<00:03:51.010> go<00:03:51.159> in<00:03:51.280> here<00:03:51.579> and<00:03:52.920> we're

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
tool and we just go in here and we're

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920 
tool and we just go in here and we're
going<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.129> just<00:03:54.280> reduce<00:03:54.819> that<00:03:55.239> spread<00:03:55.569> to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
going to just reduce that spread to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.630 
going to just reduce that spread to
something<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.530> little<00:03:56.709> bit<00:03:56.799> smaller<00:03:56.920> say<00:03:57.310> 50

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
something a little bit smaller say 50

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.360 
something a little bit smaller say 50
degrees<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.239> that<00:04:01.420> it's<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.870> little<00:04:01.989> bit

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
degrees just so that it's a little bit

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.119 
degrees just so that it's a little bit
more<00:04:03.370> focused<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:05.290> again<00:04:05.530> update<00:04:06.069> the

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
more focused and again update the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.000 
more focused and again update the
lighting<00:04:08.970> there<00:04:09.970> we<00:04:10.060> go<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:11.530> that's<00:04:11.650> just<00:04:11.920> a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
lighting there we go so that's just a

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.960 
lighting there we go so that's just a
simple<00:04:12.280> example<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.959> setting<00:04:13.959> up<00:04:14.730> area<00:04:15.730> lights

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
simple example of setting up area lights

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.820 
simple example of setting up area lights
within<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.380> light-up<00:04:17.859> plugin<00:04:18.400> for<00:04:18.579> Sketchup
