00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello a little video in which 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.690
 I will explain how to use 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.389
 a knife of this kind that is to say 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 genre normal why the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.660
 hormones actually knives them 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.780
 areas whose specificity to have 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.020
 so a central clamp and to have so 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.710
 accessories so knife pique your 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.480
 calculation then we will see in detail so 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 laterally so on the lateral part 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 of act 1 of the duke besides so here is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.899
 so this famous thinks that sometimes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.280
 will be equipped so with a jaw that these 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.630
 two there for them so used is 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 used as a straight pliers 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.930
 cutting also and so without more and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 we will begin to see what 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.210
 let it be that tonight so articulates 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.640
 around this knife so here is where 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 it's a spade so the knife 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.340
 whose blade of a knife did this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.050
 are fighting knives so 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 use it standards and so in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.070
 the occurrence there is a broken glass 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.019
 so that's not very interesting 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.339
 to have a broken window with a knife and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.659
 so here you have to know that some 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.939
 knife be equipped with a pile like 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.299
 that and if it is so - 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.840
 windows we have here so to find 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 a rare piece the hole in which one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 so can slip an official sheet 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.509
 a little rope and so finally use 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.610
 after eventually planting this 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.290
 so in the soil so used to 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 children to do any 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.850
 instrument here, however, so she 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.470
 so be jury- type now a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.119
 cruciform screwdriver so pretty basic 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.689
 all the knives la zaman 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.329
 we realize that of course it is the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.930
 knife with disdain and fit so they 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.620
 love it in this case very sharp 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:05.320
 and we go to the background 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.660
 second side a file so that's very 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.210
 cool on also in best couple is going 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.960
 poorly followed by gradually cutthroats 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.100
 so is actually called for used 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.670
 in the kitchen for over an hour 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:27.760
 to disembowel disemboweled a fish by 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:32.290
 example and so he has two of your 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.140
 type of screwdriver so flat screwdriver 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:42.010
 a first and a second who have the street 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 and finally a saw so a double saw 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.020
 double led as expect so pretty 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 effective so that's roughly speaking so 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.400
 stopped as these show that his 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.290
 team is so the maternal coteau 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.030
 while knowing so let the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.520
 most common accessories so according to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.700
 the screwdrivers the coy the lime and the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.769
 knife is so had you here demonstrates 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.650
 a bit how to use she was 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.080
 really the face of a road clause of 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.310
 this knife so that's usually 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.580
 Generally speaking, they are knives 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.720
 So for the insured so that in 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.510
 practical since it's not very 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.890
 cumbersome and it embeds more than one 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.410
 ten access axes are scanned 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.239
 nice here so I hope this 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.690
 video was useful and we did not put so 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.360
 to visualize a few uses and 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.040
 the appearance and therefore the technicality of the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.760
 al zaman type knife 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.760
 thank you
