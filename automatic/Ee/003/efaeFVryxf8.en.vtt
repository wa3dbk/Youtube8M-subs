00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.720
 and here just in tune with the episode is our angel chef wanting you use 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.230
 with all his staff he has prepared foods that are exactly 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.230
 corresponding to our Mediterranean diet 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 what is the provider this is an appetizer of grilled vegetables 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.020
 another small ready-made asparagus appetizers are white zucchini leaks in 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.089
 flower 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.399
 with some fresh artichokes 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.950
 pinzimonio 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.090
 it is a spelled salad with legumes 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.910
 main course and spelled salad with nails 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.500
 let's talk about it for a moment because it's the most important dish is what 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.680
 start at the door both fiber and that at the base of our pyramid 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.460
 feed 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.059
 but also starch proteins 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.460
 and that little bit of fat given by olive oil 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.590
 years of proteins are given mainly by protein pupils 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.330
 vegetables that are not not tell you me the animal proteins but in the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 union between legumes, events and grasses, I will also make barley and summarize them 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.899
 perfectly can soufflÃ© avec 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.149
 and in a diet also vegetarian what the protein needs 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.689
 body and our body especially in the case of spelled 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.319
 we can find it from the sibilla city film with march we have spelled 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.170
 whole wheat 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 we have it hard boarding have different cooking times 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.910
 first of all, they must be soaked in clean water 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.230
 maybe change the water we can talk about a 12 hour all night if 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.380
 we are in presence 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.659
 of semi-integrated 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.090
 of 6 or 7 hours if we are in the presence of 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.160
 seeds for you I call a faster cooking time 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 and cooking is done without salt water, I recommend the savory conversation 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 hi do then in albumin was once washed 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.720
 they must be thrown in hot water and then costs until we had it 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.809
 starch gelatinization problem 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.819
 another very important thing 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.840
 performs an accurate foaming because in this way they are removed all 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.550
 impurity 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.949
 ca. they come to the surface the moment we go to cook them 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.479
 another element of these courses of this season above all is 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.350
 asparagus 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 we remind you that there are white asparagus that are welcomed when 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.370
 the asparagus has not yet come out of the ground and therefore remains white and 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.789
 asparagus verbs that instead 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.109
 nicola come keep the green color just because they are collected 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.769
 when this came out completely on the other hand 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.099
 for these vegetables we decided to combine a good glass of lugana ca 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.539
 the aromas they accompany. 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:52.229
 legumes both cooked and culooo of which must always be present in the 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.459
 ours on our table because rabbits are the ones that most 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.659
 maintain antioxidant substances 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.229
 but remember as always that 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:05.609
 throughout the day both at the table and out of the meal hey very important as 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.839
 element of life a great deal away
