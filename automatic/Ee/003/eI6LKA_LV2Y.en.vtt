on my seventh day which is Sunday I'm

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
on my seventh day which is Sunday I'm

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
3,500 calories if you don't know that is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
3,500 calories if you don't know that is
one<00:00:56.699> pound<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.239> fat<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> said<00:00:58.289> we're

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
one pound of fat like I said we're

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
one pound of fat like I said we're
talking<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> terms<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.609> energy<00:01:00.120> balance

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
talking in terms of energy balance

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.260 
talking in terms of energy balance
calories<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> versus<00:01:02.039> calories<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.180> know

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
calories in versus calories out you know

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
calories in versus calories out you know
like<00:01:03.449> those<00:01:03.600> scales<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
like those scales that you see all the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
like those scales that you see all the
time<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.119> energy<00:01:06.630> balance<00:01:06.750> one

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
time think of that in energy balance one

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
time think of that in energy balance one
is<00:01:07.710> weight<00:01:07.950> gain<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.299> weight<00:01:09.510> loss

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is weight gain the other is weight loss

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
is weight gain the other is weight loss
so<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.680> first<00:01:10.890> six<00:01:11.159> days<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.549> lose<00:01:11.909> a

so in those first six days I lose a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
so in those first six days I lose a
pound<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.080> good<00:01:13.290> good<00:01:13.590> job<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you lose some weight and then on that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and kind of bring the scale that I was

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.969 
and kind of bring the scale that I was
talking<00:01:56.280> about<00:01:56.369> back<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> balanced

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
talking about back to more of a balanced

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
talking about back to more of a balanced
or<00:01:59.219> maybe<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.790> as<00:02:00.030> much<00:02:00.210> weight<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> might

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
or maybe not as much weight so you might

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.550 
or maybe not as much weight so you might
gain<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.490> weight<00:02:03.180> back<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
gain a little bit of weight back so I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
gain a little bit of weight back so I
really<00:02:05.040> don't<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> point<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.939> having<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540
