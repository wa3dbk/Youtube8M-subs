 the first fact knows if there would be 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.369
 but the fact is that the lottery of the state of 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.779
 minnesota in the United States has reached 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.300
 consider the idea of ​​leaving people 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.110
 a month to play for 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 right there 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.550
 the scheme would be the following I them 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.360
 park got there and said the team comes from a 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.790
 ticket 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.410
 then bought the ticket rolled ness usa 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.600
 a cartridge made by the company itself 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.650
 to play and beauty, everything would be 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.680
 connected to a central computer 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.320
 through an ok mold it seemed to much 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 simple but the genius plan was not to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.340
 because they were worried 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.670
 with the possibility of minors 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.680
 buy tickets to give some 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.110
 One year we'll cry, this is cool. 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 man I do not know, I know I lost 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.830
 society 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.170
 the goal fact what we now go to 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.100
 the darlings of video games mario 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 bros 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.840
 everybody already knows the sampler males 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.150
 those with less who have car color 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.430
 white like white chicken pox 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 Well you know why I get the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 'said-whose' you increase in size 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.450
 I explain these with old people. 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.240
 are based on the fungus called 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.130
 these funds make the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.630
 people have the feeling that they are 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.909
 growing in size 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.850
 this same effect also had reference 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.220
 in alice in wonderland is mario 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.280
 bros who thought the plumber can 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.890
 use it if you notice in the third fact 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.960
 still talking about mario bros did you know 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.110
 that hat and mustache that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.670
 world loves were not to be there yes the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.880
 Mario's creator wanted him to have 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.280
 hair and a mouth but it turns out he is 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 A little lazy for an Asian he 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.900
 wanted to avoid animal hair and draw a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.970
 character's mouth because he thought that 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.820
 it would be difficult to do this correctly 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.369
 a space so small only that he thought 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.400
 wrong because he's Asian then a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 animated hair in the space of 12 pixels and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.849
 a beautiful mouth is nothing but this does not 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.709
 it matters 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.720
 leaves the husband people he is today 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.349
 because we are already a man anyway 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.159
 fourth fact anyway the subject is now 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.560
 gorillas 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.480
 Have you ever thought about how it would be 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.849
 ride a donkey kong 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 seems like a stupid question but she has 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.590
 foundation 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.750
 yes there is a mistake there in donkey kong 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 country where you while riding in 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.590
 rhino to each mountain in a copy 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.840
 from donkey kong 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.460
 the only difference of the normal Goian by 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.250
 turned into a mount is that the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.110
 pontificate has the rhinoceros 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.480
 maintained by the game which does not change in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.940
 nothing the bizarre fact of you is mounted 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.490
 in yourself and want to know I'll show 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.650
 for you how to do it all happens 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.630
 in the first phase of the game you go 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.880
 following until you pass the check point 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.489
 after you pass the check point 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.190
 will have the renouncer pick him up and come back 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.989
 there at the beginning of the phase you go 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.720
 jump off of one of those trees 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.270
 to be able to unlock the floor on the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.670
 gas cylinder in the same gas cylinder 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.820
 You're going to walk a little bit to the left. 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.730
 and plumb the can and jump quickly 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.680
 on top of it come rolling and when you 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.959
 go through the whistleblower you already ride in 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.120
 him but remembering that it's just for 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.560
 A few moments this works. 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.410
 fifth fact 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.980

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.530

 who says sinister things when his 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.930
 sound in half life 2 when 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.330
