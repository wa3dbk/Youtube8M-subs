00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.330 
biting insects such as the skills and
biting<00:05:12.050> flies<00:05:12.169> so<00:05:12.590> we'll<00:05:12.800> see<00:05:12.980> if<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.070> works

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
biting flies so we'll see if that works

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.270 
biting flies so we'll see if that works
out<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:15.140> that's<00:05:15.380> pretty<00:05:15.500> much<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.740> i'm<00:05:16.100> going

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
out and that's pretty much it i'm going

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.260 
out and that's pretty much it i'm going
to<00:05:16.340> sharpen<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:16.820> puppy<00:05:17.180> up<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:19.120> burn<00:05:20.120> it

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
to sharpen this puppy up and burn it

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.150 
to sharpen this puppy up and burn it
down<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.810> it's<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.200> hard<00:05:21.440> tip

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
down so it's a hard tip

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.500 
down so it's a hard tip
probably<00:05:24.160> get<00:05:24.220> some<00:05:24.400> dinner<00:05:26.130> right<00:05:27.130> now<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.640> got

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
probably get some dinner right now I got

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.020 
probably get some dinner right now I got
like<00:05:28.930> Spears<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:32.430> putting<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.550> near<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:33.730> hot

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
like Spears and putting it near the hot

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.980 
like Spears and putting it near the hot
coals<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.810> burn<00:05:35.320> out<00:05:35.350> all<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:36.300> water<00:05:37.300> it's

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
coals to burn out all the water it's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.230 
coals to burn out all the water it's
contained<00:05:38.350> within<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.770> wood<00:05:39.000> what's<00:05:40.000> that

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
contained within the wood what's that

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.720 
contained within the wood what's that
with<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:40.690> what<00:05:40.870> that<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.170> doing<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:42.460> actually

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
with it what that is doing is actually

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.760 
with it what that is doing is actually
making<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.240> wood<00:05:43.450> harder<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.170> it's<00:05:44.290> making<00:05:44.620> my

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
making the wood harder so it's making my

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.210 
making the wood harder so it's making my
spirit<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.700> harder<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:46.620> won't<00:05:47.620> break<00:05:47.830> that

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
spirit it the harder it won't break that

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.670 
spirit it the harder it won't break that
easy<00:05:48.820> and<00:05:49.300> it<00:05:49.420> will<00:05:49.570> punch<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.990> lot<00:05:50.140> easier<00:05:50.260> as

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
easy and it will punch a lot easier as

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.190 
easy and it will punch a lot easier as
well<00:05:52.770> trick<00:05:53.770> is<00:05:53.920> not<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.160> let<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.430> burn<00:05:55.200> you

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
well trick is not to let it burn you

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.390 
well trick is not to let it burn you
don't<00:05:56.380> want<00:05:56.530> it<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.710> burn<00:05:56.890> because<00:05:57.100> then<00:05:57.310> it

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
don't want it to burn because then it

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.470 
don't want it to burn because then it
turns<00:05:57.580> into<00:05:57.730> charcoal<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:59.080> want<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.440> brown

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
turns into charcoal you want to brown

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.300 
turns into charcoal you want to brown
check<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.630> tip<00:06:01.810> every<00:06:02.050> once<00:06:02.230> in<00:06:02.350> a<00:06:02.410> while<00:06:02.560> sure

check the tip every once in a while sure
it's<00:06:03.460> not<00:06:03.550> burning<00:06:04.080> rounded<00:06:05.080> up<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.410> make

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
it's not burning rounded up and make

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.860 
it's not burning rounded up and make

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
it check a tip sure it's nothing running

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.910 
it check a tip sure it's nothing running
a<00:06:14.860> little<00:06:14.980> bit<00:06:15.190> let<00:06:15.760> me<00:06:15.790> shoot<00:06:16.060> it<00:06:16.210> down<00:06:16.360> again

or even probably a raccoon so I tried to

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.710 
or even probably a raccoon so I tried to
achieve<00:06:52.790> two<00:06:53.120> goals<00:06:53.360> on<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.050> first<00:06:54.320> day<00:06:55.720> make
