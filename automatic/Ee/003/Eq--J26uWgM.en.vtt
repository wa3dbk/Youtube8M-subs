 it will go to the face in addition to aliens or almost it's our work but 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.249
 what an idea to go sit

 the two of foot burning sarthe we do not find a tipi village 

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:22.200

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.110
 to live with nature 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.450
 like Native Americans it is the choice of vacationers 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.030

 among the tourists christel avoid a couple of lovebirds who are celebrating their 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.910
 ten years of marriage 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.929
 when you're out in the open for a discovery to retrain 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.219
 that's something we did not know at all about laughing the future 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.170
 help 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 but from the opposite view we chose and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.020
 these areas 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.700
 the pursuit of inherent risk taking must be aimed at best 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 target in positions sometimes a spokesperson 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.960
 the javelin of the guys easier sometimes thomas hobbes it remains a test 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.320
 who sneered find the answers 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.299
 but in a profession teepee after this encampment almost ten years ago 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.490
 no Native American roots he had the love at first sight we do not know that the team 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.380
 keeping regular contacts 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.820
 we have established really for the time being the most original the most 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.010
 Native Americans too 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.540
 they are in the montana the few planes the mayor of quebec as best 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.520
 actually also on the trips back and forth which allows precisely 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.710

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.190
 the current government m 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.010
 the transfer 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.600
 it's very nice 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.820
 perhaps 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.690
 the evening meal Native American cuisine guaranteed recipes kept secret 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.139
 it's very successful 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.260
 it's very different from what we can eat through sin never eat 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.700
 healthy 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700
 these are people vision balls 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 with the name of a Native American tribe 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.799

 by then but they are no longer there 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:46.039
 to but a night in a crash involving two people starts at 55 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.189
 euros in low season the others will boast his merits think

 come back on a bike2 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 despite a vehicle in which I think weir 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.729
 around the world it's really something to make an effort 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.810
 the great minds awake on this valley 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.679
