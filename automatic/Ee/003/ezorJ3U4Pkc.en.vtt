but I miss and that really sucks and
that's<00:01:56.189> gonna<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.520> extremely<00:01:56.880> catastrophic

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's gonna be extremely catastrophic

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.060 
that's gonna be extremely catastrophic
for<00:01:57.899> me<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> beginnings<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> match

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
for me in the beginnings of the match

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.370 
for me in the beginnings of the match
now<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.820> gonna<00:02:00.090> bring<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.479> Zeb<00:02:00.750> Stryker<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
now I'm gonna bring in my Zeb Stryker I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.990 
now I'm gonna bring in my Zeb Stryker I
think<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> choice<00:02:02.310> scarf<00:02:02.610> hidden<00:02:02.880> power

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
think the choice scarf hidden power

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300 
think the choice scarf hidden power
grass<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.540> too<00:02:03.869> obvious<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> didn't<00:02:05.130> want

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
grass is too obvious so I didn't want

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.069 
grass is too obvious so I didn't want
him<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> go<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:05.969> jumpluff<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.570> met<00:02:06.750> tank<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
him to go into jumpluff or met tank to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.290 
him to go into jumpluff or met tank to
take<00:02:07.200> advantage<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:09.090> why<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
take advantage of that so that's why I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029 
take advantage of that so that's why I
went<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> thunderbolt<00:02:10.200> however<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.739> end

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
went for the thunderbolt however I end

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.680 
went for the thunderbolt however I end
up<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.670> predicting<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> he's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
up over predicting and he's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.540 
up over predicting and he's
gonna<00:02:12.810> take<00:02:12.960> me<00:02:13.020> down<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.890> earth<00:02:14.280> power

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
gonna take me down with a earth power

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.550 
gonna take me down with a earth power
and<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.850> sucks<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.420> reason<00:02:15.990> why<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> went<00:02:16.410> for

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and that sucks the reason why I went for

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.470 
and that sucks the reason why I went for
the<00:02:16.650> thunderbolt<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.220> because<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.420> would

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the thunderbolt is because it would

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.180 
the thunderbolt is because it would
allow<00:02:18.750> me<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.170> control<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.710> match<00:02:19.890> since

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
allow me to have control the match since

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.980 
allow me to have control the match since
it<00:02:20.400> would<00:02:20.490> nail<00:02:21.150> him<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.510> he<00:02:21.570> decided<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
it would nail him if he decided to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.070 
it would nail him if he decided to
switch<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:23.460> bad<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:24.150> uh<00:02:24.180> he<00:02:24.840> takes

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
switch and it's bad because uh he takes

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.200 
switch and it's bad because uh he takes
me<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.710> really<00:02:26.160> he<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.490> full<00:02:26.790> control<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
me out and really he has full control of

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.490 
me out and really he has full control of
the<00:02:27.300> match<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.480> far<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.050> that's<00:02:28.170> terrible

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the match so far and that's terrible

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.320 
the match so far and that's terrible
because<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.890> hyper<00:02:29.190> offensive<00:02:29.700> team<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.120> mine

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
because a hyper offensive team like mine

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.630 
because a hyper offensive team like mine
really<00:02:31.050> does<00:02:31.380> rely<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.770> having<00:02:32.250> total<00:02:32.610> control

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
really does rely on having total control

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
really does rely on having total control
of<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.150> match<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.350> I'm<00:02:34.560> pretty<00:02:34.710> much

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
of the match so now I'm pretty much

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
of the match so now I'm pretty much
forced<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:35.460> into<00:02:35.490> my<00:02:35.790> B<00:02:36.000> hey<00:02:36.210> M<00:02:36.390> or<00:02:36.630> I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
forced to go into my B hey M or I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.930 
forced to go into my B hey M or I
totally<00:02:37.470> butchered<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.800> name<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.790> I'm

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
totally butchered that name but I'm

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.670 
totally butchered that name but I'm
gonna<00:02:39.120> go<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> psychic<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> reason

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
gonna go for the psychic and the reason

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
gonna go for the psychic and the reason
why<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.340> hesitant<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.570> earlier

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
why I was hesitant to do that earlier

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480 
why I was hesitant to do that earlier
was<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.620> didn't<00:02:43.890> want<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.070> lock<00:02:44.280> myself

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
was because I didn't want to lock myself

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.490 
was because I didn't want to lock myself
into<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.150> psychic<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:45.840> he<00:02:46.080> does<00:02:46.260> have

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
into that psychic because he does have

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.070 
into that psychic because he does have
that<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.880> met<00:02:48.090> tang<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.540> by<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.750> way<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that that met tang and by the way that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.440 
that that met tang and by the way that
was<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> choice<00:02:49.530> backs<00:02:49.860> p.m.<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.360> go

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
was a choice backs p.m. I'm gonna go

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.210 
was a choice backs p.m. I'm gonna go
into<00:02:51.630> muck<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.020> take<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.320> fake<00:02:52.500> out<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.950> then

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
into muck to take the fake out and then

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.730 
into muck to take the fake out and then
I'm<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.640> go<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.240> brick<00:02:54.480> break

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
I'm just gonna go for the brick break

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'm just gonna go for the brick break
anticipating<00:02:55.740> him<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.950> go<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.310> taunt<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
anticipating him to go for the taunt and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.610 
anticipating him to go for the taunt and
the<00:02:56.790> reason<00:02:57.090> why<00:02:57.300> I'm<00:02:57.930> thinking<00:02:58.350> he's<00:02:58.470> going

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the reason why I'm thinking he's going

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.110 
the reason why I'm thinking he's going
to<00:02:58.710> go<00:02:58.800> for<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.100> taunt<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.490> opposed<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to go for the taunt as opposed to the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.110 
to go for the taunt as opposed to the
u-turn<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.660> because<00:03:01.380> after<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> set<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
u-turn is because after I set up a a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.590 
u-turn is because after I set up a a
curse<00:03:04.080> he<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.470> doesn't<00:03:04.650> have<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.920> reliable

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
curse he really doesn't have a reliable

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.000 
curse he really doesn't have a reliable
counter<00:03:06.600> other<00:03:06.870> than<00:03:07.140> his<00:03:07.230> jumpluff<00:03:07.710> but

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
counter other than his jumpluff but

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.920 
counter other than his jumpluff but
really<00:03:08.730> that's<00:03:08.850> not<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.300> great<00:03:09.570> counter

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
really that's not really a great counter

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
really that's not really a great counter
because<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.740> do<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.100> pretty<00:03:11.370> much<00:03:11.520> put

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
because all I can do is pretty much put

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750 
because all I can do is pretty much put
me<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.970> sleep<00:03:12.120> however<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:13.410> /<00:03:14.250> uglies<00:03:14.580> just

to the brick breaks so he's gonna have

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330 
to the brick breaks so he's gonna have
that<00:03:21.600> opportunity<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.500> set<00:03:22.709> up<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.890> hone<00:03:23.040> clause

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the beginning of the match so this is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.400 
the beginning of the match so this is
terrible<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.940> he's<00:03:51.810> gonna<00:03:51.989> predict<00:03:52.350> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
terrible and he's gonna predict the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.410 
terrible and he's gonna predict the
obvious<00:03:52.739> earthquake<00:03:53.190> by<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:54.030> was<00:03:54.300> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
obvious earthquake by here this was the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.240 
obvious earthquake by here this was the
turning<00:03:54.660> point<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.110> match<00:03:55.140> I'm<00:03:55.739> going<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
turning point of the match I'm going to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.850 
turning point of the match I'm going to
protect<00:03:56.700> his<00:03:57.120> switch<00:03:57.450> back<00:03:57.959> into<00:03:58.140> matang<00:03:58.620> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
protect his switch back into matang and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.640 
protect his switch back into matang and
I'm<00:03:59.190> gonna<00:03:59.310> go<00:03:59.580> for<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.420> earthquake<00:04:01.019> before<00:04:01.620> I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
I'm gonna go for the earthquake before I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.449 
I'm gonna go for the earthquake before I
die<00:04:01.890> from<00:04:02.519> poison<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:04.140> was<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.590> very<00:04:05.160> very

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
die from poison and that was a very very

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.100 
die from poison and that was a very very
great<00:04:05.640> play<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.690> he<00:04:06.780> stayed<00:04:07.080> in

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
great play because if he stayed in

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.890 
great play because if he stayed in
obviously<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.130> would<00:04:08.370> have<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:09.450> know<00:04:09.480> not

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
obviously it would have you know not

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.440 
obviously it would have you know not
worked<00:04:10.110> at<00:04:10.260> all<00:04:10.440> but<00:04:10.830> uh<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:12.209> was<00:04:12.300> just

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
worked at all but uh that was just

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.020 
worked at all but uh that was just
amazing<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.530> was<00:04:13.800> able<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.550> go

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
amazing that I was able to you know go

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.880 
amazing that I was able to you know go
for<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.330> second<00:04:15.840> earthquake<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.530> nearly

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
for that second earthquake and nearly

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.990 
for that second earthquake and nearly
take<00:04:17.160> him<00:04:17.310> out<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.519> I<00:04:17.549> can<00:04:17.700> revenge

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
take him out and I can revenge

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.479 
take him out and I can revenge
kilonewton<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.930> was<00:04:19.590> pretty<00:04:19.890> sure<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.100> can<00:04:20.310> take

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
kilonewton I was pretty sure I can take

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.070 
kilonewton I was pretty sure I can take
him<00:04:20.640> out<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> choice<00:04:21.210> banded<00:04:21.479> extreme

sliver of health and he does go for

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.480 
sliver of health and he does go for
toxic<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.419> if<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.750> was<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.410> belly<00:04:28.860> drumming<00:04:29.250> set

I could have been able to you know swept

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.629 
I could have been able to you know swept
is<00:04:33.810> sweep<00:04:34.139> esteem<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:35.099> course<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:35.550> a

choice band set and the reason why I

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.920 
choice band set and the reason why I
like<00:04:37.199> choice<00:04:37.500> band<00:04:37.770> /<00:04:38.310> belly<00:04:38.699> drum<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.210> because

like choice band / belly drum is because

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.830 
like choice band / belly drum is because

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
uh it's a very it has a surprise factor

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
boost so I'm gonna just go for the gunk

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.490 
boost so I'm gonna just go for the gunk
shot<00:06:23.310> and<00:06:23.550> try<00:06:23.669> to<00:06:23.729> take<00:06:23.940> him<00:06:24.090> out<00:06:24.210> but<00:06:24.569> he<00:06:25.289> has

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:29.219 
a trick up his sleeve and he has the

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.939 
a trick up his sleeve and he has the
substitute<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.180> that<00:06:30.750> just<00:06:31.139> you<00:06:31.500> know<00:06:31.650> that

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
substitute and that just you know that

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.279 
substitute and that just you know that
was<00:06:32.099> ridiculous<00:06:32.789> a<00:06:32.940> very<00:06:33.389> very<00:06:33.750> great<00:06:33.960> play<00:06:34.259> on

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
was ridiculous a very very great play on

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.640 
was ridiculous a very very great play on
xenon<00:06:34.860> spark<00:06:35.219> because<00:06:35.870> with<00:06:36.870> substitute<00:06:37.440> he's

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
xenon spark because with substitute he's

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.650 
xenon spark because with substitute he's
going<00:06:37.830> to<00:06:37.889> be<00:06:38.010> able<00:06:38.130> to<00:06:38.279> set<00:06:38.849> up<00:06:38.880> three<00:06:39.210> subsets

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
going to be able to set up three subsets

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.410 
going to be able to set up three subsets
and<00:06:39.990> that's<00:06:40.140> gonna<00:06:40.290> give<00:06:40.530> him<00:06:40.740> like<00:06:41.160> a<00:06:41.190> 20<00:06:41.640> 23

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
and that's gonna give him like a 20 23

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.150 
and that's gonna give him like a 20 23
percent<00:06:42.870> chance<00:06:43.110> of<00:06:43.230> winning<00:06:43.530> because<00:06:43.710> I<00:06:43.890> have
