00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
lay down on the Cates afterwards um just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
lay down on the Cates afterwards um just
do<00:00:55.500> half<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> time<00:00:56.120> maybe<00:00:57.120> stop<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.809> know

do half at a time maybe stop you know
just<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.270> borderline<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.469> doesn't

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
just on a borderline just so it doesn't

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.980 
just on a borderline just so it doesn't
look<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.070> odd<00:01:02.309> later<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:04.700> I

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
look a little odd later on and I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.539 
look a little odd later on and I
generally<00:01:06.990> start<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> front<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
generally start off on the front and I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
generally start off on the front and I
usually<00:01:08.909> hold<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.900> snaps<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
usually hold the little snaps and just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
usually hold the little snaps and just
do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> snaps<00:01:11.369> after<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:12.570> dries<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> first

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
do the snaps after it dries on the first

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
do the snaps after it dries on the first
coat<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.150> recommend<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.840> least<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.259> coat<00:01:16.500> um

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
coat so I recommend at least one coat um

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.149 
coat so I recommend at least one coat um
just<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> keep<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.150> color<00:01:18.360> bright<00:01:18.950> since<00:01:19.950> it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just to keep the color bright since it's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.210 
just to keep the color bright since it's
used<00:01:20.430> every<00:01:20.939> day<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
used every day so I start out and I

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.149 
used every day so I start out and I
generally<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:29.509> put<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.530> one

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
generally just put just one go in one

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.230 
generally just put just one go in one
direction<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.420> make<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:38.030> work<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
direction and then I make sure I work it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
direction and then I make sure I work it
in<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.350> than<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.649> direction<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in so I do more than one direction just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.149 
in so I do more than one direction just
to<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.579> sure<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.090> gets<00:01:45.860> an<00:01:47.270> even<00:01:48.270> coating<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
to make sure it gets an even coating and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
to make sure it gets an even coating and
then<00:01:50.159> after<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.600> good<00:01:51.840> layer<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.740> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
then after I get a good layer on I just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
then after I get a good layer on I just
make<00:01:53.610> sure<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.909> moved<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.869> can

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
make sure it's moved out so this can

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
make sure it's moved out so this can
work<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:59.780> entire<00:02:00.780> case<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:03.210> again

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
work for entire case and then again

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.530 
work for entire case and then again
don't<00:02:03.960> make<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> too<00:02:04.380> heavy<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.740> else<00:02:05.540> you're

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
don't make it too heavy or else you're

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
don't make it too heavy or else you're
going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.799> sure<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
going to have to make sure that it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
going to have to make sure that it
doesn't<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:09.000> cooped<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> center<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
doesn't get cooped up in the center of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.850 
doesn't get cooped up in the center of
any<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> cutouts

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.650 

and<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:19.230> can<00:02:19.380> work<00:02:19.620> fairly<00:02:20.130> fast<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:21.599> you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and you can work fairly fast and if you

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.540 
and you can work fairly fast and if you
don't<00:02:21.810> want<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.989> work<00:02:22.080> fast<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.890> water<00:02:23.220> down

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
don't want to work fast just water down

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
don't want to work fast just water down
your<00:02:23.580> varnish<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.209> little<00:02:24.540> bit<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:28.110> just

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
your varnish a little bit so I'm just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
your varnish a little bit so I'm just
about<00:02:28.830> done<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.489> part<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.420> would

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
about done with that part and I would

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.280 
about done with that part and I would
probably<00:02:30.870> stop<00:02:31.470> here<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.630> make<00:02:33.840> sure<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
probably stop here and make sure it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.710 
probably stop here and make sure it
worked<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:36.090> lightly<00:02:36.300> on<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
worked in just very lightly on the

worked in just very lightly on the
bottom<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.160> somewhere<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.489> put

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bottom if I don't have somewhere to put

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.530 
bottom if I don't have somewhere to put
it<00:02:38.700> down<00:02:40.099> why<00:02:41.099> i<00:02:41.130> buy<00:02:41.730> somewhere<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.300> put<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540
