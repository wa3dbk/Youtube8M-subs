00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
kitchen sink doing this we don't want to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210 
kitchen sink doing this we don't want to
break<00:00:27.150> off<00:00:27.420> any<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> tiles<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.590> surround

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
break off any of the tiles that surround

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.080 
break off any of the tiles that surround
our<00:00:29.460> corner<00:00:30.000> pieces<00:00:30.240> right<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:32.090> there's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
our corner pieces right here so there's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
our corner pieces right here so there's
one<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> doing<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.170> taking<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
one way of doing it which is taking a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.240 
one way of doing it which is taking a
cold<00:00:35.070> chisel<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.850> cold<00:00:36.090> chisel<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
cold chisel and a cold chisel is a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
cold chisel and a cold chisel is a
stainless<00:00:38.250> steel<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> hardened<00:00:39.239> steel

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
stainless steel or a hardened steel

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.920 
stainless steel or a hardened steel
chisel<00:00:40.219> unlike<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> wood<00:00:42.030> chisel<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.780> not

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
chisel unlike a wood chisel and it's not

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.229 
chisel unlike a wood chisel and it's not
very<00:00:43.140> sharp<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.250> idea<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
very sharp and the whole idea is is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080 
very sharp and the whole idea is is
breaking<00:00:45.960> off<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> areas<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.610> around

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
breaking off the areas that are around

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420 
breaking off the areas that are around
the<00:00:48.390> sink<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the sink as you can see right here that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090 
the sink as you can see right here that
the<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.180> portion<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.530> quarter

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the this portion of the the quarter

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.540 
the this portion of the the quarter
round<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:54.030> slightly<00:00:54.480> covering<00:00:55.340> just<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
round is just slightly covering just the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.130 
round is just slightly covering just the
edge<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> sink<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> lot

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
edge of the sink so we don't have a lot

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840 
edge of the sink so we don't have a lot
to<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> remove<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to take off but we do need to remove the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.870 
to take off but we do need to remove the
whole<00:01:00.030> quarter<00:01:00.750> round<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:04.640> we're<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.670> going

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
whole quarter round so we're just going

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
whole quarter round so we're just going
to<00:01:05.970> basically<00:01:06.180> flush<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.930> off<00:01:14.720> get<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to basically flush them off get in the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.140 
to basically flush them off get in the
corners<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:19.549> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
corners and we're going to take this

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
corners and we're going to take this
process<00:01:21.689> we're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.680> way

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
process we're going to do it all the way

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.780 
process we're going to do it all the way
around<00:01:22.920> until<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.060> all<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:25.790> all

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
around until you get them all off all

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
around until you get them all off all
the<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.200> see

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the way around so you can actually see

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.580 
the way around so you can actually see
the<00:01:29.340> edge<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> sink<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:31.200> buried

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the edge of the sink that was buried

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
the edge of the sink that was buried
underneath<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> quarter<00:01:32.430> round<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> then

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
underneath the quarter round and then

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
underneath the quarter round and then
you're<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.259> any<00:01:34.439> type<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you're going to take any type of a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
you're going to take any type of a
scraper<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.670> try<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> scrape<00:01:36.390> off<00:01:36.630> all

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
scraper and just try to scrape off all

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.789 
scraper and just try to scrape off all
the<00:01:37.350> excess<00:01:38.150> right<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.329> concrete<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.259> thinset

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the excess right up concrete or thinset

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.100 
the excess right up concrete or thinset
I<00:01:40.860> should<00:01:41.159> say<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:43.250> around<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> sink

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I should say that was around the sink

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.340 
I should say that was around the sink
like<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:47.759> said<00:01:48.030> until<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.509> could<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
like I said until you could see all the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
like I said until you could see all the
exposed<00:01:49.799> edges<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.149> once<00:01:51.990> that's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
exposed edges right here and once that's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
exposed edges right here and once that's
all<00:01:52.409> done<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> removed<00:01:54.420> your<00:01:54.509> plumbing

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
all done and you removed your plumbing

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.920 
all done and you removed your plumbing
is<00:01:55.920> pretty<00:01:56.280> much<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.670> grabbing<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.450> sink<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is pretty much as grabbing the sink and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.870 
is pretty much as grabbing the sink and
if<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.439> bigger<00:01:58.649> sink<00:01:58.979> get<00:01:59.520> someone<00:01:59.850> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
if it's a bigger sink get someone to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.929 
if it's a bigger sink get someone to
help<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.570> these<00:02:00.689> things<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:01.140> heavy

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
help you because these things are heavy

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
help you because these things are heavy
and<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.110> pop<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.710> till<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.009> comes

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and just pop that thing up till it comes

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.800
