00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.009
 hahaha 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.210
 at their last network meeting the 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.310
 responsible for contracts and rff contracts 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.380
 participated in a site visit 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.480
 about thirty people went so 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.859
 found in Bellegarde station for 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.710
 attend night work 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.870
 it is a modernization operation 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.890
 of the railway line between Bellegarde 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.670
 and the plain which is the first station 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.220
 at the Swiss border 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.680
 we will modernize the signage 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.649
 so put an automatic block 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.409
 bright more efficient we will also 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.949
 remote control and switch station 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:58.020
 number 1 of bellegarde and also the 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.150
 the most atypical operation and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.950
 and innovative we will say we will convert 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is a line that is already electrified 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.790
 in 15 100 volts and we will switch the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.310
 electrical voltage in twenty-five thousand 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 volts 22 km of lines are concerned 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.910
 by this work 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.650
 their goal is multiple to more or 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.200
 less long term we will make a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 much more line section 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 powerful we will be able to put so 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 pass trains so every five 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.460
 every five minutes instead of 12 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 currently 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.830
 and in terms of voltage is 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 a guy in consumer maintenance 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.400
 also since we consume less electricity 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.140
 mans in twenty-five thousand votes 115 100 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.410
 volt is also it's for a question 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.540
 a uniformity of the network realized under 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 mastery of delegated craft sncf 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 catenary song began at the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.690
 end of summer 2013 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 the change of voltage requires 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.070
 particular work the operations that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.920
 venues will be roughly a year before 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.560
 this date of rocking age beyond this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 new tension is after equip 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 gradually the existing catenary 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.850
 to make it compatible with a 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.679
 food on 25000 good a few 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.479
 simple examples you have to isolate 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.100
 correctly the catenary compared 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.899
 this tension 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.200
 it takes art you have to put 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.750
 amenities 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.599
 specificity that approximates the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.030
 traditional catenary 25000 what we 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.610
 call us the 1985 catenary 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.500
 this conversion of the catenary voltage 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.030
 is a rare operation it's 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.489
 actually rare case it's a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.319
 first national 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.940
 there have been some tests previously on 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.870
 small sections but this 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.360
 magnitude did not have 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.730
 and especially what is the characteristic 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.390
 catenary serious but that's a 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.910
 true first 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.799
 because we stay in a network operated this 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.959
 cross-border project between France 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.680
 and Switzerland is mainly funded 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.110
 by rff 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.720
 the total funding these 69 million 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.970
 euros for this part then side 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 French since there I speak on the side 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.569
 French although it's a project 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.069
 border of which concerned the 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.340
 two sides France and Switzerland 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.829
 of the 69 million euros plus 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 three quarters is financed by rff 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.700
 on own funds and in the 69 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.660
 million euros of which you have 25 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.640
 million euros for the part 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.340
 25 million for the part 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.769
 catenaries so that's pretty much a 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.170
 very big very big yard in his 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.730
 importance from July 15th 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.069
 next complete closure of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.660
 traffic will occur between would follow 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.880
 and the plain 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.150
 the line will be put back into service on the 24th 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.150
 August
