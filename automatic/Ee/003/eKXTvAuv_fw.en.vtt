and you can buy it by the foot and it's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.009 
and you can buy it by the foot and it's
just<00:03:23.329> actually<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> piece<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.320> rubber<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:26.570> I

just actually a piece of rubber and I

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.199 
just actually a piece of rubber and I
think<00:03:27.230> they<00:03:27.320> use<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.590> for<00:03:27.620> pools<00:03:28.010> or<00:03:28.430> for<00:03:28.970> decks

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
think they use it for pools or for decks

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.550 
think they use it for pools or for decks
from<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> stairs<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.769> like<00:03:32.440> gives<00:03:33.440> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
from the stairs so it's like gives you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.620 
from the stairs so it's like gives you
some<00:03:33.709> traction<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:35.269> says<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:36.560> know

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
some traction and it says it's you know

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.479 
some traction and it says it's you know
comfortable<00:03:38.630> for<00:03:38.900> bare<00:03:39.049> feet<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.489> hopefully

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
comfortable for bare feet so hopefully

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.509 
comfortable for bare feet so hopefully
it'll<00:03:40.609> work<00:03:40.790> out<00:03:40.910> k<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.480> little<00:03:41.900> gusts<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.890> I

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
it'll work out k for little gusts and I

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.160 
it'll work out k for little gusts and I
just<00:03:43.730> kept<00:03:43.880> an<00:03:43.970> extra<00:03:44.209> sheet<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.600> in<00:03:44.750> case<00:03:44.930> we

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
just kept an extra sheet just in case we

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.949 
just kept an extra sheet just in case we
ever<00:03:45.290> add<00:03:45.560> another<00:03:45.859> ramp<00:03:46.220> or<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.750> change

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
ever add another ramp or have to change

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.110 
ever add another ramp or have to change
this<00:03:48.079> one<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.620> hopefully<00:03:49.489> he<00:03:49.579> won't<00:03:49.700> chew<00:03:49.970> on

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
this one and hopefully he won't chew on

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.340 
this one and hopefully he won't chew on
it<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:51.079> sticks<00:03:51.380> down<00:03:51.560> pretty<00:03:51.799> good<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:54.290> if

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
it it sticks down pretty good so but if

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.780 
it it sticks down pretty good so but if
he<00:03:54.410> does<00:03:54.560> we'll<00:03:54.739> have<00:03:54.829> to<00:03:54.950> take<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.459> out<00:03:55.579> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
he does we'll have to take it out and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.099 
he does we'll have to take it out and
think<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.480> something<00:03:56.630> else

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
think of something else

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.979 
think of something else

he<00:04:11.239> actually<00:04:11.510> used<00:04:11.660> Bulldog<00:04:12.530> clips<00:04:12.829> for<00:04:13.519> these

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
he actually used Bulldog clips for these

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.129

but<00:04:15.319> I<00:04:15.709> just

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
but I just

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.219 
but I just
use<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.439> ties<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.909> seems<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.209> work<00:04:18.239> just

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
use the ties and it seems to work just

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.759 
use the ties and it seems to work just
as<00:04:19.409> well

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
as well

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.860 
as well
and<00:04:20.099> every<00:04:20.639> time<00:04:20.759> whoops<00:04:21.329> every<00:04:21.539> time<00:04:21.659> I<00:04:21.749> go

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
and every time whoops every time I go

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.689 
and every time whoops every time I go
out<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.139> keep<00:04:22.349> forgetting<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.740> buy<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.310> Bulldog

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
out I keep forgetting to buy the Bulldog

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.820 
out I keep forgetting to buy the Bulldog
clips<00:04:23.939> anyway<00:04:25.699> but<00:04:26.699> what<00:04:26.849> it<00:04:26.939> does<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.830> this

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
clips anyway but what it does is this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.989 
clips anyway but what it does is this
part<00:04:29.099> of<00:04:29.159> the<00:04:29.219> cage<00:04:29.400> actually<00:04:29.789> put<00:04:29.909> together

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:29.999

with<00:04:30.270> zip<00:04:30.449> ties<00:04:30.860> as<00:04:31.860> opposed<00:04:32.219> to<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.550> little

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.769 
with zip ties as opposed to the little
clips<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.669> untie<00:04:35.999> it<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.270> then<00:04:36.689> it

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:36.779 
clips so you just untie it and then it

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.649 
clips so you just untie it and then it
can<00:04:36.900> fold<00:04:37.229> down<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.770> lay<00:04:38.639> flats<00:04:38.999> and<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.449> kids
