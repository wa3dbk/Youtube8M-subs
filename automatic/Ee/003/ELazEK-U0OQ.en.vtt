00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
I'm sure the real truck has a two bottom

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.890 
I'm sure the real truck has a two bottom
it<00:02:53.850> would<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.060> been<00:02:54.150> nice<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> model

it would have been nice on the model

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.000 
it would have been nice on the model
that<00:02:54.990> they<00:02:55.110> would<00:02:55.200> have<00:02:55.290> filled<00:02:55.530> these<00:02:55.740> in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that they would have filled these in

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.280 
that they would have filled these in
here<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.600> really<00:02:57.870> nothing<00:02:58.140> could

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
here but you know really nothing could

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.910 
here but you know really nothing could
do<00:02:59.150> the<00:03:00.150> back<00:03:00.300> fenders<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:01.080> chrome<00:03:01.680> and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
they're also metal I think that gives it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.850 
they're also metal I think that gives it
a<00:03:03.540> very<00:03:03.570> nice<00:03:03.930> look<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> breaks<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.740> the

you<00:03:59.640> could<00:03:59.790> screw<00:04:00.120> them<00:04:00.269> down<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.959> could

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
you could screw them down but you could

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.259 
you could screw them down but you could
see<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.410> threads<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.850> back<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.209> the

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
see the threads and the back of the

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.160 
see the threads and the back of the
trailer<00:04:08.090> has<00:04:09.090> mud<00:04:09.390> flaps<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.019> could

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
trailer has mud flaps and you could

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.390 
trailer has mud flaps and you could
still<00:04:10.350> even<00:04:10.590> make<00:04:10.680> out<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.830> orange<00:04:11.100> frame

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
still even make out the orange frame

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.729 
still even make out the orange frame
which<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.610> cool<00:04:12.170> other<00:04:13.170> side<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.530> trailer

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
which is cool other side of the trailer

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.699 
which is cool other side of the trailer
is<00:04:13.860> pretty<00:04:14.220> much<00:04:14.310> exactly<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.880> same<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.470> it

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
is pretty much exactly the same and it

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.979 
is pretty much exactly the same and it
does<00:04:16.890> have<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.459> tarp<00:04:17.880> which<00:04:18.120> opens<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.900> if

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
does have the tarp which opens and if

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.870 
does have the tarp which opens and if
you<00:04:19.080> don't<00:04:19.260> know<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.650> tarp<00:04:19.919> locks<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.489> right

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you don't know the tarp locks in right

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.940 
you don't know the tarp locks in right
here<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.870> basically<00:04:22.320> just<00:04:22.410> pull<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:22.800> out

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
here so you basically just pull that out

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.440 
here so you basically just pull that out
like<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.910> really<00:04:24.060> doesn't<00:04:24.419> affect

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
like that and it really doesn't affect

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.900 
like that and it really doesn't affect
because<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.260> tarp<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.680> then<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.370> flap<00:04:26.640> it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
because it's a tarp and then you flap it

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.640 
because it's a tarp and then you flap it
/<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.330> you're<00:04:27.690> supposed<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> put<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.320> metal

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
/ and you're supposed to put the metal

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.280 
/ and you're supposed to put the metal
in<00:04:28.830> those<00:04:29.340> little<00:04:29.520> hooks<00:04:30.320> right<00:04:31.320> here<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:32.040> so

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
in those little hooks right here like so

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.610 
in those little hooks right here like so
and<00:04:34.290> then<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.890> has<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.160> frames<00:04:35.460> from<00:04:35.700> tarp<00:04:36.620> but

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
and then it has the frames from tarp but

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.420 
and then it has the frames from tarp but
anyway<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.810> side<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.740> trailer<00:04:41.040> or<00:04:41.370> the

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
anyway the side of the trailer or the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.140 
anyway the side of the trailer or the
back<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.030> should<00:04:42.240> say<00:04:42.860> does<00:04:43.860> open<00:04:44.310> up<00:04:44.580> like

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
back that I should say does open up like

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.880 
back that I should say does open up like
I'm<00:04:45.300> saying<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.660> back<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.110> does<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
I'm saying in the back of it does a

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.210 
I'm saying in the back of it does a
swing<00:04:47.670> open<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:48.720> doesn't<00:04:49.080> hinge<00:04:49.890> from<00:04:50.130> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
swing open that doesn't hinge from the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.880 
swing open that doesn't hinge from the
top<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.900> another<00:04:51.900> cool<00:04:52.110> thing<00:04:52.170> is<00:04:52.500> if<00:04:52.710> you

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
top and another cool thing is if you

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.130 
top and another cool thing is if you
move<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:54.180> will<00:04:54.330> open<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:54.990> could

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
move this it will open that so you could

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.310 
move this it will open that so you could
dump<00:04:55.290> clean<00:04:55.560> off<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:57.180> see<00:04:57.360> like<00:04:57.540> on<00:04:57.690> some<00:04:57.930> road

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
dump clean off you see like on some road

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.230 
dump clean off you see like on some road
jobs<00:04:59.210> and<00:05:00.230> I'll<00:05:01.230> show<00:05:01.410> you<00:05:01.440> how<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.860> dumps<00:05:02.190> now

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.320 

and<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:07.170> dumps<00:05:07.350> in<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.800> very<00:05:08.310> cool<00:05:08.610> way<00:05:08.670> mostly

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
and it dumps in a very cool way mostly

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.370 
and it dumps in a very cool way mostly
people<00:05:09.750> will<00:05:10.050> be<00:05:10.170> familiar<00:05:10.380> with<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:12.380> if

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
people will be familiar with this so if

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.750 
people will be familiar with this so if
you<00:05:13.590> hold<00:05:13.770> down<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.920> 5th<00:05:14.190> wheel<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.670> just

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you hold down the 5th wheel and just

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.130 
you hold down the 5th wheel and just
bring<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.090> up

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
bring that up

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.020 
bring that up
it's<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.530> multi-stage<00:05:17.100> cylinder<00:05:17.670> and<00:05:17.850> then<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
it's a multi-stage cylinder and then the

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.960 
it's a multi-stage cylinder and then the
frame<00:05:18.300> right<00:05:18.720> here<00:05:18.750> is<00:05:19.680> all<00:05:19.920> orange<00:05:20.400> which

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
frame right here is all orange which

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.280 
frame right here is all orange which
looks<00:05:21.690> super<00:05:22.620> nice<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:24.000> conclusion<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.840> I

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
looks super nice so in conclusion I I

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.570 
looks super nice so in conclusion I I
really<00:05:25.680> don't<00:05:25.860> know<00:05:25.950> if<00:05:25.980> these<00:05:26.160> are<00:05:26.220> still

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
really don't know if these are still

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.660 
really don't know if these are still
available<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.210> be<00:05:27.240> completely<00:05:27.780> honest<00:05:28.640> like<00:05:29.640> I

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
available to be completely honest like I

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.060 
available to be completely honest like I
said<00:05:30.000> I'm<00:05:30.180> sure<00:05:30.210> how<00:05:30.570> many<00:05:30.630> were<00:05:31.470> made<00:05:31.710> but<00:05:31.920> I'm

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
said I'm sure how many were made but I'm

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.670 
said I'm sure how many were made but I'm
assuming<00:05:32.610> less<00:05:32.940> than<00:05:33.150> 100<00:05:33.630> it's<00:05:34.320> very<00:05:34.500> hard

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
assuming less than 100 it's very hard

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.760 
assuming less than 100 it's very hard
