that

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.130 

I<00:00:22.310> told<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:23.120> before<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.540> reason<00:00:23.690> that<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:23.960> was

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
I told you before the reason that I was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.920 
I told you before the reason that I was
interested<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:24.680> genes<00:00:25.010> in<00:00:25.250> DNA<00:00:25.900> because<00:00:26.900> I

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
interested in genes in DNA because I

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.630 
interested in genes in DNA because I
wanted<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:27.320> know<00:00:27.500> who<00:00:27.680> I<00:00:27.710> was

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
wanted to know who I was

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.360 
wanted to know who I was
where<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:29.660> came<00:00:30.200> from<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:33.040> thought<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.190> if<00:00:34.280> I

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
where I came from I thought that if I

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.940 
where I came from I thought that if I
analyzed<00:00:34.880> my<00:00:35.180> DNA<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.750> could<00:00:36.200> find<00:00:36.500> out<00:00:36.710> who<00:00:36.920> I

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
analyzed my DNA I could find out who I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.270 
analyzed my DNA I could find out who I
was<00:00:37.340> who<00:00:38.150> my<00:00:38.300> parents<00:00:38.600> were<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.500> I<00:00:40.070> thought

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
was who my parents were and I thought

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.670 
was who my parents were and I thought
that<00:00:40.460> if<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:40.699> knew<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.120> then<00:00:41.720> I'd<00:00:41.870> know<00:00:42.470> what

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
that if I knew that then I'd know what

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.470 
that if I knew that then I'd know what
path<00:00:43.010> I<00:00:43.309> should<00:00:43.340> take<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:43.820> life<00:00:46.239> but<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.330> was

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
path I should take in life but I was

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.220
