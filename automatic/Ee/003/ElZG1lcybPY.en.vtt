00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.730 
look at it as more competitive and
things<00:03:14.690> like<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.110> comparing<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.709> to

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
things like that but comparing it to

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.890 
things like that but comparing it to
check<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.519> street<00:03:17.269> fighters<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.720> things

check in and street fighters and things
like<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.290> felt<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.620> was<00:03:18.709> more<00:03:18.860> casual<00:03:19.400> it

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
like that I felt it was more casual it

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.890 
like that I felt it was more casual it
was<00:03:19.610> kind<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.880> easy<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.239> do<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.450> combos<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
was kind of easy to do the combos and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.360 
was kind of easy to do the combos and
things<00:03:21.230> like<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.440> once<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.890> get<00:03:22.040> them<00:03:22.130> down

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
things like that once you get them down

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.070 
things like that once you get them down
and<00:03:22.670> only<00:03:22.970> took<00:03:23.180> me<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.360> few<00:03:23.540> minutes<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.870> start

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
and only took me a few minutes to start

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.860 
and only took me a few minutes to start
doing<00:03:24.410> up<00:03:24.880> godlike<00:03:25.880> combos<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.420> things<00:03:26.690> like
