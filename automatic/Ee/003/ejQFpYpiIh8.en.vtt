00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
second game we didn't lean swap and we

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
second game we didn't lean swap and we
went<00:01:17.220> two<00:01:17.369> versus<00:01:17.729> two<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.570> did<00:01:18.720> pretty

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
went two versus two and we did pretty

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.260 
went two versus two and we did pretty
well<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.439> third<00:01:20.220> game<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.640> tried<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
well so third game we tried to do the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
well so third game we tried to do the
same<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.560> kind<00:01:22.740> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
agenda samita we didn't do too well so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
agenda samita we didn't do too well so
we<00:02:08.729> disqualified<00:02:09.090> kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.840> early<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.069> had

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
we disqualified kind of early so we had

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.720 
we disqualified kind of early so we had
ample<00:02:11.610> time<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.849> prepare<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
ample time to prepare and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.630 
ample time to prepare and
so<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.870> believe<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:14.560> are<00:02:14.590> at<00:02:15.099> an<00:02:15.280> advantage

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so I believe we are at an advantage

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.940 
so I believe we are at an advantage
since<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:16.239> had<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.540> much<00:02:16.690> time<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.959> prepare<00:02:17.230> for
