00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.210 
structure but then it is coated with
this<00:03:22.060> piece<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.540> wood<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.530> stretched<00:03:23.920> and

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
this piece of wood that is stretched and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.180 
this piece of wood that is stretched and
put<00:03:24.519> around<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.180> case<00:03:25.480> itself<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.799> make<00:03:27.040> it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
put around the case itself to make it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.350 
put around the case itself to make it
have<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.750> knock<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.930> wood<00:03:28.989> type<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.160> case<00:03:30.640> now

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
have this knock on wood type of case now

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720 
have this knock on wood type of case now
every<00:03:32.110> case<00:03:32.350> every<00:03:32.560> wood<00:03:32.860> case<00:03:33.070> if<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.340> have<00:03:33.519> is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
every case every wood case if I have is

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.789 
every case every wood case if I have is
going<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> be<00:03:34.090> different<00:03:34.530> obviously<00:03:35.530> because

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
going to be different obviously because

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.229 
going to be different obviously because
all<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.160> wood<00:03:36.340> none<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.790> it's<00:03:37.000> going<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.180> be

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
all the wood none of it's going to be

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.120 
all the wood none of it's going to be
the<00:03:37.329> same<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.780> every<00:03:38.170> case<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.950> going

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
the same so every case you have is going

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.319 
the same so every case you have is going
to<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.250> original<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.150> gonna<00:03:40.239> be

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
to be original and it's not gonna be

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.840 
to be original and it's not gonna be
like<00:03:40.359> any<00:03:40.600> other<00:03:40.889> ones<00:03:41.889> in<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.549> line<00:03:42.820> that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
like any other ones in that line that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.210 
like any other ones in that line that
they<00:03:43.209> may<00:03:43.389> have<00:03:43.570> on<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.680> inside

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
they may have on the inside

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.130 
they may have on the inside
case<00:03:45.460> it's<00:03:45.850> nice<00:03:46.270> and<00:03:46.300> smooth<00:03:46.720> except<00:03:47.020> for

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
case it's nice and smooth except for

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.510 
case it's nice and smooth except for
these<00:03:47.230> two<00:03:47.290> lines<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.890> go<00:03:47.980> down<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.220> center

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
these two lines that go down the center

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.070 
these two lines that go down the center
I<00:03:48.700> believe<00:03:49.270> that's<00:03:49.420> maybe<00:03:49.690> where<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:49.990> was

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
I believe that's maybe where it was

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.570 
I believe that's maybe where it was
sealed<00:03:50.380> or<00:03:50.650> marry<00:03:50.830> maybe<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.250> always<00:03:51.430> put

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
sealed or marry maybe we always put

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.580 
sealed or marry maybe we always put
together<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.810> doesn't<00:03:53.050> seem<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.230> too

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
together but it doesn't seem like too

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.020 
together but it doesn't seem like too
big<00:03:53.770> of<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.950> deal<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.310> doesn't<00:03:54.580> seem<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.760> it's

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
big of a deal it doesn't seem like it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.990 
big of a deal it doesn't seem like it's
sharp<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:55.930> smooth<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:57.550> if<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.760> does

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
sharp it is so smooth but if that does

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.640 
sharp it is so smooth but if that does
bother<00:03:58.210> you<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.630> this<00:03:58.870> may<00:03:59.080> not<00:03:59.230> be<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.410> case

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
bother you that this may not be the case

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.990 
bother you that this may not be the case

it's so thin you can't do that many
minor<00:05:48.790> adjustments<00:05:49.240> or<00:05:49.360> might<00:05:49.540> snap<00:05:49.840> or

something but the top is a little off
you<00:05:52.540> guys<00:05:52.690> can<00:05:52.840> see<00:05:52.990> how<00:05:53.050> it<00:05:53.110> goes<00:05:53.349> over<00:05:53.590> that

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
you guys can see how it goes over that

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.409 
you guys can see how it goes over that
comes<00:05:53.979> up<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.460> little<00:05:54.669> bit<00:05:54.789> so<00:05:55.210> it's<00:05:55.330> not

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
comes up a little bit so it's not

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.510 
comes up a little bit so it's not
directly<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.169> back<00:05:56.349> of<00:05:56.560> your<00:05:56.890> iPod<00:05:57.280> so<00:05:57.460> it

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
directly on the back of your iPod so it

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.510 
directly on the back of your iPod so it
might<00:05:57.640> be<00:05:57.669> a<00:05:57.789> little<00:05:57.910> bit<00:05:58.060> loose

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
might be a little bit loose

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.059 
might be a little bit loose
if<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.789> were<00:06:00.879> to<00:06:01.000> drop<00:06:01.210> it<00:06:01.389> or<00:06:01.509> something<00:06:02.069> so

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
if you were to drop it or something so

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.580 
if you were to drop it or something so
that<00:06:03.550> doesn't<00:06:03.879> perfectly<00:06:04.389> match<00:06:04.539> up<00:06:04.810> and<00:06:05.080> the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
that doesn't perfectly match up and the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.929 
that doesn't perfectly match up and the
same<00:06:05.770> thing<00:06:05.949> on<00:06:06.039> the<00:06:06.099> bottom<00:06:06.219> it's<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.639> little

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
same thing on the bottom it's a little

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.020 
same thing on the bottom it's a little
bit<00:06:07.030> off<00:06:07.180> but<00:06:07.960> that<00:06:08.860> comes<00:06:09.189> with<00:06:09.460> it<00:06:09.490> being<00:06:09.849> a

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
bit off but that comes with it being a

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.300 
bit off but that comes with it being a
really<00:06:10.360> thin<00:06:10.629> material<00:06:11.199> and<00:06:11.409> that<00:06:11.949> it's<00:06:12.099> not

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
really thin material and that it's not

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.550 
really thin material and that it's not
really<00:06:12.729> going<00:06:12.969> to<00:06:13.150> that<00:06:13.750> they<00:06:13.930> can<00:06:14.169> do<00:06:14.319> much

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
really going to that they can do much

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.469 
really going to that they can do much
about<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:14.889> because<00:06:15.069> it<00:06:15.340> might<00:06:15.460> snap<00:06:15.789> there<00:06:16.449> a

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
about it because it might snap there a

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.240 
about it because it might snap there a
lot<00:06:16.569> of<00:06:16.599> jagged<00:06:17.050> edges<00:06:17.199> around<00:06:17.560> here<00:06:17.919> that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
lot of jagged edges around here that

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.129 
lot of jagged edges around here that
they're<00:06:18.550> not<00:06:18.699> really<00:06:19.120> sharp<00:06:19.539> they're<00:06:19.840> just

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139
