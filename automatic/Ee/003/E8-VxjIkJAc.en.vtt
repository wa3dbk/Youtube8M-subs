00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.100
 Too bad most urgently contaminated children play 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.889
 roles 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:09.769
 already 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.530
 so when you play alone they can be the driver of the car with 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.929
 which he plays another 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.460
 m a gendarme who makes the traffic and then as soon as he plays in a group and well 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.599
 he plays indeed them the Indians or the cowboys you want to bangui the thieves 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.560
 the police men 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.160
 so that children are familiar 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.600
 to take on roles in their game 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.310
 so reviewed why talk about playing too much kindergarten since kids do 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.380
 this in the playground 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.920
 for one main reason it is that unfortunately very often in the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 playground in the courtyard of building 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.380
 when children want to play they are prevented from doing so by one or the other 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.120
 of them who just do not know how to play there are always children who 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 not well internalized the rules in the game 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.519
 and who can not help but hit the hosts for real 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.230
 to throw them on the ground 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.290
 children who do not know that in a game we pretend 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.800
 what is the purpose of the funny kindergarten game 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.230
 it is to teach the children to pretend 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.510
 p but i believe that more children 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.940
 they will be to incite to imitate for faux pas pretend 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.290
 and me they will be tempted to imitate for should particular violent images 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.880
 he sees on television 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.370
 so I saw her I think we 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.110
 we remember a good reason already in the frame the game of children from the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.539
 is to encourage children to respect the rules 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.259
 to learn that those who do not know how to play add to them learn how to do 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.250
 show 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 but we realize that as soon as we take into account the role plays at the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.160
 mother 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.310
 the consequences are far beyond that the first consequence 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.650
 to see that I'm taking kindergarten is a great instrument 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.970
 to introduce a child to socialization 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.979
 and then to the socialization speaking because 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.970
 the children lift their finger in turn they listen to what everyone says 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.509
 in turn intervene 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.700
 and then speaking because every child 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.810
 were invited to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.210
 to say what he will do before playing but see all with the expression moan 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 and socialization these two major imperatives of kindergarten 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.540
 cobbb 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.839
 that's another country that's filled with 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.409
 m important specifications of socialization oral expression and in 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.060
 more 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.680
 which allows children to play 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.840
 and we realize that the funny game in addition to other subtleties 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320
 as soon as we play the children 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.880
 from the images they are experiencing are upset because it takes 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.040
 know that kids he's not content to watch programs for 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.450
 children full of the age of 3 years and a half and four years 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.649
 children watch the news 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.980
 the vampire of the clan more about television series 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.250
 there were three and a half growth often even before 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.020
 and so when children are asked to role-play from 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.649
 images that they saw we realize that 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:57.319
 talk about images and really for them very important because these images 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.479
 have mobilized so much emotion in unlimited mandates in case 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.500
 worry or sometimes two 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.290
 the same of disgust 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 we realize that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.559
 talking about images allows them to take a step back 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.439
 to choose a little bit what is called image education take a step back 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.759
 and take distance in relation also mages so the role play allows 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.829
 that too 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.650
 learning socialization oral expression decline compared to 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.450
 pictures and then we realize that the role play and a third leave in 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.509
 avoiding children's days 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.769
 to play 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.280
 alternatively for example the aggressors and the victims 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.059
 by obliging them I change funny that one does not oblige years 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.329
 the attackers played the victims that the victims to play the attackers 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.240
 we realize that we are with children 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.389
 to be able to better 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.760
 to develop them suffers between them you know how to suffer 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.069
 this ability we have to put ourselves in the shoes of others 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 who makes a child 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.949
 can be violent than hurt other oz 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.290
 often it's because he does not realize he's hurting the other 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.370
 developing the empathic capacity of children is to make sure that 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.049
 attackers 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.370
 happy it better represents the harm they do to the victims and then it's 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.590
 also allow that 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.829
 in the best case 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.820
 the victim can not think of himself as a possible aggressor 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.280
 and see the role play also an important role big role to explore 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.630
 maybe the game too far 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.489
 should help to ensure that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.380
 children do not freeze fast in roles 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.140
 that from kindergarten we do not see as today already to children 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.070
 who perceive themselves as little caÃ¯ds to vulnerable 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.740
 children who perceive themselves as designated victims 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.690
 it is very worrying because in general 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.720
 which is of little concern to educationalists or even to the political authorities is that 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.690
 some children 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.110
 always perceive themselves as an aggressor I believe that the fact that some 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.380
 children still perceive themselves as victim is just as worrying 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.559
 because after all 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.629
 there were not so many children who see themselves as a victim I would have 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:53.490
 probably 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.499
 fewer children able to exercise their aggression against others 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.580
 and so suddenly the role play see liquidity to allow the 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:03.020
 children 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.230
 to reclaim all the possible roles of a situation 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.070
 to be perceived sometimes as an aggressor sometimes as a victim 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.930
 sometimes as a rectifier of wrongs why not 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 the funny game allows 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.250
 to help them all sense stigmatized to the body 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.820
 for the big problem today 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.820
 to which we are subjected in our culture our civilization 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.759
 the danger 22 look for them looking for the events for the beginning of the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.659
 children assume it in the world run the risk of a shift to the 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:32.550
 delinquency 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.599
 of the points were dominated 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.629
 designated to engage them in programs 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.150
 of recovery port therapy 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.719
 and then stigmatize them 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.969
 while the role play can allow 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.659
 to all so all those who are in great need of whom it is of course the father 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.200
 five to six hours on the tempo sense I troll can allow all of 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.950
 to find a fluidity in fixette poiret of strain of 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.850
 disengage from debt 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.010
 ncc exclusive identification 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.300
 to the victim to the aggressor of the same wrong rotation
