will be with mjx or with Double L toys

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.750 
will be with mjx or with Double L toys
since<00:00:41.610> transmitters<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:43.140> compatible

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
since transmitters are not compatible

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
since transmitters are not compatible
you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:46.820> have<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.030> pick<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.930> them

you have to have to pick one of them
it's<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.280> too<00:00:51.000> many<00:00:51.149> transmitters

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it's not to have too many transmitters

like<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.860> all<00:02:17.069> my<00:02:17.489> crafts<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.340> Bellary<00:02:20.880> will<00:02:21.360> be

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
like on all my crafts so Bellary will be

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.160 
like on all my crafts so Bellary will be
interchangeable<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:23.690> already<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.900> these

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
interchangeable I already have these

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.229 
interchangeable I already have these
kind<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.590> batteries<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.030> I'm<00:02:27.180> very<00:02:27.360> happy<00:02:29.239> is

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
kind of batteries so I'm very happy is

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.130 
kind of batteries so I'm very happy is
that<00:02:30.450> choice

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that choice

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.650

purpose<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.530> video<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.640> find<00:02:59.910> out

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
purpose of this video now is to find out

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.780 
purpose of this video now is to find out
how<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.510> thing<00:03:00.750> works<00:03:01.250> because<00:03:02.250> otherwise<00:03:02.609> I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
how this thing works because otherwise I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.809 
how this thing works because otherwise I
don't<00:03:03.299> have<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.680> require<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.190> video

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
don't have and so they require a video

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.460 
don't have and so they require a video
to<00:03:12.209> prove<00:03:13.549> malfunctioning<00:03:15.230> that's<00:03:16.230> why<00:03:16.440> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
to prove malfunctioning that's why I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.580 
to prove malfunctioning that's why I
happen<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.510> Wow<00:03:18.769> what's<00:03:19.769> this

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
happen to Wow what's this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.800 
happen to Wow what's this
this<00:03:22.590> must<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.959> what<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:26.150> haven't<00:03:27.150> no<00:03:27.269> idea<00:03:27.630> what

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this must be what I haven't no idea what

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.250 
this must be what I haven't no idea what
is<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.620> he's<00:03:29.239> not<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.269> important<00:03:31.109> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
is this and he's not very important to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.990 
is this and he's not very important to
me<00:03:31.410> now<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.970> mode<00:03:33.299> 2<00:03:34.819> transmitter<00:03:35.819> now

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
me now so I have mode 2 transmitter now

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.030 
me now so I have mode 2 transmitter now
with<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> switch<00:03:38.299> besides<00:03:39.299> we<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.799> allow<00:03:40.799> me

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040

time three three berries look at that

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.529 
time three three berries look at that
believe<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:51.389> port<00:05:52.389> number<00:05:52.509> of<00:05:52.930> berries<00:05:53.500> I

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
believe that port number of berries I

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:01.379 
believe that port number of berries I
can't<00:05:55.539> believe<00:05:55.900> it<00:05:59.370> this<00:06:00.370> is<00:06:00.580> amazing

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
can't believe it this is amazing

I<00:06:01.860> didn't<00:06:02.860> know<00:06:03.810> they<00:06:04.810> did<00:06:05.080> this<00:06:05.259> trench<00:06:05.770> and

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
I didn't know they did this trench and

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.800 
I didn't know they did this trench and
this<00:06:06.130> is<00:06:06.310> smaller<00:06:06.639> I<00:06:07.000> noticed<00:06:07.539> that<00:06:07.630> it's

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
this is smaller I noticed that it's

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.649 
this is smaller I noticed that it's
smaller<00:06:08.110> but<00:06:08.199> I<00:06:08.409> thought<00:06:08.800> it's<00:06:09.009> just<00:06:09.310> me<00:06:09.659> but

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
smaller but I thought it's just me but

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.189 
smaller but I thought it's just me but
figure<00:06:11.560> that<00:06:11.740> fatty<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:13.270> preceding<00:06:13.840> one<00:06:13.990> was

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
figure that fatty the preceding one was

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.930 
figure that fatty the preceding one was
much<00:06:14.440> better<00:06:14.800> not<00:06:15.009> much<00:06:15.340> bigger<00:06:16.080> anyway<00:06:17.940> now

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
much better not much bigger anyway now

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.629 
much better not much bigger anyway now
we<00:06:19.000> connect<00:06:19.719> to<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.169> aircraft<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:21.099> try<00:06:21.580> to

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
we connect to the aircraft and try to

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.899 
we connect to the aircraft and try to
take<00:06:22.630> off<00:06:22.930> to<00:06:23.560> see<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:24.159> this<00:06:24.370> thing<00:06:24.639> works

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
take off to see that this thing works

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.559 
take off to see that this thing works
that's<00:06:25.180> all<00:06:25.389> I<00:06:25.419> want<00:06:25.719> to<00:06:25.840> show<00:06:26.050> you<00:06:26.110> now<00:06:27.569> to

that's all I want to show you now to
show<00:06:28.810> to<00:06:29.469> check<00:06:29.710> myself<00:06:29.979> and<00:06:30.759> these<00:06:31.000> thing

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
show to check myself and these thing

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.249

works it does I will be looking at that
myself<00:06:40.770> so

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.679 

why<00:06:47.520> is<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.730> spinning

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.650 

interesting

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.210 

something's<00:07:16.660> wrong<00:07:16.870> about<00:07:17.080> aircraft<00:07:17.530> that's

something's wrong about aircraft that's

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:27.210 
something's wrong about aircraft that's
for<00:07:18.460> sure<00:07:22.980> something<00:07:23.980> is<00:07:24.100> very<00:07:24.130> wrong<00:07:24.550> is<00:07:25.060> it
