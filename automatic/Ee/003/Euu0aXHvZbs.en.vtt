00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.040
 But it's a good day for everyone. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 Let's make an easy video now. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:14.599
 now here how to change the water filter 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.670
 pajero tr4 only needed in the filter and 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:22.289
 by the hands of the hands you will let go 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 the two pieces 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 The problem now is just to hold the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.250
 phone and shoot 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.359
 You see a small movement by the hand. 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.359
 Are you already free with him? 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:49.780
 Try to hold it here, I'll use it once. 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:58.390
 I get difficult does not have difficult game. 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:59.320
 make the film swap is simple you do not 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.770
 can zoom 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 we do not want 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.920
 I will try to move forward that not 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.920
 You will have the same way 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.700
 continuing I did not find anyone to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.539
 hold the cell phone 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:32.299
 I'll try to leave it here with 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:54.069
 this advice is the thread that this business is 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:56.979
 hot is filming a new filter 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:07.250
 internal groove 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:09.229
 again ended 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.260
 do not take a minute it takes longer to try 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.510
 hold the cell phone to shoot this one 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.609
 had to return the bar to miss more 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.819
 a component or screw here 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.690
 side was gone and it 's already 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.720
 finalized 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.980
 Beauty I hope it helps the galera that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.220
 you need to change the filter, remembering that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.810
 This is a 01 07 but talking front 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.190
 should not differ much from the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.389
 more modern models ok 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.389
 hug to everyone
