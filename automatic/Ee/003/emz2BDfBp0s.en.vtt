00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
basically what it comes down to is they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically what it comes down to is they
don't<00:00:57.420> run<00:00:57.800> about<00:00:58.910> $60<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.149> $70<00:01:00.930> online<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.210 
they've really seemed like such a good
deal<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
deal but they're not and that's the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
deal but they're not and that's the
shame<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.299> they're<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:11.600> year<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.839 
here because now this is ridiculously
expensive<00:02:25.569> in<00:02:26.049> my<00:02:26.200> book<00:02:26.439> I<00:02:26.709> bought<00:02:27.189> a<00:02:27.430> lot<00:02:27.700> of

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
expensive in my book I bought a lot of

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.599 
expensive in my book I bought a lot of
expensive<00:02:28.329> tools<00:02:28.540> I've<00:02:28.959> been<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> mechanic<00:02:29.920> of

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
expensive tools I've been a mechanic of

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.890 
expensive tools I've been a mechanic of
this<00:02:31.060> sort<00:02:31.359> or<00:02:31.510> another<00:02:31.629> for<00:02:32.400> over<00:02:33.400> ten<00:02:33.609> years

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
this sort or another for over ten years

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.759 
this sort or another for over ten years
so<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.340> not<00:02:36.700> new<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.359> me<00:02:37.389> to<00:02:37.810> spend<00:02:38.200> hundreds

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769
