capture that you know that battle for
yardage<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.310> come<00:00:29.460> down<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.880> one

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
yardage it can come down to just one

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
yardage it can come down to just one
inch<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.960> Sunday<00:00:31.320> whether<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.920> win

inch you know on Sunday whether you win
or<00:00:32.070> lose<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> things<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.110> added

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
or lose so one of the things we added

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.819 
or lose so one of the things we added
this<00:00:34.800> year<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.300> protec<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.710> stands<00:00:37.710> for

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
this year was protec and stands for

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
this year was protec and stands for
procedural<00:00:38.280> tackling<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.629> kind

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
procedural tackling and it's just kind

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
procedural tackling and it's just kind
of<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.870> new<00:00:39.989> animation<00:00:40.440> system<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.920> we've

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
of a new animation system that we've

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
of a new animation system that we've
built<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.430> allows<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.440> procedurally

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
built that allows us to procedurally

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
built that allows us to procedurally
manipulate<00:00:43.950> motion<00:00:44.489> captured<00:00:44.850> animations<00:00:45.360> as

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
manipulate motion captured animations as

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.770 
manipulate motion captured animations as
they<00:00:45.719> play<00:00:45.899> back<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:48.059> show<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.600> mean

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
they play back so i can show here i mean

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
they play back so i can show here i mean
here's<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> nice<00:00:49.469> broken<00:00:49.920> tackle

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
here's just like a nice broken tackle

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
here's just like a nice broken tackle
type<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.379> all

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
type thing that's going on and then all

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
type thing that's going on and then all
of<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.129> sudden<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.610> three<00:00:54.090> guys<00:00:54.270> tack<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.809> for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
of a sudden like three guys tack on for

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.099 
of a sudden like three guys tack on for
a<00:00:55.079> gang<00:00:55.289> tackle<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.899> built

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a gang tackle so you know we built

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.590 
a gang tackle so you know we built
protec<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> the<00:01:00.000> main<00:01:00.180> goal<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
protec really with the the main goal in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.139 
protec really with the the main goal in
mind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.770> changing<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
mind of kind of really changing up the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.910 
mind of kind of really changing up the
way<00:01:03.270> tackling<00:01:03.690> work<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.710> ended<00:01:04.830> up

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
way tackling work and we ended up

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
way tackling work and we ended up
sharing<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> lot<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> those<00:01:05.729> technologies<00:01:06.060> with

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sharing a lot of those technologies with

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
sharing a lot of those technologies with
with<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.380> blocking<00:01:07.650> system<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> i<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.240> i

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
with our blocking system so i think i

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.730 
with our blocking system so i think i
should<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.600> able<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> probably<00:01:09.990> show<00:01:10.229> here

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.980 

so<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:18.700> years<00:01:18.970> past<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.450> man<00:01:19.600> there<00:01:19.810> never

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
so in years past a man there never

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.620 
so in years past a man there never
really<00:01:20.049> was<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.439> good<00:01:20.649> pocket<00:01:20.890> than<00:01:21.159> formed

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really was a good pocket than formed

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.450 
really was a good pocket than formed
players<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.899> sat<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.320> place<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.040> they

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
players just sat in place and they

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.950 
players just sat in place and they
fought<00:01:24.700> back<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:24.909> forth<00:01:25.240> offensive<00:01:25.750> line<00:01:25.869> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
fought back and forth offensive line of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.840 
fought back and forth offensive line of
defensive<00:01:26.350> line<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:27.159> we<00:01:27.310> knew<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:27.520> was<00:01:27.640> really

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
defensive line so we knew it was really

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.249 
defensive line so we knew it was really
key<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.180> us<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.420> kind<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.659> really<00:01:28.869> change<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
key for us to kind of really change the

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.690 
key for us to kind of really change the
way<00:01:29.290> madden<00:01:29.649> was<00:01:29.770> play<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.040> was<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.159> former<00:01:30.520> real

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
way madden was play it was a former real

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.670 
way madden was play it was a former real
pocket<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.600> we<00:01:31.689> have<00:01:31.840> animations<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:32.470> this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
pocket so we have animations like this

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.880 
pocket so we have animations like this
where<00:01:32.890> they<00:01:32.979> kind<00:01:33.189> of<00:01:33.220> drive<00:01:33.579> around<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.000> edge

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
where they kind of drive around the edge

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.560 
where they kind of drive around the edge
so<00:01:35.890> he<00:01:36.070> added<00:01:36.369> those<00:01:36.549> you<00:01:36.909> know<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.330> took<00:01:37.509> a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
so he added those you know that took a

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.730 
so he added those you know that took a
little<00:01:37.689> bit<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.929> time<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:38.259> had<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> redo<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> lot

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
little bit of time we had a redo a lot

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.440 
little bit of time we had a redo a lot
our<00:01:38.950> blocking<00:01:39.159> system<00:01:39.460> but<00:01:39.789> it<00:01:40.149> wasn't

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
our blocking system but it wasn't

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.050 
our blocking system but it wasn't
dynamic<00:01:40.929> so<00:01:41.619> using<00:01:41.830> protag<00:01:42.369> we<00:01:42.700> brought<00:01:42.939> over

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
dynamic so using protag we brought over

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.490 
dynamic so using protag we brought over
the<00:01:43.240> same<00:01:43.420> technology<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.080> allow<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.289> to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
the same technology to allow you to

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.679 
the same technology to allow you to
manipulate<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:45.100> animation<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:45.880> blade<00:01:46.090> so

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
manipulate this animation as it blade so

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.210 
manipulate this animation as it blade so
you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.929> steer<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.409> animation<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:48.189> a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
you can steer this animation as a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.219 
you can steer this animation as a
defender<00:01:48.729> if<00:01:49.030> you're<00:01:49.210> playing<00:01:49.390> as<00:01:49.689> a<00:01:49.720> user<00:01:49.959> or

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
defender if you're playing as a user or

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.949 
defender if you're playing as a user or
the<00:01:50.369> CPU<00:01:51.369> based<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.060> their<00:01:52.240> ratings<00:01:52.600> will<00:01:52.810> end

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
the CPU based on their ratings will end

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.169 
the CPU based on their ratings will end
up<00:01:53.080> actually<00:01:53.259> steering<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:53.950> tighter<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.909> if

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
up actually steering it tighter so if

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.639 
up actually steering it tighter so if
this<00:01:55.330> guys<00:01:55.509> are<00:01:55.690> really<00:01:55.840> elite<00:01:56.200> defensive

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
this guys are really elite defensive

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.990 
this guys are really elite defensive
lineman<00:01:56.979> he<00:01:57.069> can<00:01:57.220> drive<00:01:57.429> this<00:01:57.640> animation

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
lineman he can drive this animation

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.660 
lineman he can drive this animation
right<00:01:58.330> back<00:01:58.509> into<00:01:58.690> my<00:01:58.899> quarterback<00:01:59.530> space<00:01:59.830> you

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
right back into my quarterback space you

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.859 
right back into my quarterback space you
really<00:02:00.909> changes<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.299> way<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.450> pockets

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
really changes the way the pockets

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.230 
really changes the way the pockets
formed<00:02:02.259> dynamically<00:02:02.770> instead<00:02:03.190> of<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:04.209> know

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
formed dynamically instead of you know

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.880 
formed dynamically instead of you know
having<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.049> just<00:02:05.259> select<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.770> different

the ticker we're trying to just be a lot

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.229 
the ticker we're trying to just be a lot
more<00:02:44.650> minimalistic<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:45.579> when<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:45.850> do<00:02:46.000> stuff

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
more minimalistic here when we do stuff

like I said is authenticity you know
we've<00:02:51.040> got<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.880> Super<00:02:52.180> Bowl

six just new things just here alone you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.559 
six just new things just here alone you
know<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.549> can<00:02:57.730> definitely<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.209> over<00:02:58.420> there

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
know you can definitely see over there

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.479 
know you can definitely see over there
the<00:02:58.780> chain<00:02:59.079> gang<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.440> back<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.709> referees<00:03:00.340> are

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the chain gang is back the referees are

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.759 
the chain gang is back the referees are
back<00:03:00.660> these<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.810> never<00:03:01.989> been<00:03:02.170> existing<00:03:02.470> on

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
back these have never been existing on

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.250 
back these have never been existing on
on<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.459> next-gen<00:03:03.819> platforms<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.079> guess

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
on the next-gen platforms or I guess

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.289 
on the next-gen platforms or I guess
current<00:03:05.590> gen<00:03:05.739> now<00:03:05.889> we<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.549> seven<00:03:06.880> referees

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
current gen now we have seven referees

current gen now we have seven referees
now<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.600> used<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.989> only<00:03:08.109> have<00:03:08.290> five<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.859> we

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
now we used to only have five so we

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.470 
now we used to only have five so we
actually<00:03:09.069> have<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> real<00:03:09.489> NFL<00:03:10.090> officiating

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
feel was the game speed itself you know

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.480 
feel was the game speed itself you know
Madden<00:03:58.650> over<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.890> years<00:03:59.040> has<00:03:59.100> just<00:03:59.370> been

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
Madden over the years has just been

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.830 
Madden over the years has just been
progressively<00:03:59.970> getting<00:04:00.180> faster<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.780> faster

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
progressively getting faster and faster

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.020 
progressively getting faster and faster
and<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:02.010> year<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.310> dropped<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.700> way<00:04:02.820> back

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
and this year we dropped it way back

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.030 
and this year we dropped it way back
down<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.540> we<00:04:03.600> tried<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.230> time<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.590> accurately

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
down and we tried to time it accurately

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.300 
down and we tried to time it accurately
to<00:04:05.310> real<00:04:05.700> NFL<00:04:05.940> speeds<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:07.710> really<00:04:08.040> get<00:04:08.190> it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to real NFL speeds and really get it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.130 
to real NFL speeds and really get it
dead-on<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.240> time<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.630> takes<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:09.960> your

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
dead-on so the time it takes from your

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.930 
dead-on so the time it takes from your
quarterback<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.620> take<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.800> snap<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.340> set<00:04:11.580> up<00:04:11.730> is

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
quarterback to take a snap and set up is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.480 
quarterback to take a snap and set up is
dead<00:04:12.150> on<00:04:12.270> time<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.050> takes<00:04:13.140> for<00:04:13.350> him<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.530> when

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
dead on time it takes for him to when

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.890 
dead on time it takes for him to when
you<00:04:14.580> hit<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.850> throw<00:04:15.030> button<00:04:15.300> so<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.450> wind<00:04:15.750> up

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
you hit the throw button so it wind up

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.199 
you hit the throw button so it wind up
and<00:04:16.109> release<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.530> ball<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.859> dead<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:18.120> we

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and release the ball is dead on and we

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.759 
and release the ball is dead on and we
even<00:04:18.330> have<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.690> /<00:04:18.900> quarterback<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.590> every

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
even have that / quarterback so every

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.979 
even have that / quarterback so every
quarterback<00:04:20.040> has<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.760> throwing<00:04:21.690> style

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
quarterback has a throwing style

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.659 
quarterback has a throwing style
animation<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:22.830> matches<00:04:23.190> what<00:04:23.220> he<00:04:23.400> does<00:04:23.550> in

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
animation that matches what he does in

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.700 
animation that matches what he does in
real<00:04:23.700> life<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.930> have<00:04:25.050> specific

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
real life and so you have specific

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.200 
real life and so you have specific
advantages<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.310> disadvantages<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.030> some

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
advantages and disadvantages to some

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.670 
advantages and disadvantages to some
quarterbacks<00:04:27.510> they<00:04:28.169> release<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> ball

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
quarterbacks they release the ball

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.140 
quarterbacks they release the ball
faster<00:04:29.100> but<00:04:29.280> maybe<00:04:29.430> they<00:04:29.550> release<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.850> lower

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
faster but maybe they release it lower

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.270 
faster but maybe they release it lower
it<00:04:30.810> gets<00:04:30.960> tipped<00:04:31.169> at<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.350> line<00:04:31.440> will<00:04:31.830> have<00:04:32.010> a

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
it gets tipped at the line will have a

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.580 
it gets tipped at the line will have a
little<00:04:32.610> quick<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.940> little<00:04:33.180> easier<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:33.870> you're
