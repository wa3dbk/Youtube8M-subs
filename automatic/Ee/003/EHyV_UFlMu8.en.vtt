00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
packaging not so good

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.080

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
basically what they did was put some

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically what they did was put some
bubble<00:01:06.240> wrap<00:01:06.390> around<00:01:06.870> there<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.970> take

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
bubble wrap around there and then take

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.820 
bubble wrap around there and then take
it<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.750> slap<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> label<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it up and they just slap the label on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.120 
it up and they just slap the label on
there<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.300> wasn't<00:01:12.690> really<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.290> secure<00:01:13.800> no

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
there so it wasn't really to secure no

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.910 
there so it wasn't really to secure no
box<00:01:14.370> no<00:01:14.670> nothing<00:01:15.229> that's<00:01:16.229> why<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.620> cracked

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
box no nothing that's why it's cracked

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.640 
box no nothing that's why it's cracked
when<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> came<00:01:17.640> in

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
when it came in

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
when it came in
it's<00:01:19.650> crack<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:22.369> they<00:01:23.369> was

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's crack right here there they was

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's crack right here there they was
coming<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> guess<00:01:25.440> what<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
coming off but you know I guess what you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.650 
coming off but you know I guess what you
get<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> pay<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:29.030> for<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> label

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
get what you pay for for the label

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.830 
get what you pay for for the label
I<00:01:30.690> guess<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.140> copied<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.090> spiderwire<00:01:33.090> brain

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I guess they copied the spiderwire brain

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.980 
I guess they copied the spiderwire brain
label<00:01:34.790> don't<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.970> why<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.330> don't<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.660> sued

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
label don't know why they don't get sued

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
label don't know why they don't get sued
but<00:01:39.080> who<00:01:40.080> knows<00:01:40.290> um<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.869> 1,000<00:01:43.320> meters<00:01:43.970> as<00:01:44.970> for

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
but who knows um so 1,000 meters as for

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.690 
but who knows um so 1,000 meters as for
the<00:01:45.720> diameter<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> thing<00:01:46.800> they<00:01:47.070> claim<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the diameter of the thing they claim it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.919 
the diameter of the thing they claim it
is<00:01:48.000> 0.4<00:01:48.899> t<00:01:49.250> millimeters<00:01:50.479> compared<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> power

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
is 0.4 t millimeters compared to power

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.010 
is 0.4 t millimeters compared to power
pearl<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.440> would<00:01:52.800> say<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.910> isn't<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.929> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
pearl I would say this isn't really that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
pearl I would say this isn't really that
thin<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.979> power<00:01:56.220> probably<00:01:56.610> equivalent<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
thin the power probably equivalent I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.749 
thin the power probably equivalent I
would<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:57.929> like<00:01:58.170> 80<00:01:58.350> pounds<00:01:58.759> so

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
would say it would be like 80 pounds so

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.870 
would say it would be like 80 pounds so
this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.459> more<00:02:02.459> thick<00:02:02.819> than<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:04.880> branded

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this is more thick than your branded

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.529 
this is more thick than your branded
braids<00:02:06.690> like<00:02:07.080> powerful<00:02:08.149> Berkley<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.360> that

ice pulled up a to Savalas wheel

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.460 
ice pulled up a to Savalas wheel
this<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.680> one<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.100> size<00:02:31.420> 7,000<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.660> this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
this one one of the size 7,000 and this

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.170 
this one one of the size 7,000 and this
is<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.860> looks<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.870> right<00:02:35.870> there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.050 

doesn't<00:02:41.180> look<00:02:41.830> doesn't<00:02:42.830> look<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.310> great<00:02:43.459> but

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.660 

not<00:02:47.060> bad

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
not bad

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.280

so<00:02:49.670> after<00:02:50.030> spooling<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.630> up<00:02:52.780> fold<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:54.020> this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
so after spooling that up fold up this

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:15.160 
so after spooling that up fold up this
is<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> 5000<00:02:55.190> size<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:13.720> after<00:03:14.720> filling<00:03:15.019> up

bunch<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.239> line<00:03:20.420> left<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.980> for<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.280> price<00:03:22.640> I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
bunch of line left so for that price I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.750 
bunch of line left so for that price I
guess<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:24.320> mean<00:03:24.860> as<00:03:25.010> long<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.459> don't<00:03:25.550> lose

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
guess you mean as long as you don't lose
