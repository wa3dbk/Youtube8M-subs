00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
going to work I'm gonna break it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.529 
going to work I'm gonna break it
straight<00:00:23.460> don't<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> worry

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
straight don't want to have to worry

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
straight don't want to have to worry
about<00:00:24.689> any<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.019> stuff<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.250> why

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
about any of that stuff so that's why

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.099 
about any of that stuff so that's why
I'm<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> that's<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> do

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
I'm here and that's what I do

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.910 
I'm here and that's what I do
and<00:00:28.560> basically<00:00:29.660> Carlos<00:00:30.660> uses<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.199> 3-way

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and basically Carlos uses a 3-way

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
and basically Carlos uses a 3-way
amplifier<00:00:32.910> system<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.380> he's<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.680> two

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
amplifier system and so he's got two

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790 
amplifier system and so he's got two
four<00:00:35.130> by<00:00:35.160> 12<00:00:35.610> speakers<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> stage<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.440> small

mark one boogie combo it's actually an

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
mark one boogie combo it's actually an

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
that much cable capacitance it helps

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
a little bit more mellow so that's a

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.759 
a little bit more mellow so that's a
good<00:03:51.500> thing

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
little bit too harsh maybe get a little

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.880 
little bit too harsh maybe get a little
bit<00:03:56.599> longer<00:03:56.840> cable<00:03:57.349> or<00:03:57.470> something<00:03:57.739> like<00:03:57.829> that
