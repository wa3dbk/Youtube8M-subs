and I thought boy if we could move up to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
and I thought boy if we could move up to
a<00:02:03.600> five<00:02:03.810> sixty<00:02:04.320> we'd<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.920> doing

something but we'd never did we never

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.520 
something but we'd never did we never
got<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> five<00:02:07.799> sixty<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.690> put

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
got the five sixty but we just put

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.809

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.580 
and tried to keep up with the 560 that's
what<00:02:14.400> we<00:02:14.489> tried<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.999> I<00:02:15.030> guess<00:02:15.590> permissibly

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
what we tried to do I guess permissibly

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.979 
what we tried to do I guess permissibly
what<00:02:16.799> was<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> horsepower<00:02:17.519> on<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.909> 560<00:02:18.599> well
