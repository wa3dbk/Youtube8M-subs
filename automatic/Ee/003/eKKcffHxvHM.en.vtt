rebellion<00:05:54.560> I<00:05:54.800> guess<00:05:55.130> now's<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.580> part<00:05:55.760> where

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
rebellion I guess now's the part where

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.510 
rebellion I guess now's the part where
I'd<00:05:56.060> say<00:05:56.360> if<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.870> liked<00:05:57.140> X<00:05:57.410> or<00:05:57.650> Y<00:05:57.830> you<00:05:58.370> should

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
I'd say if you liked X or Y you should

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.910 
I'd say if you liked X or Y you should
watch<00:05:58.670> Fatima<00:05:59.240> inverted<00:05:59.780> but<00:06:00.170> honestly<00:06:00.590> I

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920 
watch Fatima inverted but honestly I

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.220
