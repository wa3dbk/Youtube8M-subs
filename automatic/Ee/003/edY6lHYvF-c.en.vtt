really<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.850> simple<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:07.010> showing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
really it's a very simple way of showing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.940 
really it's a very simple way of showing
dangerous<00:01:08.610> areas<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.229> almost

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
dangerous areas on the way it's almost

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.990 
dangerous areas on the way it's almost
sort<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.049> sort<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> literal<00:01:14.000> expansion

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sort of like a sort of literal expansion

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320 
sort of like a sort of literal expansion
on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> whole<00:01:15.799> days<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.979> wow<00:01:17.189> move<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that work because that the whole combat

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
that work because that the whole combat

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
targeted thing ya gotta the account you
can<00:02:04.320> tap<00:02:04.530> target<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.880> can't<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.299> target<00:02:06.659> but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
can tap target you can't have target but

can tap target you can't have target but
it<00:02:06.899> won't<00:02:07.110> actually<00:02:07.320> help<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.950> adjust<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
it won't actually help you adjust it

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.020 
it won't actually help you adjust it
a<00:02:08.590> way<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.890> highlighting<00:02:09.220> where<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.759> enemies

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
a way of highlighting where the enemies

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.460 
a way of highlighting where the enemies
are<00:02:10.060> yeah<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.630> you've<00:02:10.780> actually<00:02:10.869> got<00:02:11.230> an<00:02:11.319> aim

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
are yeah so you've actually got an aim

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.800 
are yeah so you've actually got an aim
yeah<00:02:12.370> you've<00:02:12.670> actually<00:02:12.880> got<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.330> aim<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.690> it's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
yeah you've actually got to aim so it's

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.420 
yeah you've actually got to aim so it's
more<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.110> skill-shot<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.800> her<00:02:14.980> score<00:02:15.220> shot

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
more of a skill-shot like her score shot

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.240 
more of a skill-shot like her score shot
would<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.790> Lowell<00:02:16.030> yeah<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:17.160> anything<00:02:18.160> or

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
would be in Lowell yeah or anything or

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.490 
would be in Lowell yeah or anything or
just<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.670> first<00:02:18.910> person<00:02:19.060> shooter<00:02:19.239> kind<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.750> you

just a first person shooter kind of you
know<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:21.550> Barfield<00:02:21.970> three<00:02:22.209> yeah<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.230> mean<00:02:23.410> I

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
know in Barfield three yeah so I mean I

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.979 
know in Barfield three yeah so I mean I
guess<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.370> big<00:02:25.000> worry<00:02:25.269> or<00:02:25.599> i

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
guess the the the the big worry or i

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.000 
guess the the the the big worry or i
guess<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.680> worry<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.180> community<00:02:28.660> or<00:02:29.019> anyone

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
guess a worry of the community or anyone

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.040 
guess a worry of the community or anyone
looking<00:02:30.459> at<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.790> game<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.209> perhaps<00:02:31.569> and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
looking at this game is that perhaps and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.690 
looking at this game is that perhaps and
from<00:02:32.830> what<00:02:32.980> we've<00:02:33.130> seen<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.430> videos

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
from what we've seen in videos

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.600 
from what we've seen in videos
especially<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.769> telegraphing<00:02:35.769> system<00:02:36.190> could

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
especially the telegraphing system could

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.809 
especially the telegraphing system could
arguably<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.180> conceived<00:02:37.959> as<00:02:38.610> make<00:02:39.610> a

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
arguably be conceived as make a

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.229 
arguably be conceived as make a
simplifying<00:02:40.540> combat<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.970> level

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
simplifying combat to the to the level

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.390 
simplifying combat to the to the level
of<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.630> don't<00:02:43.870> stand<00:02:44.019> here<00:02:44.170> stand<00:02:44.890> here<00:02:45.100> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
of just don't stand here stand here and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.539 
of just don't stand here stand here and
it's<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:46.840> know<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.620> little<00:02:48.010> bit<00:02:48.220> too<00:02:48.370> easy

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
it's you know it's a little bit too easy

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's you know it's a little bit too easy
mode<00:02:48.819> but<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> mean<00:02:49.470> yeah<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.890> think<00:02:51.160> about

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
mode but I mean yeah do you think about

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.180 
mode but I mean yeah do you think about
that<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:53.440> worried<00:02:53.799> about<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.069> when<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that and I was worried about it when I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.190 
that and I was worried about it when I
first<00:02:54.430> saw<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> videos<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.060> came<00:02:55.510> out<00:02:55.660> but

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
first saw the videos that came out but

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.229 
first saw the videos that came out but
then<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.410> realized<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.730> was<00:02:57.819> explained

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
then I realized and that was explained

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.600 
then I realized and that was explained
that<00:02:58.599> actually<00:02:59.200> these<00:02:59.319> levels<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.860> these

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
that actually these levels of these

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.460 
that actually these levels of these
areas<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.209> read<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> low<00:03:01.599> level<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
areas of read a low level so in the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.500 
areas of read a low level so in the
first<00:03:02.620> videos<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.430> came<00:03:03.610> out<00:03:03.819> yeah<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
first videos that came out yeah the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.789 
first videos that came out yeah the
first<00:03:04.690> videos<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.080> came<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.560> up<00:03:05.620> and

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
first videos that came out and up and

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.140 
first videos that came out and up and
the<00:03:05.890> developers<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.549> running<00:03:06.849> around<00:03:06.940> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
the developers just running around the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.720 
the developers just running around the
kind<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.390> first<00:03:07.630> zone<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.280> also<00:03:09.489> it's

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
kind of first zone and and also it's

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.520 
kind of first zone and and also it's
basically<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.180> like<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.750> any<00:03:10.959> other<00:03:11.080> MMO

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
basically just like in any other MMO

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.560 
basically just like in any other MMO
where<00:03:11.739> your<00:03:11.920> your<00:03:12.280> face<00:03:13.000> with<00:03:13.239> your<00:03:13.299> first

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
where your your face with your first

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.420 
where your your face with your first
enemies<00:03:13.959> from<00:03:14.079> there<00:03:14.290> absolutely<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:15.280> know

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
enemies from there absolutely you know

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.030 
enemies from there absolutely you know
path<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.269> easy<00:03:16.510> obviously<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.680> end<00:03:17.920> because

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
path but easy obviously the end because

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.789 
path but easy obviously the end because
they<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:20.320> what<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
they have to be and but what the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.160 
they have to be and but what the
developers<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.579> said<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:22.900> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
developers have said is is that is the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.870 
developers have said is is that is the
path<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.769> know<00:03:23.890> your<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.370> talk<00:03:24.609> obviously

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
path in you know your and talk obviously

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.789 
path in you know your and talk obviously
how<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.359> see<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.900> Telegraph's<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.470> use<00:03:26.650> them

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
how to see the Telegraph's and use them

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.920 
how to see the Telegraph's and use them
and<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.400> after<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.450> casting

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and get out the way after that casting

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.140 
and get out the way after that casting
term<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.560> know<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.890> enemies<00:03:30.549> have<00:03:30.730> reduced

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
term you know on enemies have reduced

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
term you know on enemies have reduced
and<00:03:31.450> they<00:03:32.049> don't<00:03:32.170> always<00:03:32.530> do<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.859> same<00:03:33.069> skill

complicated they can get halfway through

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.390 
complicated they can get halfway through
the<00:04:34.620> game<00:04:34.770> nice<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.870> yeah<00:04:37.110> I'm<00:04:37.710> not<00:04:38.220> too

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
the game nice so yeah I'm not too

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.150 
the game nice so yeah I'm not too
concerned<00:04:38.610> about<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:39.000> because<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:40.080> see

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
concerned about it because I can see

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.560 
concerned about it because I can see
that<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.280> could<00:04:41.430> get<00:04:41.550> very<00:04:41.610> complicated<00:04:41.970> and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that it could get very complicated and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.130 
that it could get very complicated and
the<00:04:43.230> beginning<00:04:44.220> stages<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:45.030> were<00:04:45.510> meant<00:04:45.990> to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
the beginning stages of it were meant to

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.050 
the beginning stages of it were meant to
be<00:04:46.170> teaching<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.710> how<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.920> use<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.580> systems

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
be teaching you how to use the systems

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.320 
be teaching you how to use the systems
but<00:04:48.930> also<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.260> mean<00:04:49.790> although<00:04:50.790> it's<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.240> know

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
but also I mean although it's you know

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.000 
but also I mean although it's you know
it's<00:04:51.360> great<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.780> see<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.710> know<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
it's great to see that you know the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.410 
it's great to see that you know the
enemies<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.640> can<00:04:53.790> see<00:04:53.970> where<00:04:54.120> all<00:04:54.330> that

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
enemies can you can see where all that

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.420 
enemies can you can see where all that
kind<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.630> stuff<00:04:54.690> is<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:56.040> also<00:04:56.190> very

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
kind of stuff is and it's also very

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.820 
kind of stuff is and it's also very
useful<00:04:56.520> for<00:04:56.820> your<00:04:57.030> party<00:04:57.600> because<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.230> what

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
useful for your party because and what

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.350 
useful for your party because and what
they're<00:04:58.980> trying<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.310> go<00:04:59.430> for<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.790> an<00:04:59.940> instant

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
they're trying to go for is an instant

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.970 
they're trying to go for is an instant
way<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.570> communicating<00:05:01.080> what<00:05:01.410> you're<00:05:01.590> doing

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
way of communicating what you're doing

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.060 
way of communicating what you're doing
and<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:03.270> for<00:05:03.540> example<00:05:03.630> if<00:05:04.320> there's<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:05.900> healer

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
and so for example if there's a healer

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.890 
and so for example if there's a healer
they<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.100> cast<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.820> kind<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:09.150> air<00:05:09.360> we<00:05:09.540> effect

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
they can cast some kind of air we effect

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.930 
they can cast some kind of air we effect
and<00:05:10.140> because<00:05:10.980> obviously<00:05:11.250> people<00:05:11.520> could<00:05:11.730> see

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
and because obviously people could see

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.000 
and because obviously people could see
that<00:05:12.090> being<00:05:12.150> cast<00:05:12.750> in<00:05:12.930> a<00:05:13.020> certain<00:05:13.200> area<00:05:13.410> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
that being cast in a certain area the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.070 
that being cast in a certain area the
team<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.490> move<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:14.730> that<00:05:14.970> area<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.330> then<00:05:15.600> get<00:05:15.840> a

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
team can move to that area to then get a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.340 
team can move to that area to then get a
heel<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.850> before<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.030> Telegraph<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.720> you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
heel and before the Telegraph is you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.710 
heel and before the Telegraph is you
know<00:05:19.470> before<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.190> ability<00:05:20.610> hits<00:05:20.850> us<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.540> say

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
know before the ability hits us to say

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600 
know before the ability hits us to say
so<00:05:22.440> there<00:05:22.890> are<00:05:23.010> loads<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.220> different<00:05:23.340> stuff

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
so there are loads of different stuff

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.040 
so there are loads of different stuff
like<00:05:23.730> that<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:23.910> i'm<00:05:24.390> not<00:05:24.660> sure<00:05:24.720> if<00:05:24.930> they're

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
like that and i'm not sure if they're

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.650 
like that and i'm not sure if they're
going<00:05:25.140> to<00:05:25.290> add<00:05:25.560> comboing<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:27.150> it

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
going to add comboing in but and it

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.900 
going to add comboing in but and it
opens<00:05:28.170> that<00:05:28.350> whole<00:05:28.500> thing<00:05:28.710> up<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:29.010> comboing<00:05:29.370> so

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
opens that whole thing up to comboing so

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.540 
opens that whole thing up to comboing so
you<00:05:29.970> can<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.740> know<00:05:31.860> connect<00:05:32.190> with<00:05:32.370> all

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
you can you know connect with all

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.160 
you can you know connect with all
players<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.090> know<00:05:33.330> what<00:05:33.600> they're<00:05:33.750> doing<00:05:34.050> with

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
players I know what they're doing with

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.000 
players I know what they're doing with
them<00:05:34.520> they've<00:05:35.520> got<00:05:35.670> a<00:05:35.970> crowd<00:05:36.360> control<00:05:36.720> and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
them they've got a crowd control and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.130 
them they've got a crowd control and
shield<00:05:38.010> system<00:05:38.570> where<00:05:39.570> they<00:05:39.870> talked<00:05:40.080> about

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
shield system where they talked about

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.970 
shield system where they talked about
like<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.530> rest<00:05:40.710> video<00:05:40.980> as<00:05:41.100> well<00:05:41.130> aware<00:05:41.430> and

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
like the rest video as well aware and

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.080 
like the rest video as well aware and
the<00:05:43.520> telegraphing<00:05:44.090> helps<00:05:44.360> you<00:05:44.650> take<00:05:45.650> down

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
the telegraphing helps you take down

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.120 
the telegraphing helps you take down
your<00:05:47.090> crowd<00:05:47.420> control<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:47.810> boss<00:05:48.500> for<00:05:48.770> example

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
your crowd control a boss for example

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.980 
your crowd control a boss for example
because<00:05:49.280> bosses<00:05:49.670> aren't<00:05:49.910> immune<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.780> crowd

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
because bosses aren't immune to crowd

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.500 
because bosses aren't immune to crowd
control<00:05:51.020> like<00:05:51.590> they<00:05:51.770> are<00:05:51.890> in<00:05:52.070> other<00:05:52.280> MMOs<00:05:52.940> what

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
control like they are in other MMOs what

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.480 
control like they are in other MMOs what
happens<00:05:53.840> is<00:05:53.990> people<00:05:54.200> have<00:05:54.620> people<00:05:54.980> and<00:05:55.160> bosses

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
happens is people have people and bosses

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.150 
happens is people have people and bosses
have<00:05:55.760> crowd<00:05:56.030> control<00:05:56.390> armor<00:05:56.780> basically<00:05:57.710> we're

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
have crowd control armor basically we're

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.220 
have crowd control armor basically we're
basically<00:05:58.520> you<00:05:58.700> can<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:59.120> can<00:05:59.270> resist<00:05:59.630> three

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
basically you can you can resist three

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.550 
basically you can you can resist three
attempts<00:06:01.040> at<00:06:01.130> crowd<00:06:01.340> control<00:06:01.700> upon<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.120> and

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
attempts at crowd control upon you and

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.900 
attempts at crowd control upon you and
which<00:06:03.560> then<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:04.040> shield<00:06:04.280> with<00:06:04.490> charges

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
which then that shield with charges

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.370 
which then that shield with charges
right<00:06:05.690> area<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.290> short<00:06:07.130> amount<00:06:07.220> of<00:06:07.370> time<00:06:07.430> and

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
right area a short amount of time and

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.980 
right area a short amount of time and
but<00:06:09.380> if<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.700> fourth<00:06:10.940> one<00:06:11.210> for<00:06:11.390> example<00:06:11.810> you

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
but if on the fourth one for example you

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.470 
but if on the fourth one for example you
would<00:06:12.770> then<00:06:12.920> be<00:06:13.100> crowd<00:06:13.370> control<00:06:13.730> and<00:06:13.910> you'd<00:06:14.330> be

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
would then be crowd control and you'd be

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.000 
would then be crowd control and you'd be
stoned<00:06:14.750> or<00:06:14.990> we'd<00:06:15.350> lose<00:06:15.530> your<00:06:15.710> weapon<00:06:15.950> or

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
the other side of that you can use that

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.670 
the other side of that you can use that
on<00:06:20.210> buses<00:06:20.600> as<00:06:20.720> well<00:06:20.870> as<00:06:20.960> our<00:06:21.110> boss<00:06:21.290> will<00:06:21.500> have<00:06:21.650> a

for getting out certain attacks out

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.110 
for getting out certain attacks out
cover<00:06:35.150> to<00:06:35.270> imagine<00:06:35.630> yeah<00:06:36.280> so<00:06:37.280> all<00:06:37.700> in<00:06:37.970> all<00:06:38.060> I

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
cover to imagine yeah so all in all I

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.020 
cover to imagine yeah so all in all I
mean<00:06:38.390> it's<00:06:39.020> it's<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.770> lot<00:06:40.370> more<00:06:40.400> complex<00:06:40.880> than

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
mean it's it's a lot more complex than

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.640 
mean it's it's a lot more complex than
it<00:06:41.180> initially<00:06:41.300> looks<00:06:41.840> I<00:06:42.170> guess<00:06:42.470> the

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
it initially looks I guess the

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.210 
it initially looks I guess the
telegraphing<00:06:43.190> system<00:06:44.080> yes<00:06:45.080> well<00:06:45.650> it's<00:06:45.950> very

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
telegraphing system yes well it's very

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.570 
telegraphing system yes well it's very
simple<00:06:46.660> but<00:06:47.660> it<00:06:47.810> gets<00:06:47.990> a<00:06:48.260> lot<00:06:48.380> more<00:06:48.440> yeah<00:06:49.280> and

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
simple but it gets a lot more yeah and

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.850 
simple but it gets a lot more yeah and
it's<00:06:50.480> walking<00:06:50.900> that<00:06:51.020> fine<00:06:51.260> line<00:06:51.320> isn't<00:06:51.560> it

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
it's walking that fine line isn't it

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.710 
it's walking that fine line isn't it
really<00:06:52.070> between<00:06:52.280> you<00:06:52.820> know<00:06:52.940> making<00:06:53.150> a<00:06:53.360> system

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
really between you know making a system

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.660 
really between you know making a system
that<00:06:53.870> makes<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.260> combat<00:06:54.620> system<00:06:54.800> you<00:06:55.520> know

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
that makes the combat system you know

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.780 
that makes the combat system you know
simple<00:06:56.090> and<00:06:56.240> intuitive<00:06:56.480> yet<00:06:56.990> have<00:06:57.170> depth<00:06:57.500> and

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
simple and intuitive yet have depth and

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.910 
simple and intuitive yet have depth and
just<00:06:58.790> making<00:06:58.970> it<00:06:59.180> a<00:06:59.210> complete<00:06:59.450> face<00:06:59.750> roll<00:06:59.990> yes

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920 
just making it a complete face roll yes

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.250 
just making it a complete face roll yes
exactly<00:07:01.100> so<00:07:01.490> the<00:07:02.000> question<00:07:02.360> is<00:07:02.450> does<00:07:02.780> you<00:07:03.170> know

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
exactly so the question is does you know
