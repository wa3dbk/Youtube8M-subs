00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.610
 I grew a lot of video was seasoning 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 sowing seeds and about picking and about them 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 it means rooting the tops 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.449
 black dragon and velvet night wanted 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.629
 see the difference but no difference 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 I saw it almost nothing 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.479
 these two wheels 1 are different from one 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.380
 here they all grew up 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 Now I will be there too soon 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 tops rooting many in my 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 transplanted on the garden outside here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 such a velvet night i don't call i call 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.049
 their black dragon don't know who called them 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.229
 work at nights it's probably just already 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.670
 call just to call I do not know 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 the difference did not see the following at all 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 gavrish coleus original such i 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.100
 I planted two bags but unfortunately from 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.470
 these sachets of these sachets are not 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 none of what has grown here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.799
 drawn i'm very sorry i shot them 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.790
 on the street now they are all planted with me 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.280
 on the street they are all there brown tones 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.780
 there are none of these 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.569
 one on this I already saw exactly 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.480
 Here's an example I have left of these 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.510
 seed house here such here 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 the top and such here are the rest in 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.080
 heart in the street and filmed them 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.140
 I'll take off later as they grew up some 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.030
 there they grow mail and but I want to take off 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.550
 Show them what videos they are after all. 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.140
 have grown 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.940
 further somehow seki cactus cay besieged 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.150
 twice 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.780
 first seeds for the seeds of Ukraine 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.209
 and here agropak cacti so far about them 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.600
 I can tell what they grew up because 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.930
 that they are still small is not all that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.010
 I have, they still stand out 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.209
 other venues 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:04.569
 Well, while there are such prickles in appearance, they 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.100
 of course there are various hope that 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.560
 anything 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.310
 grow interesting and then I sat down 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:17.320
 I ordered a melon, we already shot about them 3 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.480
 I made 3 videos and now I'll show them three 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.420
 half a month in this condition 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.730
 now they are only one baby he is ok he is not 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:31.320
 wants to grow hard but I support him 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.980
 here in his life they are now 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:41.320
 adenine and further planted seed begonias 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:45.269
 Begonias here are two shanson coolers 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.110
 red bill and bill I still such a sad 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:53.400
 Here they grew 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.550
 of course I can hardly work them too 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.380
 nursed 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.400
 Now I have such grow 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.890
 begonias 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.560
 Now they do not bloom, they are increasing 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 probably there nodule because 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.480
 mystics they are now such here 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.770
 released such here it turns out 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.190
 ampelous 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.440
 here's hanging in that state from me 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:30.520
 Now I planted these begonias too 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:34.510
 in the spring, further on, petunias were all 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.440
 in the python of this company I do not even know how 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.820
 it is called the seeds 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:47.580
 with such a logo otherwise you or such 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:51.490
 This in my opinion is a saying you say yes 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.490
 here I have I filmed on video 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.610
 the balcony is so worth it and now I have it all 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.270
 petunias they grew up here you are 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:07.470
 yes it looks like all these pictures and they 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:10.750
 Now here, too, in the yard grow on the street 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.490
 here they are much better there than at my house 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.630
 because home is certainly not for everyone 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:23.230
 there is not enough place also with tomatoes 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:27.730
 which I grew all of them now 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:31.030
 on the street, too, in the garden now of them 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.260
 I have already tried the red ones very tasty 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.390
 sweet they are just like cherries there 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.290
 wonderful tomatoes rest 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:45.300
 that all green i'm taking hopefully video 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:48.330
 a little bit later, here I am planting passionflower 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.340
 I forgot to take a bag with passiflora 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 blue passionflower means I did 2 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.900
 sowing one sowing done at the end of winter 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.840
 here is from this sowing ram here is such here 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.560
 I grew beautiful I now put 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:11.470
 show closer is passionflower she now 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:15.730
 I have made them so uncomplicated 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.490
 from the wire the semi-circles are debts here and they 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.310
 i'm bound with them 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:26.860
 This is the older one. 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.880
 second crop they have such wonderful 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.760
 whiskers that they just 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.680
 weave everything in the world film give them 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.720
 must be set apart because they are for 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.630
 weave all the other plants like this 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.870
 I have them now 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.960
 passionflower and live here and that's all 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.140
 Today I wanted to tell you about 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.900
 Tomatoes I take off and about Coleus 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.690
