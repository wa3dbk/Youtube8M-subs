00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
so I can't give you a size comparison

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.330 
so I can't give you a size comparison
between<00:04:20.299> those<00:04:20.660> two<00:04:20.930> devices<00:04:21.079> but<00:04:21.709> I<00:04:21.769> can<00:04:22.070> tell

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
between those two devices but I can tell

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.730 
between those two devices but I can tell
you<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.550> from<00:04:22.850> looking<00:04:23.090> at<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.540> that<00:04:24.139> it's

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
you just from looking at it that it's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.860 
you just from looking at it that it's
very<00:04:25.070> similar<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.700> size<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.510> net<00:04:26.660> gear

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
very similar in size to the net gear

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.120 
very similar in size to the net gear
device<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:29.210> Roku<00:04:29.540> is<00:04:29.750> very<00:04:30.290> small<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.040> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
device and the Roku is very small so the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.540 
device and the Roku is very small so the
Roku<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.580> probably<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> little<00:04:32.300> bit<00:04:32.540> smaller

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
Roku is probably a little bit smaller

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.390 
Roku is probably a little bit smaller
but<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:34.790> looks<00:04:35.090> like<00:04:35.210> it's<00:04:35.630> not<00:04:36.139> as<00:04:36.470> tall<00:04:37.040> as

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
but this looks like it's not as tall as

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.870 
but this looks like it's not as tall as
a<00:04:37.430> Roku<00:04:38.350> anyway<00:04:39.350> here<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.800> have<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.400> d-link

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
a Roku anyway here you have the d-link

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.140 
a Roku anyway here you have the d-link
branding<00:04:41.480> it's<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:42.050> matte<00:04:42.290> plastic<00:04:42.980> it<00:04:43.790> seems
