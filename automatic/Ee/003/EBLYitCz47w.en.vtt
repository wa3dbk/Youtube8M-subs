00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.310
 Hello, how are we doing today? 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.389
 choker with chain and beads 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.940
 crystal for it we're going to use a 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.759
 chain that I have cut and I have 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.800
 put in milk and this already measure 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.260
 that you want the longest face or 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 shorter than having as you like 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.940
 and accounts of these that are crystal 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.240
 and we are going to put it in sticks 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.800
 of these that have the flat tip 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.800
 ok then I have gotten 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 the little sticks with four other beads 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.339
 two with three accounts and two with two 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.810
 accounts and two others with an account let's 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:53.560
 to use our pliers 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.200
 and we do not get down to work 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.900
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 look for the middle of the chain to go 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.090
 inserting 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.200
 then the easiest thing is to take the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200
 the two ends 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.710
 and the good the medium we're going to start with 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.710
 one of the 4 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.549
 let's cut a tad 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.549
 to make a ring 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.420
 you know we're here and now 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.420
 we make the ring 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 we take the chain through the center and the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.290
 we put the first 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.290
 and we close 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.829
 we do the same with the following 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.829
 we are not going to contribute a little 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 the bend 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.180
 what do we do 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.110
 Y 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.170
 and so we're going to continue with all the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.780
 things 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.970
 I put this chain it shows very well 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.040
 those at the inn 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.300
 there is much separation you will put 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.300
 a few centuries but that already depends 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.230
 let's continue putting 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.989
 it's a little bit more that I have a 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.989
 little long 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.360
 ah 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.300
 ah 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:09.840
 and we close and so they carry all and channels 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.840
 ok let's continue to put all 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.550
 Nothing is already finished, look at what 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.040
 nice are left 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.930
 ideal for this summer 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.520
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.030
 encourage them to do what you see that is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.910
 super simple and if you like my videos
