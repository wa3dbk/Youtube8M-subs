00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
the connectors from the housing the next

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.390 
the connectors from the housing the next
step<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.990> put<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> extensions<00:02:20.190> in

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
step was to go and put the extensions in

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.120 
step was to go and put the extensions in
and<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:20.970> I've<00:02:21.060> done<00:02:21.090> here<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:22.130> this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and that's what I've done here for this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.810 
and that's what I've done here for this
next<00:02:23.520> step<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> run<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.930> liter

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
next step we're going to run a liter

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.690 
next step we're going to run a liter
line<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.210> little<00:02:27.870> nut<00:02:28.290> tied<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.460> we're<00:02:29.610> going

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
line a little nut tied to it we're going

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.370 
line a little nut tied to it we're going
to<00:02:29.760> run<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> through<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.240> handlebars<00:02:30.750> just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
to run it through the handlebars just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.950 
to run it through the handlebars just
going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> feed<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.980> through<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> opening<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
going to feed it through the opening and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.460 
going to feed it through the opening and
let<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.890> drop<00:02:35.100> through<00:02:35.460> until<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.480> comes<00:02:37.230> out

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
let it drop through until it comes out

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.160 
let it drop through until it comes out
the<00:02:37.740> bottom<00:02:38.220> end<00:02:38.520> here<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:39.960> we're

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the bottom end here so you can see we're

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.770 
the bottom end here so you can see we're
done<00:02:40.470> now<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.800> fed<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.370> through<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:42.630> opening

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
done now I fed it through the opening

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.070 
done now I fed it through the opening
underneath<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.620> handlebar<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.080> we've

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
underneath the handlebar here and we've

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.260 
underneath the handlebar here and we've
come<00:02:46.320> out<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> bottom<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.000> next

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
come out at the bottom for this next

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.160 
come out at the bottom for this next
step<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.990> run<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.440> leader<00:02:50.040> line

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
step I'm going to run my leader line

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.950 
step I'm going to run my leader line
around<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:54.110> cabling<00:02:55.110> harness<00:02:55.860> cabling<00:02:56.400> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.820 
get this cabling through the handlebars
I<00:03:21.720> picked<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:22.620> some<00:03:22.950> lithium<00:03:23.370> grease<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:25.470> help

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
I picked up some lithium grease to help

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.199 
I picked up some lithium grease to help
in<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.670> process<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:28.050> just<00:03:28.709> apply<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.400> little

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
in the process so just apply a little

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.960 
in the process so just apply a little
bit<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.450> lithium<00:03:30.930> grease<00:03:31.580> on<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.600> tubing<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
bit of lithium grease on the tubing and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.320 
bit of lithium grease on the tubing and
as<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.150> work<00:03:36.390> your<00:03:36.660> way<00:03:36.900> through<00:03:38.090> piece<00:03:39.090> by

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
as you work your way through piece by

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.550 
as you work your way through piece by
piece<00:03:39.360> just<00:03:40.350> keep<00:03:40.530> applying<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:42.030> lithium<00:03:42.989> so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
piece just keep applying the lithium so

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.170 
piece just keep applying the lithium so
we're<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.860> start<00:03:44.160> at<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.670> end<00:03:44.910> we're

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
we're going to start at this end we're

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.330 
we're going to start at this end we're
going<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.390> push<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.930> little<00:03:46.140> bit<00:03:46.380> through<00:03:47.160> this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
going to push a little bit through this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.150 
going to push a little bit through this
end<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.880> as<00:03:48.780> we're<00:03:48.989> pushing<00:03:49.260> on<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.860> end

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
end and as we're pushing on this end

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.449 
end and as we're pushing on this end
we're<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.150> pulling<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
we're going to be pulling out of the

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.400 
we're going to be pulling out of the
other<00:03:53.910> end<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.600> I'll<00:03:54.720> show<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.959> what<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> mean

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
other end and I'll show you what I mean

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.930 
other end and I'll show you what I mean
in<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.860> second<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.310> apply<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:56.610> little<00:03:56.820> bit

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
in just a second and apply a little bit

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.000 
in just a second and apply a little bit
more<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.320> lithium<00:03:59.100> grease<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.709> idea

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
more of this lithium grease so the idea

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
more of this lithium grease so the idea
here<00:04:02.100> is<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.760> pull<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.780> leader<00:04:04.770> cable<00:04:05.520> as<00:04:05.730> I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
here is to pull on the leader cable as I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:16.819 
here is to pull on the leader cable as I
push<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:09.320> housing<00:04:10.320> through<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.910> handlebars

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.289 

just<00:04:17.190> keep<00:04:17.400> feeding<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:20.030> housing<00:04:21.030> through

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
just keep feeding the housing through

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.559 
just keep feeding the housing through
the<00:04:21.449> top<00:04:21.659> part<00:04:21.690> as<00:04:22.199> you<00:04:22.800> pull<00:04:23.330> before<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.419> know

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
the top part as you pull before you know

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:41.869 
the top part as you pull before you know
it<00:04:24.690> you'll<00:04:25.620> be<00:04:26.629> out<00:04:27.629> with<00:04:27.960> thee<00:04:28.199> and<00:04:40.879> what's

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
it you'll be out with thee and what's

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.649 
it you'll be out with thee and what's
really<00:04:42.270> key<00:04:42.569> is<00:04:43.490> taking<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> photo<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.389> the

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
really key is taking the photo of the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.339 
really key is taking the photo of the
connector<00:04:46.169> so<00:04:46.860> once<00:04:47.069> you<00:04:47.220> have<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.639> new

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
connector so once you have the new

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.020 
connector so once you have the new
wiring<00:04:49.349> in<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.430> compare<00:04:52.520> ok<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.759> very

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
wiring in you can compare ok this very

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.879 
wiring in you can compare ok this very
next<00:04:54.389> step<00:04:54.629> we're<00:04:55.050> going<00:04:55.199> to<00:04:55.259> throw<00:04:55.530> on<00:04:55.710> our

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
next step we're going to throw on our

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.350 
next step we're going to throw on our
shield<00:04:59.330> so<00:05:00.330> we<00:05:00.539> cut<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.199> right<00:05:01.469> size

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
shield so we cut it to the right size

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.959 
shield so we cut it to the right size
have<00:05:03.360> enough<00:05:03.719> room<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:06.110> put<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:08.250> boots

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
have enough room to put on the boots

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.230 
have enough room to put on the boots
shrink<00:05:09.360> later<00:05:09.599> on<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.409> smaller<00:05:11.240> individual

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
shrink later on the smaller individual

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.200 
shrink later on the smaller individual

all these together you don't want to

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.089 
all these together you don't want to
strip<00:05:24.090> away<00:05:24.120> too<00:05:24.330> much<00:05:24.779> what<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.590> want<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.889> do

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
strip away too much what you want to do

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.480 
strip away too much what you want to do
I'd<00:05:26.789> say<00:05:27.210> about<00:05:27.449> half<00:05:28.610> inch<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:30.060> 3/8<00:05:31.020> on<00:05:31.979> both

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
I'd say about half inch to 3/8 on both

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.080 
I'd say about half inch to 3/8 on both
ends<00:05:32.909> so<00:05:34.909> we're<00:05:35.909> going<00:05:36.029> to<00:05:36.090> do<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.300> side<00:05:36.690> and

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
ends so we're going to do this side and

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.430 
ends so we're going to do this side and
that's<00:05:39.090> we're<00:05:39.270> going<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.690> harness<00:05:40.080> from

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
that's we're going to the harness from

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.040 
that's we're going to the harness from
within<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.860> bars<00:05:42.169> see<00:05:43.169> them<00:05:43.380> out<00:05:44.659> so<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.840> next

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
within the bars see them out so the next

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.459 
within the bars see them out so the next
step<00:05:46.349> we<00:05:46.590> want<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.919> go<00:05:47.099> in<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.669> slip<00:05:47.969> our

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
step we want to go in and slip our

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.339 
step we want to go in and slip our
shrink<00:05:49.469> wrap<00:05:49.770> or<00:05:50.129> heat<00:05:50.370> shrink<00:05:51.199> onto<00:05:52.199> these

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
shrink wrap or heat shrink onto these

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:58.189 
shrink wrap or heat shrink onto these
ends<00:05:53.060> now<00:05:54.409> just<00:05:55.409> for<00:05:55.590> simplicity<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:57.300> so

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
ends now just for simplicity and so

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.550 
ends now just for simplicity and so
these<00:05:58.349> don't<00:05:58.590> slide<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.219> fall<00:05:59.460> off<00:05:59.759> I<00:06:00.560> started

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
these don't slide and fall off I started

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.279 
these don't slide and fall off I started
it<00:06:01.650> on<00:06:01.740> one<00:06:02.039> side<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:04.009> do<00:06:05.009> four<00:06:05.279> at<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.460> time

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
it on one side and do four at a time

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.409 
it on one side and do four at a time
so<00:06:07.289> just<00:06:07.620> slip<00:06:07.979> your<00:06:08.219> shrink<00:06:08.789> wrap<00:06:09.060> on<00:06:11.419> you

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
so just slip your shrink wrap on you

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.300 
so just slip your shrink wrap on you
have<00:06:12.629> to<00:06:12.810> twist<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.319> ends<00:06:13.800> braided<00:06:14.550> wire<00:06:16.310> so

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
have to twist the ends braided wire so

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.279 
have to twist the ends braided wire so
those<00:06:17.490> you<00:06:17.669> need<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.969> cut<00:06:18.240> to<00:06:18.479> make<00:06:18.509> sure<00:06:18.900> that

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
those you need to cut to make sure that

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.909 
those you need to cut to make sure that
your<00:06:20.009> shrimp<00:06:20.340> right<00:06:20.639> wrap<00:06:21.560> extends<00:06:22.560> over<00:06:22.740> both

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
your shrimp right wrap extends over both

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.189 
your shrimp right wrap extends over both
sides<00:06:23.250> you're<00:06:23.669> looking<00:06:23.940> at<00:06:24.060> about<00:06:24.150> 3/4<00:06:24.899> of<00:06:24.930> an

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
sides you're looking at about 3/4 of an

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.430 
sides you're looking at about 3/4 of an
inch

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.139 

the<00:06:28.440> next<00:06:28.740> we<00:06:28.860> have<00:06:29.039> yellow<00:06:29.279> now<00:06:29.789> you<00:06:29.849> have<00:06:30.000> to

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
the next we have yellow now you have to

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.690 
the next we have yellow now you have to
be<00:06:30.270> careful

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
be careful

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.940 
be careful
because<00:06:31.090> some<00:06:31.330> of<00:06:31.360> these<00:06:31.600> colors<00:06:32.080> are

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
because some of these colors are

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.640 
because some of these colors are
duplicated<00:06:33.790> but<00:06:34.000> with<00:06:34.240> a<00:06:34.270> stripe<00:06:34.810> so<00:06:35.410> you<00:06:35.470> can

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
duplicated but with a stripe so you can

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.470 
duplicated but with a stripe so you can
see<00:06:35.860> this<00:06:36.130> is<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.340> yellow<00:06:36.670> but<00:06:37.030> this<00:06:37.300> is<00:06:37.450> a

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
see this is a yellow but this is a

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.220 
see this is a yellow but this is a
yellow<00:06:37.930> with<00:06:38.170> a<00:06:38.550> black<00:06:39.550> stripe<00:06:40.080> that's<00:06:41.080> why

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
yellow with a black stripe that's why

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.280 
yellow with a black stripe that's why
the<00:06:41.290> documentation<00:06:42.280> and<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.760> photos<00:06:43.180> is<00:06:44.140> an

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
the documentation and the photos is an

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.370 
the documentation and the photos is an
important<00:06:44.680> process<00:06:44.860> so<00:06:45.400> this<00:06:45.580> is<00:06:45.820> key<00:06:46.290> so<00:06:47.290> when

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
important process so this is key so when

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.520 
important process so this is key so when
you're<00:06:47.530> attaching<00:06:47.830> your<00:06:48.190> two<00:06:48.430> wires<00:06:48.760> together

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
you're attaching your two wires together

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.910 
you're attaching your two wires together
want<00:06:50.530> to<00:06:50.650> meet<00:06:50.860> them<00:06:51.100> halfway<00:06:51.430> up<00:06:52.830> so<00:06:53.830> it

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
want to meet them halfway up so it

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.090 
want to meet them halfway up so it
should<00:06:54.100> look<00:06:54.130> like<00:06:54.340> that<00:06:55.650> make<00:06:56.650> sure<00:06:56.680> you're

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
should look like that make sure you're

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.360 
should look like that make sure you're
right<00:06:57.430> in<00:06:57.760> the<00:06:57.790> center<00:06:58.360> on<00:06:58.510> both<00:06:59.070> before<00:07:00.070> you

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
right in the center on both before you

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.940 
right in the center on both before you
start<00:07:00.670> to<00:07:00.820> twist<00:07:01.150> one<00:07:01.800> side<00:07:02.800> at<00:07:03.310> a<00:07:03.370> time<00:07:04.950> for

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
start to twist one side at a time for

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.220 
start to twist one side at a time for
you<00:07:06.100> begin<00:07:06.400> to<00:07:06.580> solder<00:07:06.880> so<00:07:07.810> now<00:07:07.930> you<00:07:07.990> want<00:07:08.200> to

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
you begin to solder so now you want to

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.580 
you begin to solder so now you want to
grab<00:07:08.350> your<00:07:08.560> soldering<00:07:08.920> iron<00:07:10.230> want<00:07:11.230> to<00:07:11.320> apply

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
grab your soldering iron want to apply

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.000 
grab your soldering iron want to apply
heat<00:07:12.100> to<00:07:12.940> the<00:07:13.240> wire<00:07:13.480> right<00:07:14.700> so<00:07:15.700> what's<00:07:15.940> key<00:07:16.360> is

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.010 
heat to the wire right so what's key is

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.990 
heat to the wire right so what's key is
the<00:07:18.010> wire<00:07:18.450> gets<00:07:19.450> to<00:07:19.870> the<00:07:20.080> right<00:07:20.350> temperature

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.330 

so<00:07:25.000> when<00:07:25.180> you're<00:07:25.330> actually<00:07:25.920> applying<00:07:26.920> your

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
so when you're actually applying your

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.840 
so when you're actually applying your
solder<00:07:29.580> you<00:07:30.580> apply<00:07:30.940> it<00:07:31.000> right<00:07:31.420> to<00:07:31.660> the<00:07:31.810> wire

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.850 
solder you apply it right to the wire

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:39.450 
solder you apply it right to the wire
and<00:07:33.850> you'll<00:07:34.060> notice<00:07:34.510> that<00:07:35.520> it'll<00:07:36.520> flow<00:07:38.460> once

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.460 
and you'll notice that it'll flow once

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.260 
and you'll notice that it'll flow once
you<00:07:39.640> have<00:07:39.850> your<00:07:40.060> heat<00:07:40.360> shrink<00:07:40.720> over<00:07:42.270> your

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270 
you have your heat shrink over your

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.930 
you have your heat shrink over your
wires<00:07:43.540> your<00:07:44.200> connections<00:07:44.860> make<00:07:45.610> sure<00:07:45.880> to

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:45.940 
wires your connections make sure to

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.220 
wires your connections make sure to
describe<00:07:46.270> any<00:07:46.510> lighter<00:07:47.400> where<00:07:48.400> heat<00:07:48.700> shrink

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.230 
describe any lighter where heat shrink

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:55.490 
describe any lighter where heat shrink
and<00:07:50.400> it<00:07:51.400> will<00:07:51.700> shrink<00:07:53.520> make<00:07:54.520> a<00:07:54.550> nice<00:07:54.970> seal

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 
and it will shrink make a nice seal

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.900 
and it will shrink make a nice seal
here's<00:07:56.500> what<00:07:56.710> your<00:07:56.860> wiring<00:07:57.040> looks<00:07:57.370> like<00:07:57.670> when

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910 
here's what your wiring looks like when

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.930 
here's what your wiring looks like when
it's<00:07:58.060> all<00:07:58.210> said<00:07:58.510> and<00:07:58.660> done<00:07:59.580> just<00:08:00.580> a<00:08:00.700> matter<00:08:00.850> of

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:00.940 
it's all said and done just a matter of

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.640 
it's all said and done just a matter of
slipping<00:08:01.180> on<00:08:01.450> your<00:08:01.630> last<00:08:01.900> piece<00:08:02.230> of<00:08:02.440> heat

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.650 
slipping on your last piece of heat

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.650 
slipping on your last piece of heat
shrink<00:08:02.790> just<00:08:03.790> to<00:08:03.970> cover<00:08:04.180> up<00:08:04.330> that<00:08:05.260> connection
