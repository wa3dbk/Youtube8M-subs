00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so as we're getting ready to start

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.090 
so as we're getting ready to start
creating<00:00:09.150> digital<00:00:09.930> negatives<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.860> first

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
creating digital negatives the first

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.730 
creating digital negatives the first
thing<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:11.549> need<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.850> do<00:00:12.270> is<00:00:12.709> inside<00:00:13.709> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
thing that we need to do is inside a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.160 
thing that we need to do is inside a
Photoshop<00:00:14.459> we're<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.480> printing<00:00:15.959> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
Photoshop we're going to be printing a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.300 
Photoshop we're going to be printing a
step<00:00:17.070> test<00:00:17.369> negative<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.800> USB<00:00:20.070> stick

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
step test negative so on my USB stick

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.089 
step test negative so on my USB stick
I've<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> file<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.839> says<00:00:22.109> negative

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
I've got a file here it says negative

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.570 
I've got a file here it says negative
step<00:00:23.820> table<00:00:24.599> gamma<00:00:25.019> 1.8<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.249> I'm<00:00:26.339> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> go

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
step table gamma 1.8 so I'm going to go

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.919 
step table gamma 1.8 so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.999> double<00:00:27.210> click<00:00:27.419> and<00:00:27.599> that'll<00:00:27.810> open

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
ahead and double click and that'll open

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.819 
ahead and double click and that'll open
up<00:00:28.169> inside<00:00:28.499> a<00:00:28.560> Photoshop<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:30.019> then<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.289> couple

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
up inside a Photoshop and then a couple

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.670 
up inside a Photoshop and then a couple
of<00:00:32.009> things<00:00:32.250> we're<00:00:32.669> gonna<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:33.000> looking<00:00:33.180> at

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
of things we're gonna be looking at

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.140 
of things we're gonna be looking at
inside<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> Photoshop<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.820> we're<00:00:35.970> kind<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
inside a Photoshop just as we're kind of

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150 
inside a Photoshop just as we're kind of
getting<00:00:36.270> familiar<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> step<00:00:37.920> test

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
getting familiar is this is a step test

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.710 
getting familiar is this is a step test
and<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.400> has<00:00:38.610> all<00:00:38.820> sorts<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.270> squares<00:00:39.630> that

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
and it has all sorts of squares that

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.930 
and it has all sorts of squares that
have<00:00:40.020> known<00:00:40.320> values<00:00:40.830> now<00:00:41.310> we're<00:00:41.520> looking<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have known values now we're looking at a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.590 
have known values now we're looking at a
negative<00:00:42.240> so<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.740> zero<00:00:44.010> values<00:00:44.490> in<00:00:44.760> our<00:00:45.150> info

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
negative so the zero values in our info

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
negative so the zero values in our info
palette<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.740> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.220> be<00:00:47.430> reading

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
palette over here is going to be reading

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.990 
palette over here is going to be reading
the<00:00:48.240> black<00:00:48.540> value<00:00:49.080> which<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.830> this<00:00:50.130> case<00:00:50.400> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the black value which in this case the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.470 
the black value which in this case the
zero<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.110> reading<00:00:52.320> 100<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.940> 100

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
zero is actually reading 100 and the 100

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
zero is actually reading 100 and the 100
is<00:00:54.600> reading<00:00:54.990> zero<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.400> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
is reading zero and then all of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.860 
is reading zero and then all of the
other<00:00:56.870> values<00:00:58.070> corresponds<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.450> 97<00:01:00.450> is<00:01:00.570> giving

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
other values corresponds so 97 is giving

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.530 
other values corresponds so 97 is giving
us<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.990> value<00:01:01.200> of<00:01:01.500> 3<00:01:01.860> as<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.820> print<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> these

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
us a value of 3 as we print it these

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.359 
us a value of 3 as we print it these
will<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.780> become<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.350> black<00:01:04.530> values<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
will then become the black values and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.950 
will then become the black values and
these<00:01:05.580> darker<00:01:06.030> ones<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.360> become<00:01:06.630> our<00:01:06.780> white

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
these darker ones will become our white

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520 
these darker ones will become our white
values<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.539> could<00:01:09.780> print<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
values now we could print this just the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
values now we could print this just the
way<00:01:10.649> that<00:01:10.859> it<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.609> all<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.570> numbers

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
way that it is but all of our numbers

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
way that it is but all of our numbers
are<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.109> to<00:01:13.170> read<00:01:13.409> backwards<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:14.429> I<00:01:14.670> would

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
are going to read backwards so I would

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
are going to read backwards so I would
suggest<00:01:15.149> as<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:15.749> making<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.079> step<00:01:16.439> test

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
suggest as you're making your step test

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.709 
suggest as you're making your step test
then<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.310> take<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> second<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.509> this

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
then you take a second and take this

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.450 
then you take a second and take this
insane<00:01:19.170> image<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:21.049> rotate<00:01:22.049> canvas<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> flip

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
insane image and rotate canvas and flip

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.169 
insane image and rotate canvas and flip
horizontal<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.789> print<00:01:27.060> this

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
horizontal that way as we print this

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.599 
horizontal that way as we print this
image<00:01:27.390> all<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.049> our<00:01:28.170> numbers<00:01:28.409> will<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
image all of our numbers will be kind of

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.520 
image all of our numbers will be kind of
reversed<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.359> then<00:01:30.929> I'll<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.259> ahead<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.469> just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
reversed and then I'll go ahead and just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.169 
reversed and then I'll go ahead and just
move<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:32.100> over<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> our

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
move this back over to the top of our

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.739 
move this back over to the top of our
document<00:01:34.819> I'm<00:01:35.819> printing<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.359> so<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.630> it'll

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
document I'm printing this so that it'll

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.319 
document I'm printing this so that it'll
be<00:01:36.869> about<00:01:37.200> oh<00:01:37.740> four<00:01:38.249> and<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.429> half<00:01:38.490> inches<00:01:38.969> or<00:01:39.149> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
be about oh four and a half inches or so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.300 
be about oh four and a half inches or so
so<00:01:39.569> it'll<00:01:39.719> fit<00:01:39.899> easily<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.319> our<00:01:40.829> pieces<00:01:41.069> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so it'll fit easily on our pieces of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.489 
so it'll fit easily on our pieces of
paper<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.999> create<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> we

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
paper that we're going to create and we

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.230 
paper that we're going to create and we
can<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.429> single<00:01:44.909> sheet<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> paper

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
can get to on a single sheet of paper

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
can get to on a single sheet of paper
because<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.139> be<00:01:46.229> creating<00:01:46.590> one

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
because we're going to be creating one

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.459 
because we're going to be creating one
now<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.850> after<00:01:48.270> we've<00:01:48.659> generated<00:01:49.139> our

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
now and one after we've generated our

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.940 
now and one after we've generated our
step<00:01:49.740> curve<00:01:50.959> so<00:01:51.959> in<00:01:52.139> order<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.469> print<00:01:52.679> this

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
step curve so in order to print this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.129 
step curve so in order to print this
we're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:53.999> it<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> same<00:01:54.539> method

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
we're going to do it in the same method

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.510 
we're going to do it in the same method
that<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.530> normally<00:01:55.679> print<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.369> when

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that we would normally print so when

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.349 
that we would normally print so when
it's<00:01:56.639> a<00:01:56.789> file<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:58.399> print

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.120 

and<00:02:03.359> because<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.259> horizontal<00:02:04.530> we'll<00:02:04.979> go

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and because it's a horizontal we'll go

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.429 
and because it's a horizontal we'll go
ahead<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.310> change<00:02:05.850> our<00:02:06.030> rotation<00:02:06.929> we're<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
ahead and change our rotation we're not

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.270 
ahead and change our rotation we're not
gonna<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:07.890> sort<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.220> scaling<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:10.349> like

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
gonna do any sort of scaling and like

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
gonna do any sort of scaling and like
all<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.640> our<00:02:11.760> papers<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> be

be using Pro premium glossy photo paper
and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.049> other<00:02:28.170> thing<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.620> need<00:02:28.739> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and then the other thing that we need to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.059 
and then the other thing that we need to
change<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.310> inside<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.819> print<00:02:30.060> settings<00:02:31.069> we're

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
change is inside of print settings we're

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.180 
change is inside of print settings we're
gonna<00:02:32.190> be<00:02:32.510> selecting<00:02:33.510> from<00:02:34.260> where<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.980> says

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
gonna be selecting from where it says

layout printer settings and our media

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.280 
layout printer settings and our media
type<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.989> going<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.739> photo<00:02:41.190> paper<00:02:42.079> premium

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.220 
glossy so we're gonna be premium photo
paper<00:02:49.079> glossy<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.110> be

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
paper glossy and then we are going to be

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.039 
paper glossy and then we are going to be
choosing<00:02:52.620> advanced<00:02:52.950> black-and-white<00:02:53.640> and

choosing advanced black-and-white and
from<00:02:55.049> here<00:02:55.349> instead<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.370> 1400<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.360> going

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
from here instead of the 1400 I'm going

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.089 
from here instead of the 1400 I'm going
to<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.660> selecting<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> 2880<00:02:59.190> and<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:01.920> make

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
to be selecting the 2880 and just make

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.949 
to be selecting the 2880 and just make
sure<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.280> high-speed<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:03.120> unchecked<00:03:03.629> and

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
sure that high-speed is unchecked and

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.890 
sure that high-speed is unchecked and
that<00:03:04.410> finest<00:03:04.860> detail<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.700> checked<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.569> then

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that finest detail is checked and then

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080 
that finest detail is checked and then
to<00:03:06.989> say<00:03:07.139> safe<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:08.310> remember<00:03:08.700> goes<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
to say safe they remember goes to the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.370 
to say safe they remember goes to the
settings<00:03:09.420> from<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> last<00:03:09.870> time<00:03:10.109> that<00:03:10.260> I've

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
settings from the last time that I've

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.220 
settings from the last time that I've
done<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.069> then<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.299> order<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.019> print

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
done this and then in order to print

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.319 
done this and then in order to print
we're<00:03:14.069> going<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.609> be<00:03:14.700> hitting<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> print

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
we're going to just be hitting the print

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.530 
we're going to just be hitting the print
button<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.260> second<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:16.859> so<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:18.329> paper

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
button in just a second and so the paper

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
button in just a second and so the paper
that<00:03:18.720> we're<00:03:18.840> going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.989> be<00:03:19.170> using<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that we're going to be using is a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.349 
that we're going to be using is a
picture<00:03:20.760> Rico<00:03:21.920> OHP<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.239> is

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
picture Rico OHP and this one is

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.199 
picture Rico OHP and this one is
eight-and-a-half<00:03:24.780> by<00:03:25.079> eleven<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.850> comes<00:03:27.060> in

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
eight-and-a-half by eleven it comes in

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.140 
eight-and-a-half by eleven it comes in
all<00:03:27.329> sorts<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.750> sizes<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.739> good

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
all sorts of sizes so it's a really good

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.550 
all sorts of sizes so it's a really good
negative<00:03:30.150> sheet<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.599> kind<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.049> work<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
negative sheet to kind of work with the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.250 
negative sheet to kind of work with the
transparency<00:03:32.250> film<00:03:32.599> they<00:03:33.599> make<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.900> even<00:03:34.139> in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
transparency film they make it even in

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.470 
transparency film they make it even in
roll<00:03:34.500> sizes<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.310> again<00:03:35.880> with<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> digital

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
roll sizes so again with the digital

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.120 
roll sizes so again with the digital
negative<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.139> the<00:03:37.230> great<00:03:37.410> things<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.859> once

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
negative one of the great things is once

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.839 
negative one of the great things is once
we<00:03:38.340> kind<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.609> get<00:03:38.760> familiar<00:03:39.150> with<00:03:39.269> using<00:03:39.810> these

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
we kind of get familiar with using these

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.360 
we kind of get familiar with using these
the<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.209> curve<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.079> create<00:03:43.470> can<00:03:43.980> then<00:03:44.250> be

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the the curve that we create can then be

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.069 
the the curve that we create can then be
scaled<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.239> could<00:03:45.419> make<00:03:45.630> any<00:03:45.840> size

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
scaled up so you could make any size

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.319 
scaled up so you could make any size
prints<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.769> wanted<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.880> only<00:03:48.090> trick

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
prints that you wanted the only trick

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.360 
prints that you wanted the only trick
with<00:03:48.569> using<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.079> transparency<00:03:49.799> paper<00:03:49.980> is

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
with using the transparency paper is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.390 
with using the transparency paper is
just<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.419> when<00:03:51.780> you're<00:03:51.959> printing<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.680> four<00:03:53.250> by

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
just like when you're printing a four by

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.900 
just like when you're printing a four by
five<00:03:53.579> negative<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:56.130> need<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.400> make<00:03:56.549> sure<00:03:56.760> that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
five negative we need to make sure that

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.569 
five negative we need to make sure that
we<00:03:57.030> load<00:03:57.569> this<00:03:57.840> into<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.470> printer<00:03:58.889> so<00:03:59.549> that

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
we load this into the printer so that

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.770 
we load this into the printer so that
it's<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> emulsion<00:04:00.510> side<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.220> film

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
it's on the emulsion side so on the film

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.740 
it's on the emulsion side so on the film
in<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.349> top<00:04:04.590> right<00:04:04.859> hand<00:04:05.069> corner<00:04:05.750> there's

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
in the top right hand corner there's

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.720 
in the top right hand corner there's
going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.989> be<00:04:07.109> a<00:04:07.230> notch<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:08.069> if<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.400> look<00:04:08.579> on

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
going to be a notch so if we look on
