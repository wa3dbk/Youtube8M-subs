there is the cedar worm bin so we've got

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.830 
there is the cedar worm bin so we've got
the<00:00:35.610> top<00:00:35.850> tray<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> half<00:00:38.219> full<00:00:38.840> bottom

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
there so we have to have them go down

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.520 
there so we have to have them go down
into<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.530> top<00:01:56.800> tray<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.930> order<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.200> do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
into this top tray so in order to do

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.230 
into this top tray so in order to do
that<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.830> want<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.220> make<00:02:00.369> sure<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:03.240> we're

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
that I want to make sure that we're

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.660 
that I want to make sure that we're
going<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.390> use<00:02:04.630> light<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.619> they're<00:02:06.430> just

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
going to use light and they're just

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.609 
going to use light and they're just
going<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.850> go<00:02:07.060> migrate<00:02:07.780> downward<00:02:08.229> since<00:02:08.440> they

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
going to go migrate downward since they

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.499 
going to go migrate downward since they
don't<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.130> light<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:10.239> what<00:02:10.390> we're

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
don't like the light and what we're

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.750 
don't like the light and what we're
going<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.660> do<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.080> make<00:02:11.320> sure<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.760> this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
going to do is make sure that this

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.190 
going to do is make sure that this
material<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.690> here

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
material in here

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
material in here
is<00:02:14.950> built<00:02:15.400> up<00:02:15.640> enough<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.350> actually

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is built up enough for them to actually

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.650 
is built up enough for them to actually
go<00:02:19.330> down<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.549> tray<00:02:21.880> because<00:02:22.360> if<00:02:22.510> they

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
go down to this tray because if they

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.600 
go down to this tray because if they
couldn't<00:02:23.019> touch<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:24.040> couldn't<00:02:24.370> get<00:02:24.580> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
couldn't touch it they couldn't get to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:38.410 
couldn't touch it they couldn't get to
it<00:02:25.799> so<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:29.200> build<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.739> up

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470 

so<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.569> put<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.900> top<00:02:40.349> one<00:02:40.560> up<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:41.480> they

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so when I put that top one up there they

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.180 
so when I put that top one up there they
have<00:02:42.720> somewhere<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> go<00:02:43.319> kind<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.099> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
have somewhere to go kind of like a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:03:04.089 
have somewhere to go kind of like a
ladder<00:02:53.329> all<00:02:54.329> right<00:02:59.690> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.810> look<00:03:01.079> underneath

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.610 

they're<00:03:05.099> gonna<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.459> underneath<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.239> mesh

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
they're gonna go underneath that mesh

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.640 
they're gonna go underneath that mesh
and<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:08.220> go<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.810> material<00:03:10.410> right

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and then go on to that material right

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.720 
and then go on to that material right
there<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:13.049> as<00:03:13.260> they're<00:03:13.560> moving<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:13.920> I'm

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
there and as they're moving down I'm

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.150 
there and as they're moving down I'm
just<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.629> scrape<00:03:16.049> some<00:03:16.379> of<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.680> off

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
just going to scrape some of this off

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.440 
just going to scrape some of this off
the<00:03:17.459> top<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:19.190> harvest<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:21.120> make<00:03:21.269> sure

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the top and harvest this and make sure

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.479 
the top and harvest this and make sure
there's<00:03:21.629> no<00:03:21.690> worms<00:03:22.049> in<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.409> and<00:03:22.890> then

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
there's no worms in it and then

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.869 
there's no worms in it and then
eventually<00:03:23.819> they<00:03:24.480> will<00:03:24.599> all<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.370> head<00:03:26.370> right

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
eventually they will all just head right

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.440 
eventually they will all just head right
down<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.019> second<00:03:28.500> tray<00:03:29.000> which<00:03:30.000> will<00:03:30.269> be

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
down to that second tray which will be

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:41.690 
down to that second tray which will be
the<00:03:30.569> top<00:03:30.780> tray<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> basically<00:03:41.010> using<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the top tray so basically using the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.520 
the top tray so basically using the
light<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.889> worms<00:03:44.099> do<00:03:44.489> not<00:03:44.730> like<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
light because the worms do not like it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.860 
light because the worms do not like it
and<00:03:46.530> they<00:03:47.040> are<00:03:47.190> gonna<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.549> down<00:03:47.819> just<00:03:48.150> harvest

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
and they are gonna go down just harvest

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.940 
and they are gonna go down just harvest
a<00:03:49.049> little<00:03:53.810> make<00:03:54.810> sure<00:03:55.049> there's<00:03:55.290> no<00:03:55.410> worms<00:03:55.680> in

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
a little make sure there's no worms in

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:57.210 
a little make sure there's no worms in
there<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.959> then<00:04:04.169> just<00:04:04.440> keep<00:04:04.650> scraping<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.430> off

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.120 

so<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.430> takes<00:04:58.730> a<00:04:58.910> lot<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.210> time<00:04:59.500> not<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.680> lot<00:05:00.950> of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
so this takes a lot of time not a lot of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.370 
so this takes a lot of time not a lot of
time<00:05:01.280> but<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.850> know<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.180> know<00:05:02.420> an<00:05:02.660> afternoon

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
time but you know I know an afternoon

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.620 
time but you know I know an afternoon
and<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.190> can<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.520> go<00:05:04.640> do<00:05:04.850> other<00:05:05.000> things<00:05:05.390> and

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
and you can just go do other things and

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:36.230 
and you can just go do other things and
come<00:05:05.810> back<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:07.360> scrape<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:09.730> check

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.940 

okay<00:05:37.240> this<00:05:37.480> process<00:05:38.050> is<00:05:38.290> working<00:05:38.470> quite

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
okay this process is working quite

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.190 
okay this process is working quite
nicely<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:41.050> does<00:05:41.260> take<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.590> while<00:05:42.840> it's<00:05:43.840> not<00:05:43.990> for

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
nicely it does take a while it's not for

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.280
