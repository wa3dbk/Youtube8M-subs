00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.770
 there for four in the miner 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.140
 mitsubishi motorsports put this 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.529
 people who love to lift dust in 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.779
 uberlÃ¢ndia tracks the steps is dry 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.660
 because of the weather and everything has a lot 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.320
 earth beat loose gravel 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.080
 we spend several times over 10 and we are 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.739
 slow speed and jumping place 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.430
 both with dry floor 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.460
 the creeks gives a fun bath 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.680
 by the size of the challenge of the bonds are 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.969
 where the duo are forced to pass 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.059
 more than once 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.460
 and in and around can get lost and 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.170
 had henry l behind a car that is 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.539
 Wrong went ahead we went 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.340
 follow them when they saw was wrong 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.910
 had two equal references or one 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.649
 tabu and a tab was at the end of a 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.289
 at the beginning of the other she spoke of a taboo 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.570
 also at the beginning of the other sheet I 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.220
 had to stop and I just looked at the end 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.690
 She does not see that race on the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.210
 next they go straight 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.060
 the regularity rally the total attention 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.970
 on the worksheet and the electronic version 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.800
 has helped the owner's team 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.850
 of that team's car saying where it is 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.370
 marking 5 km of 190 meters please 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.050
 Real will have five large long this 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.600
 Unlike the difference points to rise in 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.300
 podium at mitsubishi motorsports is the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.540
 dream of many in love with rally 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.130
 who arrives there is only joy where they did 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.080
 a proof if perfect 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 The proof was very cool, demanding in the 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.640
 navigation and piloting and we were 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.080
 well there is the result of the work of 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.420
 some years partnership but beyond the victory 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.920
 What counts here only the good stories 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.700
 to count 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.210
 was there in 2004 at the time we walked 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 with our two children here today each 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.080

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.670
 your goal your challenge we are already 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.080
 has been together for 78 years and is a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.850
 forever because we already have 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.020
 tuning is a wedding on the rally but 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.020
 technical sum 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.480
