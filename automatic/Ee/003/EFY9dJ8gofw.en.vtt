00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.630
 how about guardians I bring this 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.000
 section on the moon that does not finish me 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.440
 teach me how to get here and it's something that 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.840
 I will share with you in the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.840
 next video as soon as I finish 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.249
 at doors when we put everything to 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.920
 end of the mission of the camera of the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.469
 native 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.390
 really migrants the coast is not going to 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.220
 open follows my modest 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.130
 so let's go from the opposite side we're going to 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.490
 find very interesting things 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.950
 now it is assumed that this part of the 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.320
 next evolution in the tlc of the 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.850
 darkness is to the human patient I do not 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 I am very convinced that that is 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.460
 true this is what people say 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.290
 rumors because I say good in these 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.460
 options two dead aspects and 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 multifunction 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.960
 we already took it but I'm going to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.600
 show a previous recording when 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.180
 take what you can personally see them 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.710
 I recommend that they be grabbed because 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.360
 there were comments one of these 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 specters but from some other 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.920
 hello I took them four days and has not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 past nothing so they want to grab it is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 what your own risk 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 ok continent let's explore this area 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.690
 so that they know her it looks like 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.440
 any other part of the moon 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.010
 and I want you to see this this symbol that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.010
 is behind 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.030
 the symbol 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.440
 apparently it is a hive the symbol of 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.009
 the hype 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.700
 time 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.700
 We do this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.599
 the problem goes everywhere in the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.019
 elections and you can see a banner and 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.019
 above 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.910
 another interesting thing I want you to check 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.260
 these as giant containers like 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.060
 col - giant are there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.000
 I'm not sure it's whole 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.280
 up there is one of them 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.750
 next respect 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.750
 exactly hey 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.590
 to get there to rivers in ours 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.590
 we leave the door 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.519
 and then from here the return and jump 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.440
 and as I mentioned before I already took it but 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.530
 You can see it in the photograph this 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.520
 spectrum gives them a memory that says 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.520
 wordpress 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.639
 Well, if you want to grab this 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.150
 respect dead and we continue with 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.319
 our turn 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.939
 these doors 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.340
 because they are connected to the same place 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.640
 which is the main hall 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.370
 and here we can see 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.270
 another hive of these customers in the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.120
 containers 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.660
 and the next section from which everything 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.660
 the world speaks 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.890
 and the next d lc 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.210
 I'm going to put the photograph of the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.720
 central region to see what it is 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.730
 exactly the same 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.230
 how can you see there 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.209
 do not even know how to get to this 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.989
 part of a pose less to see the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.549
 comments 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.379
 it's not hard to sew them 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.940
 minutes of this and unfortunately 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.799
 until we arrived we could not go anymore 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.150
 there subscribe for more contents of 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.150
 this mini and we stayed in the tower
