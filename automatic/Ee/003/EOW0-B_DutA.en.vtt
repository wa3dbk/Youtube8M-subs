00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.450 
took the paper pattern in and made it
smaller<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.620> doesn't<00:02:11.890> look<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.130> much<00:02:12.280> like

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
smaller so it doesn't look so much like

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.060
