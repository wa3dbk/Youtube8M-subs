 I want to go 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:27.040
 incredible where I went to the area 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 spoons 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.160
 6 and I have nowhere to go with the text 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:47.470

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.590
 too realistic micro and I her and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.340
 I already have brains melted like a bucket 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.540
 apparently the outskirts of it all did what I 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.050
 someone above feet of battery what is it 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 these green come down 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 I can have it higher than the point of the game in 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.930
 what could be here to get 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.930
 what's the point 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.340
 black yes this is the end of the timer along the way behind 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.340
 he cannot go out 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.390
 damn it's just incredible damn me and what 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:41.160
 the game is not so big really 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:46.830
 but then there is nothing else like the end 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.950
 world but note this is what I see here is 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.650
 very, very well, I think big 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:02.010
 the square doesn't believe in currado circles 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:07.410
 I go to nickname so it is what it is 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.040
 it was amazing just yang at 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.700
 how hard is it to perceive this game that 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.150
 I don't even know what to say where you are 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.150
 has come 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.240
 gray mass bring gray mass 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.860
 taken sour where to go that together 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.860
 do this where did I come from 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.570
 straight this music changes know this 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.670
 can the center of this whole thing or 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:50.650
 lawlessness is better to say so here 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.650
 there may be something here now 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:07.430
 oh my way takes away what to do 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:12.310
 but what is yours without knowing where to me these 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.410

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.680

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.680

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.590
 made to the contemplation of opportunity and 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.840

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.440

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.880
 randomly does not slazit back and forth well ka 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.280
