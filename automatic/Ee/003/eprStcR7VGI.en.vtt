00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
little free-for-all so originally this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.269 
little free-for-all so originally this
game<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.420> supposed<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> preparing

game was supposed to be on the preparing
for<00:00:20.520> modern<00:00:21.060> warfare<00:00:21.180> 3<00:00:21.890> segments<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.949> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
for modern warfare 3 segments that I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.340 
for modern warfare 3 segments that I
usually<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.300> instead<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.990> wanted<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
usually do but instead I wanted to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.230 
usually do but instead I wanted to
compare<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:27.420> scar-h<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.830> mar<00:00:29.760> 0<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
compare the scar-h from mar 0 for two to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.139 
compare the scar-h from mar 0 for two to
the<00:00:30.449> scar<00:00:30.960> l<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:32.210> using<00:00:33.210> from<00:00:33.690> mono<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:34.260> 30

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
the scar l from using from mono over 30

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.670 
the scar l from using from mono over 30
so<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.660> couple<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> seconds<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.380> you're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so in a couple of seconds here you're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.000 
so in a couple of seconds here you're
going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.300> on<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.899> top<00:00:40.230> left<00:00:40.620> hand<00:00:40.770> corner

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going to see on the top left hand corner

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.150 
going to see on the top left hand corner
where<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> mini-map<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.950> see

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
where the mini-map is you can see

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
where the mini-map is you can see
gameplay<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> 1<00:00:46.020> over<00:00:46.230> 3<00:00:48.289> convention<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
gameplay from the 1 over 3 convention a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
gameplay from the 1 over 3 convention a
couple<00:00:49.739> months<00:00:49.829> ago<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.000> scar-l

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
couple months ago and it's scar-l

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
couple months ago and it's scar-l
gameplay<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.680> you're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.160> able<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
gameplay so you're going to be able to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.810 
gameplay so you're going to be able to
check<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:55.260> checking<00:00:55.530> out

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
check that out as you're checking out

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.380 
check that out as you're checking out
this<00:00:56.820> scar<00:00:57.149> h<00:00:57.270> gameplay<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.930> compare<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
this scar h gameplay and compare it I

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
this scar h gameplay and compare it I
really<00:01:00.390> thought<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> great<00:01:01.440> way

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
really thought that this is a great way

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.520 
really thought that this is a great way
to<00:01:02.100> compare<00:01:02.579> both<00:01:03.030> gameplays<00:01:03.480> should<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.409> up

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to compare both gameplays should be up

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
to compare both gameplays should be up
right<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:08.610> map

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
right now so there you see a map

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
right now so there you see a map
actually<00:01:09.780> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> looks<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.470> scrappier

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
actually kind of looks like scrappier

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.780 
actually kind of looks like scrappier
that<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:12.000> Mara<00:01:12.630> part<00:01:12.990> 3<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.610> yeah<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that on Mara part 3 but yeah that's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.810 
that on Mara part 3 but yeah that's
absurd<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> point<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.369> gameplay<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
absurd the point it's not my gameplay of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.460 
absurd the point it's not my gameplay of
course<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.360> did<00:01:18.509> not<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:20.040> convention

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
course I did not go to the convention

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.830 
course I did not go to the convention
however<00:01:22.470> i<00:01:22.979> am<00:01:23.430> showing<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
however i am showing it to you just to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
however i am showing it to you just to
so<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> guys<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> comparison<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so you guys can see the comparison so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.039 
so you guys can see the comparison so
the<00:01:27.570> reload<00:01:28.070> with<00:01:29.070> slight<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> hand<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
the reload with slight of hand is

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.149 
the reload with slight of hand is
virtually<00:01:31.049> identical<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.770> pretty<00:01:32.009> sure<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
virtually identical and pretty sure it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.240 
virtually identical and pretty sure it
is<00:01:32.930> however<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> aim<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.409> sights<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:35.040> find

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
is however the aim down sights i find

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
is however the aim down sights i find
that<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.520> model<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.119> three<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.829> aim<00:01:37.920> down

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that on model for three the aim down

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.480 
that on model for three the aim down
sights<00:01:38.430> takes<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:39.090> room<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
sights takes more room you see like the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.630 
sights takes more room you see like the
sides<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.659> pretty<00:01:42.869> much<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.229> entire

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
sides take out pretty much the entire

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.570 
sides take out pretty much the entire
screen<00:01:44.640> wearing<00:01:46.790> when<00:01:47.790> among

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
screen wearing when among

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.340 
screen wearing when among
or<00:01:48.700> two<00:01:48.910> it<00:01:49.240> takes<00:01:49.450> about<00:01:49.570> half<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.230> don't

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
or two it takes about half of it I don't

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.900 
or two it takes about half of it I don't
know<00:01:50.410> if<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.620> guys<00:01:50.740> understand<00:01:51.580> what<00:01:51.670> i<00:01:51.730> mean

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
know if you guys understand what i mean

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.520 
know if you guys understand what i mean
but<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.420> right<00:01:52.870> now<00:01:53.020> i'm<00:01:53.140> aiming<00:01:53.410> down<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
but like right now i'm aiming down the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.370 
but like right now i'm aiming down the
sights<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.190> could<00:01:54.340> see<00:01:54.520> my<00:01:54.670> sides<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.380> model

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
sights and I could see my sides on model

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 
sights and I could see my sides on model
for<00:01:56.530> three<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.860> can't<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.730> I<00:01:57.760> don't<00:01:58.030> know<00:01:58.120> if

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
for three I can't really I don't know if

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.060 
for three I can't really I don't know if
edges<00:01:58.630> because<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.290> screen<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.890> they<00:02:00.010> were

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
edges because the screen that they were

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.940 
edges because the screen that they were
playing<00:02:00.340> on<00:02:00.520> or<00:02:00.760> or<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:02.200> think<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> kick

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
playing on or or what I think the kick

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.700 
playing on or or what I think the kick
is<00:02:03.220> what<00:02:04.000> makes<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.390> makes<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:05.500> different

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
is what makes it makes it so different

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.460 
is what makes it makes it so different
but<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.400> know<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.670> don't<00:02:06.730> know<00:02:07.080> it's<00:02:08.080> yet<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.350> be

to use these scar-l you know scar-h was

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.820 
to use these scar-l you know scar-h was
just<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.940> greatest<00:02:19.390> guns<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
just the one of the greatest guns that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.780 
just the one of the greatest guns that
you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:22.590> modern<00:02:23.590> warfare<00:02:23.710> 2<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.370> it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
you can get in modern warfare 2 and it

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.460 
you can get in modern warfare 2 and it
was<00:02:24.880> early<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.600> got<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.260> that's

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
was early on that you got it so that's

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.640 
was early on that you got it so that's
why<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> lot<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:27.100> people<00:02:27.190> used<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.650> however

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
why a lot of people used it and however

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.949 
why a lot of people used it and however
the<00:02:30.040> only<00:02:30.070> thing<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.550> did<00:02:31.480> not<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:31.930> about

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the only thing that I did not like about

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.860 
the only thing that I did not like about
it<00:02:32.260> was<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.880> magazine<00:02:34.330> size<00:02:35.070> 20<00:02:36.120> bullets<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.600> a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it was the magazine size 20 bullets in a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.350 
it was the magazine size 20 bullets in a
magazine<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:39.130> enough<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:40.240> me

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
magazine that is not enough for me

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.820 
magazine that is not enough for me
personally<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:42.520> should<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.350> normal

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
personally it should be like a normal

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
personally it should be like a normal
assault<00:02:45.340> rifle<00:02:45.640> gun<00:02:45.790> 3<00:02:46.270> 30<00:02:47.080> bullets<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
assault rifle gun 3 30 bullets so in the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.080 
assault rifle gun 3 30 bullets so in the
whole<00:02:49.600> thing<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:49.959> only<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.290> 60<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.090> that's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
whole thing you only have 60 and that's

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.509 
whole thing you only have 60 and that's
why<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.300> was<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:52.630> hmm<00:02:53.200> i'm<00:02:53.769> not<00:02:54.010> i'm<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.220> too

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
why I was like hmm i'm not i'm not too

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.640 
why I was like hmm i'm not i'm not too
sure<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:54.820> not<00:02:55.810> too<00:02:55.930> sure<00:02:56.080> about<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.410> gun

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
sure about not too sure about this gun

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.670 
sure about not too sure about this gun
and<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.070> why<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.220> later<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.840> took<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.989> scar

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and that's why I later on took the scar

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.570 
and that's why I later on took the scar
instead<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.050> urn<00:03:02.050> letarte<00:03:03.010> instead<00:03:03.489> of

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
instead of the urn letarte instead of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.620 
instead of the urn letarte instead of
the<00:03:03.670> scar<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:05.200> yeah<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.760> gameplay<00:03:07.150> is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
the scar but yeah as this gameplay is

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.670 
the scar but yeah as this gameplay is
coming<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.590> an<00:03:08.739> end<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:09.160> about<00:03:09.400> one<00:03:09.880> minute<00:03:10.680> as

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
coming to an end in about one minute as

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.070
