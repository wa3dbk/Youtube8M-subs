00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
temperatures just under 170 should we

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.830 
temperatures just under 170 should we
will<00:00:46.720> see<00:00:46.989> that

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840

here's a bunch of Columbus pellets ounce

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.370 
here's a bunch of Columbus pellets ounce
and<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> quarter<00:02:18.880> I'm<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:19.989> going<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.290> ahead

and a quarter I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:31.110 
and a quarter I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:20.590> add<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.069> right<00:02:21.280> now

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.430 

all<00:02:31.629> right<00:02:32.459> works<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> kettle<00:02:34.209> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
all right works in the kettle and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.220 
all right works in the kettle and
starting<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.500> heat<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.959> should<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.050> down<00:02:38.200> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
starting to heat up so should be down a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:04:04.490 
starting to heat up so should be down a
little<00:02:38.319> while

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.050 

all<00:04:04.920> right<00:04:05.130> we<00:04:05.250> got<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> lot<00:04:05.580> of

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
all right we got a lot of

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.699 
all right we got a lot of
hot<00:04:07.720> break<00:04:08.020> forming<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:08.980> top<00:04:09.010> here

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:05:04.960 

and<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.519> starting<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.819> see<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:14.969> lot<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.150> ripples

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.809 

looks<00:05:05.360> like<00:05:05.540> we're<00:05:05.720> boiling

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.490 

we're<00:05:12.270> at<00:05:12.389> a<00:05:12.419> rolling<00:05:12.719> boil<00:05:13.080> right<00:05:13.379> now<00:05:13.559> and

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.870 

I<00:05:16.590> put<00:05:17.070> in<00:05:17.190> my<00:05:17.870> work<00:05:18.870> Schiller

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.170 

originally<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:22.910> had<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:24.130> whole<00:05:25.130> hop<00:05:25.460> schedule

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
originally I had a whole hop schedule

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.230 
originally I had a whole hop schedule
planned<00:05:26.960> out<00:05:27.170> but<00:05:27.880> little<00:05:28.880> worried<00:05:29.090> about

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
planned out but little worried about

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.650 
planned out but little worried about
running<00:05:29.570> out<00:05:29.630> of

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
running out of

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.540 
running out of
propane<00:05:31.380> and<00:05:31.620> I<00:05:31.680> don't<00:05:31.740> have<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.040> spare<00:05:32.340> tank

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
propane and I don't have a spare tank

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.110 
propane and I don't have a spare tank
right<00:05:32.820> now<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.860> figure<00:05:34.860> out<00:05:35.070> what<00:05:35.850> I'll<00:05:35.970> do

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
right now so I figure out what I'll do

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.620 
right now so I figure out what I'll do
is<00:05:36.300> instead<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.810> um<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.470> nine<00:05:38.310> year<00:05:38.670> 60<00:05:39.330> or<00:05:39.510> 90

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
is instead of um a nine year 60 or 90

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.080 
is instead of um a nine year 60 or 90
minute<00:05:40.080> boil<00:05:40.260> I'm<00:05:41.040> just<00:05:41.190> gonna<00:05:41.340> do<00:05:41.460> about<00:05:41.550> 15

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
minute boil I'm just gonna do about 15

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.610 
minute boil I'm just gonna do about 15
minute<00:05:42.330> boil<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.620> do<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.770> hop<00:05:44.010> first<00:05:45.290> so<00:05:46.290> we'll

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
minute boil and do a hop first so we'll

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.390 
minute boil and do a hop first so we'll
see<00:05:46.770> how<00:05:46.860> that<00:05:46.920> goes<00:05:47.720> usually<00:05:49.220> it's<00:05:50.220> gonna

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
see how that goes usually it's gonna

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.180 
see how that goes usually it's gonna
Cascade<00:05:50.880> hops<00:05:51.530> there's<00:05:52.530> also<00:05:52.740> some<00:05:53.160> more

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
Cascade hops there's also some more

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:34.670 
Cascade hops there's also some more
Columbus<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.060> here

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.879 

flame<00:06:35.680> is<00:06:35.710> off<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:37.470> waters<00:06:38.470> running<00:06:38.710> through

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
flame is off and waters running through
