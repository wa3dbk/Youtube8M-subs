00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
around the country all right one of the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
around the country all right one of the
least<00:01:11.700> funded<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> yet<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.290> another

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
least funded and yet you do have another

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
least funded and yet you do have another
another<00:01:13.979> side<00:01:14.280> another<00:01:14.520> party<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.540> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
literally trying to defund that even

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.570 
literally trying to defund that even
more<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.540> that's<00:01:18.780> something<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:20.369> can't

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
more and that's something that we can't

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
more and that's something that we can't
let<00:01:20.670> happen<00:01:20.970> because<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.110> arts<00:01:22.439> community<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.539 
let happen because the arts community is
a<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.580> vital<00:01:23.960> vital<00:01:24.960> entity<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:26.070> us<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a really vital vital entity for us it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.450 
a really vital vital entity for us it
gives<00:01:26.790> artists<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.570> chance<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> express

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
gives artists a chance to express

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
gives artists a chance to express
themselves<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:30.900> creative<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.590> what

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
themselves to be very creative or what

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
themselves to be very creative or what
they<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.250> cut<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> funding<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
they do and cut that kind of funding you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.450 
they do and cut that kind of funding you
know<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> party<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.369> group

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
know when you have a party or group

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.770 
know when you have a party or group
that's<00:01:35.729> trying<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.060> cut<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> fund<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's trying to cut that fund and you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140 
that's trying to cut that fund and you
literally<00:01:37.049> choke<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> resources

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
literally choke off one of the resources

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.899 
literally choke off one of the resources
that<00:01:39.270> artisan<00:01:40.140> groups<00:01:40.380> tend<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> use<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.670> order

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that artisan groups tend to use in order

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
that artisan groups tend to use in order
to<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.630> order<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> continue<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:43.890> do

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to in order to continue what they do

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.969 
to in order to continue what they do
best<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.960> Obama<00:01:46.049> administration

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
best so I think the Obama administration

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.040 
best so I think the Obama administration
what's<00:01:47.280> good<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.700> him<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> he's<00:01:48.509> not

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
what's good with him is that he's not

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.440 
what's good with him is that he's not
it<00:01:50.830> becomes<00:01:51.400> in<00:01:51.670> one<00:01:51.850> sense<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.270> little

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
it becomes in one sense it's a little

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.040 
it becomes in one sense it's a little
