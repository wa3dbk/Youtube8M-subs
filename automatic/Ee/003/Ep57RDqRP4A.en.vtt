00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
calculator site but I found that the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
calculator site but I found that the
armadillo<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> zodiac<00:01:16.350> Libra<00:01:16.680> even

though they were saying it was the Moose
you<00:01:18.000> should<00:01:18.150> probably<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.140> zodiac<00:01:19.470> Libra

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770

terror well give you four choices the
magnedragon<00:01:33.060> come<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> end<00:01:33.689> dragon<00:01:33.930> with

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
magnedragon come in the end dragon with

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
magnedragon come in the end dragon with
star<00:01:34.170> drag<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> sky<00:01:34.799> dragon<00:01:34.979> even<00:01:35.340> know

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
star drag of the sky dragon even know

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980 
star drag of the sky dragon even know
that<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.700> three<00:01:35.880> possibilities<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.630> exactly

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that but three possibilities are exactly

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.280 
that but three possibilities are exactly
the<00:01:37.140> same<00:01:37.400> guess<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.990> less

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the same guess what it's like way less

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.810 
the same guess what it's like way less
than<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> outcomes<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> others

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
than all the outcomes for the others

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
than all the outcomes for the others
unless<00:01:42.329> there's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.630> combination<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.229> don't

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
unless there's a combination we don't

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
unless there's a combination we don't
know<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.670> trying<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
know about so I'm going to be trying the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
know about so I'm going to be trying the
battery<00:01:45.659> dragon<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> Terra<00:01:46.950> dragon

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
battery dragon with the Terra dragon

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.310 
battery dragon with the Terra dragon
let's<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.180> happens<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.869> type<00:01:49.079> in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
let's see what happens if you type in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
let's see what happens if you type in
the<00:01:49.619> double<00:01:49.950> terror<00:01:50.130> dragon<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> any

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the double terror dragon if it's any

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.220 
the double terror dragon if it's any
different

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
different

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.840 
different
okay<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.220> double<00:01:53.550> terrors

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
okay so I know that the double terrors

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.210 
okay so I know that the double terrors
have<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.300> potency<00:01:54.830> see<00:01:55.830> if<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.130> are

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
have more of a potency see if there are

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.120 
have more of a potency see if there are
more<00:01:56.310> outcomes<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.650> there's<00:01:58.650> actually<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
more outcomes and there's actually a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.010 
more outcomes and there's actually a
lesser<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.510> treasure<00:02:00.630> dragon

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
lesser to we can get the treasure dragon

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.060 
lesser to we can get the treasure dragon
too<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.470> least<00:02:01.680> her<00:02:01.800> there's<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
too but there's a least her there's a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.830 
too but there's a least her there's a
lesser<00:02:02.250> chance<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.700> getting<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.660> let's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
lesser chance of getting that so let's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
lesser chance of getting that so let's
stick<00:02:04.080> back<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.680> let's<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.160> about<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.490> pure

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
stick back to let's see about the pure

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.950 
stick back to let's see about the pure
terror<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.120> happens<00:02:06.390> mmm<00:02:08.540> come<00:02:09.540> on<00:02:09.690> come<00:02:09.930> on

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
terror what happens mmm come on come on

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.790 
terror what happens mmm come on come on
oh<00:02:10.850> those<00:02:11.850> are<00:02:12.000> even<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.270> outcomes<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.740> if

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
oh those are even more outcomes so if

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.260 
oh those are even more outcomes so if
you<00:02:13.860> want<00:02:14.010> least<00:02:14.220> amount<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.520> outcomes<00:02:14.970> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
you want least amount of outcomes you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.530 
you want least amount of outcomes you
should<00:02:15.480> choose<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.050> Terra<00:02:16.860> dragon<00:02:17.760> with<00:02:18.210> the
