quality<00:01:40.500> skin<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.909> let's<00:01:42.420> peel<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
quality skin so let's peel it off and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.980 
quality skin so let's peel it off and
see<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.790> made<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.509> 3m

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
see how we go this is made in with 3m

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
see how we go this is made in with 3m
material<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> should<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
material so it should be pretty good and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.280 
material so it should be pretty good and
actually<00:01:47.970> peeled<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> off<00:01:48.630> before<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.170> why

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually peeled it off before that's why

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
actually peeled it off before that's why
it<00:01:49.350> came<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> easily<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.520> um<00:01:50.640> yeah<00:01:51.180> it's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
it came off so easily but um yeah it's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
it came off so easily but um yeah it's
really<00:01:52.259> cool<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.340> they<00:01:53.610> might<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.939> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
really cool you can see they might be in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.340 
really cool you can see they might be in
there's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> mat<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.110> sure<00:01:55.259> if

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

quite<00:01:57.390> durable<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> nice<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.640> gonna

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
quite durable and nice so I'm just gonna

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
quite durable and nice so I'm just gonna
try<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> line<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:02.210> now<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
try to line this up now I can see it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
try to line this up now I can see it
won't<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.920> cover<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> whole<00:02:05.909> MacBook<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
won't actually cover the whole MacBook I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.779 
won't actually cover the whole MacBook I
don't<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.190> I'm<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> line<00:02:08.759> up

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
don't think so I'm just going to line up

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.530 
don't think so I'm just going to line up
the<00:02:09.000> edges<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.450> best<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.530> even

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the edges as best I can so it's even

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.580 
the edges as best I can so it's even
this<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.690> not<00:02:12.720> true

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
this is not true

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.030 
this is not true
hard<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:14.280> pretty<00:02:14.430> good<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:16.769> basically

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
hard but it's pretty good it's basically

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.759 
hard but it's pretty good it's basically
just<00:02:17.129> line<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.670> coins<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> want<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
just line up all the coins you want and

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.350 
just line up all the coins you want and
then<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.800> think<00:02:20.099> I'm<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.280> gonna<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.700> drop<00:02:21.330> it

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
then I think I'm just gonna like drop it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.670 
then I think I'm just gonna like drop it
down<00:02:21.690> drop<00:02:22.879> it<00:02:23.879> down<00:02:24.090> drop<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> down<00:02:25.019> come<00:02:25.500> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
down drop it down drop it down come on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.140 
down drop it down drop it down come on
let's<00:02:26.129> do<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.620> go<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:29.489> right<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.090> that's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
let's do this go all right so that's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.240 
let's do this go all right so that's
pretty<00:02:30.269> good<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.830> corners<00:02:32.160> are

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
pretty good and all the corners are

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.339 
pretty good and all the corners are
pretty<00:02:32.459> even<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:32.940> go<00:02:33.150> smooth<00:02:33.390> out<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.959> I

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
pretty even so just go smooth out and I

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.140 
pretty even so just go smooth out and I
think<00:02:34.650> we're<00:02:34.980> good<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
think we're good to go

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.630 
think we're good to go
there's<00:02:36.959> pretty<00:02:37.200> much<00:02:37.260> no<00:02:37.500> bubbles<00:02:37.890> here<00:02:38.099> now

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
there's pretty much no bubbles here now

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.490 
there's pretty much no bubbles here now
one<00:02:38.879> thing<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.299> might<00:02:39.330> notice<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:40.110> there's<00:02:40.379> no

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
one thing you might notice is there's no

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.309 
one thing you might notice is there's no
cut<00:02:40.860> up<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.459> Apple<00:02:41.910> logo<00:02:42.330> which<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.110> bit

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
cut up for the Apple logo which is a bit

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.559 
cut up for the Apple logo which is a bit
of<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.470> shame<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:44.040> could<00:02:44.849> definitely<00:02:45.000> see<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
of a shame I could definitely see this

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.759 
of a shame I could definitely see this
as<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> negative<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.349> some<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.650> guys

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
personally I would like the Apple logo

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.550 
personally I would like the Apple logo
to<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.640> cut<00:02:50.640> out<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> really

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
to be cut out there but this is a really

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.970 
to be cut out there but this is a really
nice<00:02:52.799> skin<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.370> I'm<00:02:53.459> actually<00:02:53.610> okay<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.480> it

peel<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.040> off<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> suppose<00:03:21.590> just<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:22.739> the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
peel it off I suppose just get the

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.940 
peel it off I suppose just get the
corner<00:03:23.510> yep<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.810> pretty<00:03:25.470> good<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.829> comes

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
corner yep that is pretty good it comes

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.740 
corner yep that is pretty good it comes
off<00:03:26.190> really<00:03:26.430> easily<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.910> would<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.389> worried

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
off really easily I would not be worried

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.910 
off really easily I would not be worried
and<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.019> feels<00:03:28.200> really<00:03:28.380> durable

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and it feels really durable

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.620 
and it feels really durable
it<00:03:29.040> doesn't<00:03:29.340> feel<00:03:29.459> super<00:03:29.819> sticky<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.450> or

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
it doesn't feel super sticky like or

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.900 
it doesn't feel super sticky like or
anything<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.549> liking<00:03:32.730> this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
material so that's pretty much a stop of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.099

so it's open that up and here we have
kind<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.549> instructions<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.419> believe<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.930> line

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
kind of instructions I believe just line

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.440 
kind of instructions I believe just line
up<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.349> camera<00:04:16.829> hole<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.150> get

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
up the camera hole and then you can get

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.099 
up the camera hole and then you can get
most<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.019> lined<00:04:19.889> up<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.250> your<00:04:20.370> device<00:04:20.609> and

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
most of it lined up on your device and

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:28.370 
most of it lined up on your device and
here<00:04:22.130> just<00:04:23.130> peel<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.669> up

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.659 

all<00:04:29.380> right<00:04:29.500> so<00:04:29.710> looking<00:04:30.010> good<00:04:30.160> just<00:04:30.370> clean<00:04:30.639> up

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
all right so looking good just clean up

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.060 
all right so looking good just clean up
my<00:04:30.880> device<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.360> little<00:04:31.570> bit<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.229> I'm<00:04:32.800> gonna

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
my device a little bit and I'm gonna

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.010 
my device a little bit and I'm gonna
stick<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.310> thing<00:04:33.669> on<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:36.389> so<00:04:37.389> line<00:04:37.660> up<00:04:37.690> that

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
stick this thing on that so line up that

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.280 
stick this thing on that so line up that
camera<00:04:38.410> cutout<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.330> then<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.510> should<00:04:40.870> be<00:04:41.080> on

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
camera cutout and then we should be on

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.030 
camera cutout and then we should be on
our<00:04:41.320> way

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
our way

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.250 
our way
this<00:04:42.760> is<00:04:42.940> actually<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.330> little<00:04:43.660> bit<00:04:43.780> trickier

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
this is actually a little bit trickier

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.480 
this is actually a little bit trickier
than<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.620> laptop<00:04:44.800> skin<00:04:47.250> I'm<00:04:48.250> actually

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
than the laptop skin I'm actually

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.210 
than the laptop skin I'm actually
recording<00:04:49.389> after<00:04:49.900> I've<00:04:50.050> filmed<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.040> I'm

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
recording after I've filmed this so I'm

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.070 
recording after I've filmed this so I'm
going<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.610> fast<00:04:51.880> forward<00:04:52.030> because<00:04:52.449> I<00:04:52.720> kind<00:04:52.990> of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
going to fast forward because I kind of

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.379 
going to fast forward because I kind of
fail<00:04:53.290> at<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.639> little<00:04:54.880> bit<00:04:55.030> trickier

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
fail at it it is a little bit trickier

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.480 
fail at it it is a little bit trickier
than<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.540> laptop<00:04:55.690> skin<00:04:56.139> I'd<00:04:56.350> say<00:04:56.650> if<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.310> want

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
than the laptop skin I'd say if you want

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.159 
than the laptop skin I'd say if you want
to<00:04:57.550> get<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.790> on<00:04:57.880> perfectly<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.660> will<00:04:58.870> take

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
to get it on perfectly it will take

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.600 
to get it on perfectly it will take
about<00:04:59.289> five<00:04:59.710> minutes<00:04:59.919> if<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.220> want<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.490> be

like a perfectionist with it but

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.480 
like a perfectionist with it but
otherwise<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.710> can<00:05:02.800> get<00:05:02.949> it<00:05:03.070> on<00:05:03.160> pretty<00:05:03.430> well

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
otherwise you can get it on pretty well

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.480 
otherwise you can get it on pretty well
pretty<00:05:04.090> quickly<00:05:04.560> so<00:05:05.560> just<00:05:05.590> finishing<00:05:06.160> up<00:05:06.280> here

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
aligned pretty well it did take a while

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.200 
aligned pretty well it did take a while
like<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.050> said<00:05:11.320> but<00:05:12.250> it's<00:05:12.370> looking<00:05:12.729> really<00:05:12.940> nice

you can see that gloss again on the skin
which<00:05:15.910> makes<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.330> look<00:05:16.479> really<00:05:17.050> really<00:05:17.560> nice
