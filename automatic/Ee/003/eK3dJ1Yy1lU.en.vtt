to change it within the boundaries the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.670 
to change it within the boundaries the
way<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.790> our<00:00:05.910> society<00:00:06.240> works<00:00:06.629> moments<00:00:07.230> or<00:00:07.319> in

a political fashion as it where is it to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.879 
a political fashion as it where is it to
embrace<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:11.670> more<00:00:12.179> almost<00:00:12.750> existential<00:00:13.620> way

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
embrace this more almost existential way

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.810 
embrace this more almost existential way
of<00:00:14.070> looking<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.580> ourselves<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.699> know

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
of looking at ourselves and the you know

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.630 
of looking at ourselves and the you know
the<00:00:17.970> our<00:00:18.449> futures<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.320> were<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the our futures it were I think the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
the our futures it were I think the
first<00:00:20.820> thing<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.150> need<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.869> need<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.500> need

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
first thing we need is we need we need

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.140 
first thing we need is we need we need
to<00:00:23.189> increase<00:00:25.099> scientific<00:00:26.099> study<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> many

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to increase scientific study of many

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
to increase scientific study of many
many<00:00:27.390> things<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.050> science<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> only

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
many things because science is the only

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.849 
many things because science is the only
thing<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.119> save<00:00:30.330> us<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.859> we

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
thing that is going to save us and we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.459 
thing that is going to save us and we
need<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.669> politics<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> science

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
need to get politics out of science

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.310 
need to get politics out of science
that's<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.100> thing

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
that's the first thing

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.830 
that's the first thing
need<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.190> give<00:00:37.370> them<00:00:37.700> some<00:00:37.880> freedom<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.600> work

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
need to give them some freedom to work

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.290 
need to give them some freedom to work
on<00:00:39.110> what<00:00:39.470> really<00:00:40.190> matters<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.000> quit

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
on what really matters and quit

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.420 
on what really matters and quit
controlling<00:00:41.480> science<00:00:42.320> politically<00:00:43.280> speaking

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
controlling science politically speaking

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.600 
controlling science politically speaking
and<00:00:44.140> then<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.260> need<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.530> listen<00:00:45.770> to<00:00:46.430> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
and then we need to listen to the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.590 
and then we need to listen to the
consensus<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.390> scientists<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:49.730> think

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
consensus of scientists and I think

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.180 
consensus of scientists and I think
that's<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.809> first<00:00:51.079> thing<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:51.379> need<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.559> do<00:00:51.860> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
that's the first thing we need to do and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.610 
that's the first thing we need to do and
as<00:00:52.670> far<00:00:53.330> as<00:00:53.510> politics<00:00:54.110> well<00:00:55.930> I'm<00:00:56.930> not<00:00:57.230> too<00:00:57.410> sure

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
as far as politics well I'm not too sure

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.200 
as far as politics well I'm not too sure
that<00:00:57.650> anything<00:00:58.040> can<00:00:58.309> be<00:00:58.460> done<00:00:58.610> politically

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that anything can be done politically

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.930 
that anything can be done politically
it's<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.839> know<00:00:59.960> I'm<00:01:00.110> not<00:01:00.260> really<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.940> I

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
it's you know I'm not really I I

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.910 
it's you know I'm not really I I
couldn't<00:01:02.720> even<00:01:02.780> suggest<00:01:03.290> anything<00:01:03.589> along

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
couldn't even suggest anything along

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
done through science I mean the only way

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.620 
done through science I mean the only way
you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:09.020> deal<00:01:09.229> with<00:01:09.789> deal<00:01:10.789> with<00:01:10.940> politics<00:01:11.420> is

through science mmm deed and what do you
work<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.649> at<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.830> moment<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.100> mentioned<00:01:16.369> that

holes<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.409> where<00:02:06.829> will<00:02:06.979> people<00:02:07.040> be<00:02:07.340> able<00:02:07.460> to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
holes so where will people be able to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.729 
holes so where will people be able to
find<00:02:07.880> your<00:02:08.149> book<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.019> book<00:02:09.170> shops<00:02:09.470> and

under what heading does it go it's that

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.350 
under what heading does it go it's that
a<00:02:12.739> cause<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:12.980> frustration<00:02:13.579> is<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.239> that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
a cause of frustration is but that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.910 
a cause of frustration is but that
exhalation<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.079> breath<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.470> sounds<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:15.769> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
exhalation of breath it sounds like it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.220 
exhalation of breath it sounds like it
might<00:02:16.130> be<00:02:16.370> yeah<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.510> there's<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.079> much

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
might be yeah because there's so much

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.819 
might be yeah because there's so much
science<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.430> yet<00:02:19.610> there<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:21.140> certain

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
science in it and yet there is a certain

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.500 
science in it and yet there is a certain
amount<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.160> paranormal<00:02:22.790> there's<00:02:23.180> para

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
amount of paranormal there's para

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.150 
amount of paranormal there's para
science<00:02:24.079> there<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:25.329> religion<00:02:26.329> there<00:02:26.690> is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
science there is religion there is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270 
science there is religion there is
alchemy<00:02:28.160> there<00:02:28.519> is<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.739> it's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
alchemy there is it's it's just it's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.740 
alchemy there is it's it's just it's
just<00:02:31.730> really<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.959> no<00:02:33.530> niche<00:02:33.950> book<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:35.540> funny

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
just really a no niche book it's funny

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750 
just really a no niche book it's funny
whenever<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:36.709> talk<00:02:37.160> about<00:02:37.340> science

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
whenever we talk about science

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.420 
whenever we talk about science
particularly<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.540> program

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
particularly on this program

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.680 
particularly on this program
increasingly<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.120> scientists<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.630> we

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
increasingly and the scientists that we

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.069 
increasingly and the scientists that we
talked<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.170> want<00:02:42.380> us<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.620> embrace<00:02:42.769> science

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
talked you want us to embrace science

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.720 
talked you want us to embrace science
maybe<00:02:45.079> more<00:02:45.290> holistically<00:02:45.739> look<00:02:46.010> at<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> not

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
maybe more holistically look at it not

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.150 
maybe more holistically look at it not
as<00:02:46.910> strict<00:02:47.389> disciplines<00:02:48.079> you<00:02:48.620> know<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.769> make

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
as strict disciplines you know to make

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.120 
as strict disciplines you know to make
sure<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.489> we're<00:02:49.609> aware<00:02:49.699> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
sure that we're aware of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.640 
sure that we're aware of
all<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.640> these<00:02:50.760> things<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.240> join<00:02:51.600> together<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
all of these things do join together so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.010 
all of these things do join together so
we're<00:02:52.860> moving<00:02:53.190> away<00:02:53.280> from<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> good

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
we're moving away from is this a good

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.480 
we're moving away from is this a good
thing<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.290> far<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.710> concerned<00:02:55.740> moving

they into exactly intertwined one of the
big<00:03:03.270> problems<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.990> I've<00:03:04.140> seen<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.770> I've<00:03:04.980> gone

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
big problems that I've seen as I've gone

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.770 
big problems that I've seen as I've gone
through<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.580> scientific<00:03:06.120> literature<00:03:06.150> and

through the scientific literature and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.970 
through the scientific literature and
I've<00:03:06.900> been<00:03:07.050> able<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> consult<00:03:07.830> with

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I've been able to consult with

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.580 
I've been able to consult with
scientists<00:03:08.640> directly<00:03:09.300> for<00:03:10.260> some<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
scientists directly for some of the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.070 
scientists directly for some of the
material<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.310> book<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.930> ask

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
material in the book and to ask

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.110 
material in the book and to ask
questions<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:14.040> have<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.370> questions<00:03:14.850> answered

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
questions and have my questions answered

questions and have my questions answered
by<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.510> experts<00:03:15.960> in<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.380> field<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.700> one

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
by the experts in the field and the one

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.720 
by the experts in the field and the one
thing<00:03:18.090> I've<00:03:18.240> noticed<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:19.470> is

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
thing I've noticed is is that there is

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.160 
thing I've noticed is is that there is
you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.760> scientists<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.540> one<00:03:21.690> field<00:03:21.870> don't

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
you know scientists in one field don't

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.440 
you know scientists in one field don't
talk<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.710> much<00:03:22.910> scientists<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.030> other<00:03:24.150> fields

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
talk so much scientists and other fields

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.520 
talk so much scientists and other fields
for<00:03:24.570> example<00:03:26.180> lowest<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.360> my<00:03:27.540> list<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
for example lowest on my list and I and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.560 
for example lowest on my list and I and
I<00:03:28.740> really<00:03:29.130> apologize<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:30.000> some<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.390> out

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
I really apologize to some of you out

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.130 
I really apologize to some of you out

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
there but kind of lowest on my list are

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.740 
there but kind of lowest on my list are
Egyptologists<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:38.090> I'm<00:03:39.090> extremely

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
Egyptologists I have a I'm extremely

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.230 
Egyptologists I have a I'm extremely
frustrated<00:03:40.020> with<00:03:40.650> them<00:03:40.830> because<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:42.150> know

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
frustrated with them because you know

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.980 
frustrated with them because you know
all<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.480> our<00:03:42.780> history<00:03:43.050> our<00:03:43.940> entire<00:03:44.940> history<00:03:45.300> as

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
all of our history our entire history as

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.870 
all of our history our entire history as
we<00:03:46.260> understand<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.220> know<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.670> its

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
we understand it and know it as its

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.120 
we understand it and know it as its
promulgated<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.230> know<00:03:49.350> popularly<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
promulgated in you know popularly is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.790 
promulgated in you know popularly is
based<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.390> what<00:03:51.920> Egyptologists<00:03:53.030> decide<00:03:54.030> about

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
based on what Egyptologists decide about

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.780 
based on what Egyptologists decide about
chronology<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:57.830> Egyptologists<00:03:58.830> really

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
chronology and Egyptologists really

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.240 
chronology and Egyptologists really
really<00:04:00.540> need<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:01.400> learn<00:04:02.400> some<00:04:02.460> science<00:04:04.250> it's

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
really need to learn some science it's
