these<00:04:03.860> into<00:04:03.920> little<00:04:04.160> Clips<00:04:05.710> came<00:04:06.710> a<00:04:06.830> little

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
these into little Clips came a little

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.590 
these into little Clips came a little
west's<00:04:07.370> into<00:04:07.580> little<00:04:07.790> clips<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.240> could<00:04:08.390> clip

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
west's into little clips that could clip

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.840 
west's into little clips that could clip
in<00:04:08.750> underneath<00:04:09.080> her<00:04:09.410> hair<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.460> didn't<00:04:10.760> get

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
in underneath her hair but I didn't get

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.050 
in underneath her hair but I didn't get
any<00:04:11.000> clips<00:04:11.390> from<00:04:12.190> Goodwill<00:04:13.190> when<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.460> went<00:04:13.760> and

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
any clips from Goodwill when I went and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.460 
any clips from Goodwill when I went and
that<00:04:14.210> would<00:04:14.300> kind<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.930> be<00:04:15.080> defeating<00:04:15.410> the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
that would kind of be defeating the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.750 
that would kind of be defeating the
purpose<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.950> dumpster<00:04:16.280> dollar<00:04:16.460> challenge

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
purpose of the dumpster dollar challenge

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.530 
purpose of the dumpster dollar challenge
but<00:04:17.270> at<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.200> point<00:04:18.410> I've<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:19.540> spending

but at this point I've you know spending

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.240 
but at this point I've you know spending
$20.00<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.290> needle<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.799> don't<00:04:21.979> think<00:04:22.160> was

grit paper and then that didn't get it
perfect<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.230> got<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.560> close<00:04:42.770> enough<00:04:42.980> that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
perfect but it got it close enough that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.780 
perfect but it got it close enough that

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
three different colors of nail polish on

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.440 
three different colors of nail polish on
the<00:05:14.660> back<00:05:14.840> there

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.410 

I<00:05:17.650> used<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.770> green<00:05:19.010> around<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.400> outside<00:05:19.910> which

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
I used a green around the outside which

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.700 
I used a green around the outside which
is<00:05:20.450> reading<00:05:20.810> more<00:05:20.930> blue<00:05:21.080> because<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.410> Glatt

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
is reading more blue because the Glatt

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.650 
is reading more blue because the Glatt
the<00:05:21.890> plastic<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.430> blue<00:05:22.670> and<00:05:23.410> then<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:25.180> used<00:05:26.180> a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
the plastic is blue and then I used a

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.060 
the plastic is blue and then I used a
pale<00:05:27.910> your<00:05:28.910> doesn't<00:05:29.300> shell<00:05:29.630> color<00:05:29.960> around<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
pale your doesn't shell color around the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.670 
pale your doesn't shell color around the
pupil<00:05:31.280> but<00:05:31.760> it's<00:05:32.750> reading<00:05:32.990> it's<00:05:33.020> more<00:05:33.230> purple

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
pupil but it's reading it's more purple

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.360 
pupil but it's reading it's more purple
because<00:05:34.160> again<00:05:34.490> because<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:35.560> come<00:05:36.560> on<00:05:36.740> camera

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
because again because of come on camera

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.610 
because again because of come on camera
and<00:05:37.760> then<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.270> center<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.720> actually<00:05:39.230> a<00:05:39.260> deep

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
and then the center is actually a deep

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.360 
and then the center is actually a deep
glittery<00:05:40.340> purple<00:05:41.350> looks<00:05:42.350> black<00:05:42.620> most<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:43.310> the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
glittery purple looks black most of the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.810 
glittery purple looks black most of the
time<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:45.320> pretty<00:05:45.560> happy<00:05:45.650> with<00:05:46.460> how<00:05:46.610> this

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
time but I'm pretty happy with how this

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.550 
time but I'm pretty happy with how this
turned<00:05:46.880> out<00:05:47.270> after<00:05:47.540> all<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.260> shenanigans

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
really really like how it turned out

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.830 
really really like how it turned out
I'll<00:05:55.490> have<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.700> get<00:05:55.820> some<00:05:55.970> photos<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.510> it<00:05:56.630> I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
I'll have to get some photos of it I

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.880 
I'll have to get some photos of it I
plan<00:05:57.620> on<00:05:57.680> taking<00:05:57.830> photos<00:05:58.190> once<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.460> get<00:05:58.640> the<00:05:59.890> the

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
plan on taking photos once I get the the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.710 
plan on taking photos once I get the the
eyelid<00:06:01.280> painted<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:01.940> new<00:06:02.060> eyelashes<00:06:02.540> put

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
eyelid painted and the new eyelashes put

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.180 
eyelid painted and the new eyelashes put
in<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.110> then<00:06:03.260> I'll<00:06:03.410> do<00:06:03.590> it<00:06:03.680> before<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.100> after

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
in and then I'll do it before and after

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.130 
in and then I'll do it before and after
shot<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:04.940> then<00:06:05.540> I<00:06:05.570> think<00:06:05.810> this<00:06:05.990> one's

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
shot and then I think this one's

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.180 
shot and then I think this one's
actually<00:06:06.350> gonna<00:06:06.410> end<00:06:06.530> up<00:06:06.710> being<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:06.950> blind

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
actually gonna end up being the blind

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.460 
actually gonna end up being the blind
eye<00:06:08.470> once<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.590> get<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.860> painted<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.840> this<00:06:12.350> one

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
eye once I get it painted so this one

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.960 
eye once I get it painted so this one
actually<00:06:12.590> reflects<00:06:13.070> like<00:06:13.280> even<00:06:13.580> better<00:06:13.760> than

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
actually reflects like even better than

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.570 
actually reflects like even better than
the<00:06:14.060> original<00:06:14.090> now<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.169> at<00:06:16.130> least<00:06:16.220> we<00:06:16.430> had<00:06:16.550> some

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
the original now so at least we had some

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.520 
the original now so at least we had some
really<00:06:16.970> happy<00:06:17.300> news<00:06:17.450> with<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:17.780> eyes<00:06:17.930> I<00:06:17.960> think

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
really happy news with the eyes I think

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.500 
really happy news with the eyes I think
they're<00:06:18.800> far<00:06:19.220> more<00:06:19.460> interesting<00:06:20.180> than<00:06:20.450> the

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
they're far more interesting than the

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.390 
they're far more interesting than the
eyes<00:06:20.840> as<00:06:21.200> she<00:06:21.230> came<00:06:21.500> with<00:06:21.740> and<00:06:21.980> maybe<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.370> eye

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
eyes as she came with and maybe the eye

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.400 
eyes as she came with and maybe the eye
thing<00:06:22.790> happened<00:06:23.150> so<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.419> we'd<00:06:23.810> come<00:06:24.050> up<00:06:24.110> with

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
thing happened so that we'd come up with

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.300 
thing happened so that we'd come up with
that<00:06:24.680> blind<00:06:25.490> eye<00:06:25.730> idea<00:06:26.150> I<00:06:27.010> don't<00:06:28.010> know<00:06:28.070> but

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
that blind eye idea I don't know but

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.350 
that blind eye idea I don't know but
that<00:06:28.430> one's<00:06:28.580> so<00:06:28.700> pretty<00:06:28.730> that<00:06:29.120> I'm<00:06:29.180> almost

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
that one's so pretty that I'm almost

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.930 
that one's so pretty that I'm almost
tempted<00:06:29.660> not<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.020> use<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:30.350> blind<00:06:30.680> eye<00:06:30.830> idea<00:06:31.130> but

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.880 
tempted not to use a blind eye idea but
I<00:06:31.970> think<00:06:32.750> I<00:06:32.900> think<00:06:33.140> she<00:06:33.169> needs<00:06:33.410> it<00:06:33.530> I<00:06:33.680> think
