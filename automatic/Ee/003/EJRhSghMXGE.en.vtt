00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.860 
didn't have exam and we didn't have a
full<00:03:17.650> copy<00:03:17.829> full<00:03:18.459> for<00:03:18.699> Marauders<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.810> they

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
full copy full for Marauders and they

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.149 
full copy full for Marauders and they
weren't<00:03:20.019> hogs<00:03:20.199> a<00:03:20.349> thorough<00:03:20.530> necromancer<00:03:20.919> so<00:03:21.129> I

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
weren't hogs a thorough necromancer so I

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.979 
weren't hogs a thorough necromancer so I
think<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.519> we<00:03:21.639> would<00:03:21.819> have<00:03:21.870> went<00:03:22.870> with<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
think if we would have went with a

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.750 
think if we would have went with a
little<00:03:23.229> bit<00:03:23.409> further<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:24.459> might<00:03:24.609> have<00:03:24.729> found

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
little bit further we might have found

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.539 
little bit further we might have found
this<00:03:25.030> build<00:03:25.859> but<00:03:26.859> I'm<00:03:26.949> definitely<00:03:27.069> excited<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
we're excited so do you think this deck

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.339 
we're excited so do you think this deck
is<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.609> flash<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.970> pan<00:03:43.030> one<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> GP<00:03:44.199> or

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
is just a flash in the pan one the GP or

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.360 
is just a flash in the pan one the GP or
do<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:44.470> think<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.680> actually<00:03:44.799> has<00:03:45.069> a<00:03:45.099> chance<00:03:45.310> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
do you think it actually has a chance to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.740 
do you think it actually has a chance to
stick<00:03:45.579> around<00:03:45.609> because<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.239> hasn't<00:03:46.389> placed

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
stick around because it hasn't placed

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.469 
stick around because it hasn't placed
since<00:03:47.139> then<00:03:47.349> yeah<00:03:48.189> I<00:03:48.220> mean<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.639> think<00:03:48.729> it's<00:03:49.060> kind

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
since then yeah I mean I think it's kind

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.929 
since then yeah I mean I think it's kind
of<00:03:49.540> both<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.199> be<00:03:50.319> honest<00:03:50.699> because<00:03:51.699> I<00:03:51.879> think

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
of both to be honest because I think

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.719 
of both to be honest because I think
it's<00:03:52.180> kind<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.509> metagame<00:03:52.780> deck<00:03:53.169> I<00:03:53.889> think<00:03:54.609> it

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
it's kind of a metagame deck I think it

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.830 
it's kind of a metagame deck I think it
is<00:03:54.759> the<00:03:54.909> kind<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.120> deck<00:03:55.269> that's<00:03:55.449> going<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.629> prey

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
is the kind of deck that's going to prey

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.140 
is the kind of deck that's going to prey
on<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.019> deck<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.319> on<00:03:56.889> decks<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.759> can't

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
on a deck that on decks that just can't

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.719 
on a deck that on decks that just can't
interact<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.799> there<00:04:00.220> are<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.340> lot<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.489> decks

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
interact but there are a lot of decks

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.210 
interact but there are a lot of decks
that<00:04:00.909> play<00:04:01.569> black<00:04:01.870> creatures<00:04:02.290> or<00:04:02.769> whatever

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
that play black creatures or whatever

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.649 
that play black creatures or whatever
we're<00:04:03.370> mogas<00:04:03.669> Marauders<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.299> not<00:04:04.389> kind<00:04:04.569> of

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
we're mogas Marauders just not kind of

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.219 
we're mogas Marauders just not kind of
not<00:04:04.870> really<00:04:04.900> doing<00:04:05.199> enough<00:04:05.560> or<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:07.840> decks<00:04:08.109> that

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
not really doing enough or or decks that

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.589 
not really doing enough or or decks that
are<00:04:08.349> just<00:04:08.500> like<00:04:08.650> able<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.250> interact<00:04:09.729> faster<00:04:10.359> I

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
are just like able to interact faster I

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.659 
are just like able to interact faster I
think<00:04:11.259> the<00:04:11.319> white<00:04:11.470> we<00:04:11.590> need<00:04:11.769> X<00:04:11.919> like<00:04:12.159> has<00:04:12.639> a

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
think the white we need X like has a

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.979 
think the white we need X like has a
very<00:04:12.939> good<00:04:13.090> matchup<00:04:13.359> against<00:04:13.569> this<00:04:13.659> kind<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.900> a

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
very good matchup against this kind of a

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.199 
very good matchup against this kind of a
duck<00:04:14.169> just<00:04:14.349> because<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.889> can<00:04:15.040> put<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:16.000> same

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
duck just because it can put the same

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.909 
duck just because it can put the same
kind<00:04:16.389> of<00:04:16.509> guys<00:04:16.659> in<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.870> play<00:04:17.019> earlier<00:04:17.380> but<00:04:17.590> guys

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
kind of guys in a play earlier but guys

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.830 
kind of guys in a play earlier but guys
like<00:04:17.949> precinct<00:04:18.609> captain<00:04:19.000> or<00:04:19.180> whatever<00:04:19.449> just<00:04:19.659> a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
like precinct captain or whatever just a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.110 
like precinct captain or whatever just a
beating<00:04:20.169> for<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.380> stuff<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.590> deal<00:04:20.829> with<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.699> i

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
beating for the stuff to deal with so i

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.089 
beating for the stuff to deal with so i
think<00:04:22.779> i<00:04:23.110> think<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.380> is<00:04:23.409> definitely<00:04:23.860> a

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
think i think it is definitely a

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.640 
think i think it is definitely a
metagame<00:04:24.389> definitely<00:04:25.389> comes<00:04:25.510> down<00:04:25.719> to<00:04:25.930> you

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
metagame definitely comes down to you

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.670 
metagame definitely comes down to you
know<00:04:26.710> what<00:04:26.950> what<00:04:27.159> are

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
know what what are

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.560 
know what what are
people<00:04:27.860> playing<00:04:28.100> but<00:04:28.490> depending<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.419> what

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
people playing but depending on what

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.200 
people playing but depending on what
that<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.199> it's<00:04:30.440> very<00:04:30.500> good<00:04:30.850> yep<00:04:31.850> now

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
that is I think it's very good yep now

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.680 
that is I think it's very good yep now
it's<00:04:32.330> important<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.810> note<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:34.690> cackler
