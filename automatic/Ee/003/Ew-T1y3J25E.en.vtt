00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 hello friends welcome to another 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.609
 lfg teacher clothing today coming back on 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.359
 breathalyzer theme 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:33.780
 here is the subject of breathalyzer again 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:38.129
 the stj no hc ufu 7 7 9 4 217 7 942 finishes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.340
 decide that it is sufficient to examine the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.890
 breathalyzer also called a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.329
 this is enough to prove drunkenness 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.079
 of the guy on the steering wheel, that's all. 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.120
 enough 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.989
 you do not necessarily need to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.969
 blood 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.120
 The ideal would be a blood test that is more 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.059
 I need more correct but the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.739
 Breathalyzer says here what happened 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 the judge of first instance on the river 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 the southern one acquitted the defendant 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.290
 relying on the breathalyzer exam 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.549
 the tj of the rio grande do sul condemned the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.200
 stj now ratifies confirms condemnation 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.930
 of the tj saying the breathalyzer is enough is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.509
 the technical means proving that the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.619
 subject is drunk at that limit 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.540
 that we know 0.6 decigrams of alcohol 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.780
 per liter of blood 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 then it is not necessarily necessary to 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.579
 blood test 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.479
 that's what decided the stj but beware 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.130
 there if you have technical evidence 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.180
 bring reliability down to veracity 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.920
 of the breathalyzer 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.939
 you have to present your evidence 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.770
 techniques as counter-proofs so that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.140
 so it's okay to see if it has 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.570
 certainty is not sure but it is necessary 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.860
 that you present a counter-proof 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 questioning the reliability of the 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.210
 there is no such technical test 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.950
 then the breathalyzer is admitted as 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:22.980
 enough proof so understood the stj hc 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.980
 17 7 942 onwards
