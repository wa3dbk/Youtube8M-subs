00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 
like I guess it supposed to be a

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.399 
like I guess it supposed to be a
flamethrower<00:03:23.999> but<00:03:24.999> it<00:03:25.299> only<00:03:25.450> shoots<00:03:25.870> like

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
flamethrower but it only shoots like

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.479 
flamethrower but it only shoots like
bursts<00:03:27.069> like<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.939> doesn't<00:03:28.299> stay<00:03:29.189> you<00:03:30.189> shoot

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
bursts like it doesn't stay you shoot

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.899 
bursts like it doesn't stay you shoot
once<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.569> like<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:33.090> Breath<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.239> Fire

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
once and it's like a Breath of Fire

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.890 
once and it's like a Breath of Fire
it's<00:03:36.909> crap

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.729
