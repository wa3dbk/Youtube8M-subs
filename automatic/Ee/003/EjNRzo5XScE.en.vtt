on the smoker write it at the same time

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.010 
on the smoker write it at the same time
the<00:02:30.460> fish<00:02:30.640> get<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.450> they'll<00:02:31.690> be<00:02:31.840> done

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
the fish get there and they'll be done

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.990 
the fish get there and they'll be done
about<00:02:32.140> 20<00:02:32.560> minutes<00:02:33.010> after<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.610> fish<00:02:33.790> they

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
about 20 minutes after the fish they

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.060 
about 20 minutes after the fish they
take<00:02:34.150> about<00:02:34.360> 40<00:02:34.750> minutes<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.290> cook<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.650> and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
take about 40 minutes to cook up and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.400 
take about 40 minutes to cook up and
that's<00:02:36.670> because<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.330> bacon<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.080> thick

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
that's because the bacon is so thick

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.320 
that's because the bacon is so thick
even<00:02:38.680> though<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.340> thin<00:02:39.580> bacon<00:02:39.850> you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
even though this is thin bacon you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330 
even though this is thin bacon you
should<00:02:40.420> probably<00:02:40.600> do<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.110> quicker<00:02:42.100> with

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
should probably do it a quicker with
