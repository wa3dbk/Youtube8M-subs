one<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.859> most<00:00:05.040> common<00:00:05.460> questions<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.000> get

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
one of the most common questions I get

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.390 
one of the most common questions I get
at<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> gilded<00:00:06.750> planet<00:00:07.140> comm<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.890> how<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
at the gilded planet comm is how is the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.040 
at the gilded planet comm is how is the
leaf<00:00:08.580> packaged<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> difference

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
leaf packaged what is the difference

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.890 
leaf packaged what is the difference
between<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.650> loose<00:00:10.920> leaf<00:00:11.160> book<00:00:11.940> or<00:00:12.210> Patten<00:00:12.690> leaf

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
between a loose leaf book or Patten leaf

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.369 
between a loose leaf book or Patten leaf
book<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.559> transfer<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.460> ribbon<00:00:14.820> leaf<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.599> good

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
book or transfer or ribbon leaf or good

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.950 
book or transfer or ribbon leaf or good
leaf<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.770> rolls<00:00:17.270> well<00:00:18.270> essentially<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.810> leaf

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
leaf on rolls well essentially the leaf

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
leaf on rolls well essentially the leaf
is<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> same<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.160> packaged

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
is all the same it's just packaged

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.609 
is all the same it's just packaged
differently<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.080> example<00:00:22.320> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
differently so if here for example is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
differently so if here for example is
what<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.859> call<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> surface<00:00:23.820> book<00:00:24.090> or<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> loose

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
what we call a surface book or a loose

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
what we call a surface book or a loose
leaf<00:00:24.960> book<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.859> aluminum<00:00:26.369> leaf<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.019> simply<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
leaf book of aluminum leaf and simply a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009 
leaf book of aluminum leaf and simply a
square<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.980> five-and-a-half<00:00:29.699> inches<00:00:30.019> that's

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
square of five-and-a-half inches that's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.840 
square of five-and-a-half inches that's
separated<00:00:31.560> by<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> piece<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:31.980> tissue<00:00:32.219> paper<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
separated by a piece of tissue paper and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.200 
separated by a piece of tissue paper and
there's<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.780> after<00:00:34.200> another<00:00:34.550> 25<00:00:35.550> leaves<00:00:35.910> per

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
there's one after another 25 leaves per

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
there's one after another 25 leaves per
book<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.309> handle<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
book so the way you would handle this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.119 
book so the way you would handle this
would<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> metal<00:00:40.410> leaf<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.800> could<00:00:40.980> touch

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
would be on a metal leaf you could touch

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.979 
would be on a metal leaf you could touch
it<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.430> fingers<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.809> simply

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it with your fingers you would simply

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
it with your fingers you would simply
don't<00:00:43.260> roll<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> paperback<00:00:44.270> lay<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> onto<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
don't roll the paperback lay it onto the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
don't roll the paperback lay it onto the
surface<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.649> rub<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> back<00:00:48.090> roll

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
surface like so rub over the back roll

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.260 
surface like so rub over the back roll
it<00:00:48.750> off<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.469> let<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> leaf<00:00:50.370> expose<00:00:53.270> now

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it off and then let the leaf expose now

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
it off and then let the leaf expose now
a<00:00:54.300> patent<00:00:54.750> leaf<00:00:54.930> book<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:55.829> leaf

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
a patent leaf book is the same leaf

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.970 
a patent leaf book is the same leaf
simply<00:00:57.030> each<00:00:57.180> leaf<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.750> mounted<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> piece

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
simply each leaf is mounted on a piece

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.840 
simply each leaf is mounted on a piece
of<00:00:59.190> white<00:00:59.399> tissue<00:00:59.730> paper<00:01:01.460> makes<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.699> easy

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of white tissue paper makes it very easy

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
of white tissue paper makes it very easy
for<00:01:03.329> handling<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.710> pick<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> paper<00:01:05.369> by

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
for handling I can pick up the paper by

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
for handling I can pick up the paper by
the<00:01:05.670> paper<00:01:05.970> edge<00:01:06.240> without<00:01:06.659> ever<00:01:06.840> touching<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the paper edge without ever touching the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
the paper edge without ever touching the
leaf<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.520> cut<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.820> scissors<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
leaf I can cut it with scissors in the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.390 
leaf I can cut it with scissors in the
strip's<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.590> individually

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
strip's use those in them individually

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520 
strip's use those in them individually
so<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.760> less<00:01:11.939> waste<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.080> lay<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
so I get less waste and lay it on the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.580 
so I get less waste and lay it on the
surface<00:01:13.830> rub<00:01:14.790> over<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> paper<00:01:15.299> backing<00:01:15.600> peel

surface rub over the paper backing peel
it<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> transfer<00:01:18.110> makes<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it off like a transfer makes it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.719 
it off like a transfer makes it
particularly<00:01:19.560> good<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.070> large<00:01:20.280> flat

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
particularly good for large flat

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
particularly good for large flat
surfaces<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.900> furniture<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> objects

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
surfaces like furniture and objects

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.420 
surfaces like furniture and objects
nothing<00:01:23.939> too<00:01:24.330> ornamental<00:01:28.159> here<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.400> a

roll of aluminum leaf or ribbon leaf in
this<00:01:33.270> case<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.170> patently

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
this case it's very much like patently

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770 
this case it's very much like patently
where<00:01:35.189> one<00:01:35.430> leaf<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> laid<00:01:36.060> after<00:01:36.329> another<00:01:36.689> a

consecutive leg 50 or 75 meters you can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.469 
consecutive leg 50 or 75 meters you can
see<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> leaf<00:01:41.130> line<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.700> between<00:01:41.790> each<00:01:42.210> leaf

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
see the leaf line in between each leaf

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929 
see the leaf line in between each leaf
separating<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.409> slight<00:01:43.649> overlap<00:01:43.950> would

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
separating the slight overlap would

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
separating the slight overlap would
simply<00:01:45.299> lay<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> surface<00:01:46.250> again<00:01:47.250> rub

a<00:01:49.710> transfer<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> release<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> paper<00:01:51.439> like<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
a transfer to release the paper like so

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
a transfer to release the paper like so
excellent<00:01:54.570> product<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> use<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.380> folds<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
excellent product to use in folds and
