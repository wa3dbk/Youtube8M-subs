just disgusting
I<00:02:00.409> guess<00:02:01.039> maybe<00:02:01.669> smaller<00:02:02.119> tamia<00:02:02.569> would<00:02:02.719> be

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
I guess maybe smaller tamia would be

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.629 
I guess maybe smaller tamia would be
great<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:03.259> yeah<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.619> was<00:02:03.679> ocean<00:02:04.130> trout<00:02:04.310> and

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
great but yeah this was ocean trout and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.790 
great but yeah this was ocean trout and
it<00:02:04.729> was<00:02:04.939> quite<00:02:05.179> big<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.689> yeah<00:02:06.649> not<00:02:06.950> very<00:02:07.219> nice

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
it was quite big and yeah not very nice

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.520 
it was quite big and yeah not very nice
but<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.830> guess<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.310> highlights<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.530> actually

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
but I guess the highlights of actually

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.690 
but I guess the highlights of actually
going<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.220> Texas<00:02:13.580> when<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.850> would<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.780> been
