couldn't<00:01:54.450> mow<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.700> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
couldn't mow in there and and what I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
couldn't mow in there and and what I
found<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> watermelons<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.320> take<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
found is that watermelons really take a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.850 
found is that watermelons really take a
long<00:01:58.770> time<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.670> ripen<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> grass

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
long time to to ripen and so the grass

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.469 
long time to to ripen and so the grass
is<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.619> four<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.649> five<00:02:04.860> foot<00:02:05.100> tall

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
is now you know four or five foot tall

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.620 
is now you know four or five foot tall
because<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.840> me<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.380> my

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
because I have me out of my

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.479 
because I have me out of my
and<00:02:08.050> again<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.530> doesn't<00:02:08.709> really<00:02:08.890> matter<00:02:09.310> but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
and again it doesn't really matter but

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.919 
and again it doesn't really matter but
it's<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> little<00:02:09.819> bit<00:02:09.910> unsightly<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.780> is

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
it's a little bit unsightly and it is

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's a little bit unsightly and it is
just<00:02:11.440> something<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.680> keep<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.040> mind<00:02:12.250> when

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
just something to keep in mind when

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.680 
just something to keep in mind when
you're<00:02:12.550> planning<00:02:12.580> those<00:02:13.270> sort<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.599> things

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
you're planning those sort of things

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're planning those sort of things
like<00:02:14.500> pumpkins<00:02:15.069> cucumbers<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.030> said<00:02:16.209> not<00:02:16.330> too

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
like pumpkins cucumbers I said not too

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.580 
like pumpkins cucumbers I said not too
bad<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> can<00:02:16.810> grow<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.349> vines

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
bad you can grow them on the vines

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.229 
bad you can grow them on the vines
pumpkins<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.370> have<00:02:18.519> seen<00:02:18.760> growing<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
pumpkins I have seen growing in the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.690 
pumpkins I have seen growing in the
vines<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> trellis<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.640> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
vines on the on the on a trellis so you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.150 
vines on the on the on a trellis so you
can<00:02:21.790> grow<00:02:21.910> them<00:02:22.030> vertically<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:23.319> haven't<00:02:24.010> had

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
can grow them vertically I haven't had

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.550 
can grow them vertically I haven't had
that<00:02:24.489> much<00:02:25.209> success<00:02:25.450> doing<00:02:26.019> pumpkins

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
that much success doing pumpkins

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680 
that much success doing pumpkins
vertically<00:02:27.250> they<00:02:27.519> seem<00:02:28.090> too<00:02:28.300> particularly

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
vertically they seem too particularly

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.740 
vertically they seem too particularly
big<00:02:28.959> ones<00:02:29.140> get<00:02:29.410> too<00:02:30.099> too<00:02:30.310> heavy<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.880> drop<00:02:31.599> off

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
big ones get too too heavy and drop off

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.759 
big ones get too too heavy and drop off
pretty<00:02:32.050> early<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.310> stage<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:35.170> keep<00:02:35.650> that

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
pretty early in the stage but keep that

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.320 
pretty early in the stage but keep that
in<00:02:35.890> mind<00:02:36.069> with<00:02:36.250> watermelons<00:02:36.819> any<00:02:36.970> way<00:02:37.120> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
in mind with watermelons any way that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.300 
in mind with watermelons any way that
they<00:02:37.510> day<00:02:37.750> especially<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.410> vines<00:02:38.620> really<00:02:39.160> go

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
they day especially the vines really go

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.800 
they day especially the vines really go
a<00:02:39.340> long<00:02:39.580> way<00:02:39.760> maybe<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.239> could<00:02:40.390> train<00:02:40.660> them

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
a long way maybe you could train them

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.300 
a long way maybe you could train them
back<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> little<00:02:41.440> bit<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.709> let<00:02:42.040> them<00:02:42.130> go

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
back in a little bit I just let them go

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.490 
back in a little bit I just let them go
because<00:02:43.120> we've<00:02:43.269> got<00:02:43.420> plenty<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.750> space<00:02:43.930> anyway

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
because we've got plenty of space anyway

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.780 
because we've got plenty of space anyway
but<00:02:45.989> yeah<00:02:46.989> but<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.410> as<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.370> see<00:02:48.430> I've<00:02:48.670> got

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
but yeah but so as you can see I've got

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.190 
but yeah but so as you can see I've got
a<00:02:48.819> couple<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.150> them<00:02:49.299> here<00:02:49.569> there<00:02:49.720> they<00:02:49.900> didn't

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
a couple of them here there they didn't

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.710 
a couple of them here there they didn't
get<00:02:50.290> huge<00:02:50.790> they<00:02:51.790> maybe<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> little<00:02:52.540> bit

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
get huge they maybe can a little bit

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.130 
get huge they maybe can a little bit
late<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.290> season<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.140> probably

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
late in this season so it was probably

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.140 
late in this season so it was probably
about<00:02:56.349> midsummer<00:02:56.920> window<00:02:57.280> when<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.549> little

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
about midsummer window when the little

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.229 
about midsummer window when the little
seed<00:02:58.360> popped<00:02:58.690> up<00:02:58.870> or<00:02:59.170> accident<00:02:59.940> but<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> said<00:03:01.209> I

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
seed popped up or accident but I said I

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.830 
seed popped up or accident but I said I
let<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> go<00:03:01.690> on<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:02.049> side<00:03:02.290> but<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
let it go on that side but the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.150 
let it go on that side but the
watermelons<00:03:05.349> are<00:03:05.440> scattered<00:03:05.769> out<00:03:05.890> all<00:03:06.040> over

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
watermelons are scattered out all over

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.069 
watermelons are scattered out all over
the<00:03:06.310> place<00:03:06.370> but<00:03:06.819> I've<00:03:06.970> got<00:03:07.120> through<00:03:07.390> these<00:03:07.870> are

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the place but I've got through these are

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.780 
the place but I've got through these are
these<00:03:08.410> are<00:03:08.440> probably<00:03:08.860> one<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.130> first<00:03:09.519> ones

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
these are probably one of the first ones

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.330 
these are probably one of the first ones
that<00:03:10.000> came<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.870> vine<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.190> they

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that came on the on the vine and they

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.250 
that came on the on the vine and they
grow<00:03:12.549> really<00:03:12.910> rapidly<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.600> amazing<00:03:14.079> it's<00:03:14.200> so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
grow really rapidly it's amazing it's so

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.960 
grow really rapidly it's amazing it's so
cool<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.680> watch<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.950> automatic<00:03:15.430> swell<00:03:15.760> up

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
cool to watch the automatic swell up

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.150 
cool to watch the automatic swell up
they<00:03:16.150> they<00:03:16.359> really<00:03:16.510> grow<00:03:16.810> pretty<00:03:17.079> fast<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.920> I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
they they really grow pretty fast and I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.559 
they they really grow pretty fast and I
made<00:03:18.340> sure<00:03:18.519> to<00:03:18.549> give<00:03:18.760> them<00:03:18.910> plenty<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.299> water

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
made sure to give them plenty of water

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.059 
made sure to give them plenty of water
and<00:03:19.750> keep<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.530> up<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.709> them<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:23.069> thought

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
and keep that up to them but I thought

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.759 
and keep that up to them but I thought
you<00:03:25.000> know<00:03:25.120> as<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.359> longtime<00:03:25.630> after<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.350> long<00:03:26.560> time

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
you know as a longtime after a long time

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.410 
you know as a longtime after a long time
I<00:03:26.799> thought<00:03:27.040> are<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.400> watermelons<00:03:27.970> would<00:03:28.209> be

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
I thought are the watermelons would be

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.160 
I thought are the watermelons would be
probably<00:03:29.350> right<00:03:29.709> by<00:03:29.980> now<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:31.209> probably<00:03:31.239> good

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
probably right by now it's probably good

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.009 
probably right by now it's probably good
for<00:03:32.430> months<00:03:33.430> or<00:03:33.639> so<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.150> guess<00:03:34.389> on<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.690> inside

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
for months or so I guess on the inside

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.069 
for months or so I guess on the inside
maybe<00:03:35.260> maybe<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.160> bit<00:03:36.370> longer<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:37.660> know

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079

into the kitchen went cut it open and
it<00:04:08.670> was<00:04:08.820> still<00:04:09.030> green<00:04:09.830> my<00:04:10.830> mouth<00:04:11.040> was<00:04:11.280> watering

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
it was still green my mouth was watering

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.330

waiting teeth is watermelon and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.970 
waiting teeth is watermelon and
definitely<00:04:14.340> not<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.930> I've<00:04:16.109> left<00:04:16.320> them<00:04:16.560> now<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980

and<00:04:17.280> I'm<00:04:17.430> still<00:04:17.700> hesitating<00:04:18.630> because<00:04:18.950> that

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
and I'm still hesitating because that

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.680

one when I picked the green one was

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.350 
one when I picked the green one was
probably<00:04:22.260> two<00:04:22.980> weeks<00:04:23.010> ago<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.850> thought<00:04:24.210> I'd

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
probably two weeks ago so I thought I'd

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.350 
probably two weeks ago so I thought I'd
leave<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.800> or<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.860> did<00:04:26.070> read<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:27.180> need

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
leave it or I did read was that you need

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.760 
leave it or I did read was that you need

as<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.570> see<00:04:42.780> on<00:04:42.960> that's<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.410> side<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.860> it

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
as you can see on that's that side of it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.250 
as you can see on that's that side of it
but<00:04:45.000> still<00:04:45.270> some<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.690> other<00:04:45.810> vine<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
but still some of the other vine is

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.790 
but still some of the other vine is
growing<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:48.150> think<00:04:48.840> I'm<00:04:49.350> gonna<00:04:49.530> leave

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
growing and I think I'm gonna leave

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.250 
growing and I think I'm gonna leave
these<00:04:50.040> just<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:50.610> another<00:04:50.940> one<00:04:51.720> or<00:04:51.750> two<00:04:51.870> weeks

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
these just for another one or two weeks

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.520 
these just for another one or two weeks
before<00:04:52.550> before<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> pick<00:04:53.970> them<00:04:54.150> I'm<00:04:55.080> guess<00:04:55.410> you

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
before before I pick them I'm guess you

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.800 
before before I pick them I'm guess you
could<00:04:55.680> go<00:04:55.800> over<00:04:55.830> right<00:04:56.310> but<00:04:56.640> I<00:04:56.669> think<00:04:57.150> after

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
could go over right but I think after

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.200 
could go over right but I think after
that<00:04:57.930> last<00:04:58.140> experience<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:59.010> give<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.790> a<00:04:59.940> little

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
that last experience I give it a little

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.870 
that last experience I give it a little
bit<00:05:00.390> longer<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.960> then<00:05:01.110> see<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:01.770> if<00:05:02.520> anyone's

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
bit longer and then see so if anyone's

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.990 
bit longer and then see so if anyone's
got<00:05:03.060> any<00:05:03.210> tips<00:05:03.419> or<00:05:04.050> ideas<00:05:04.110> on<00:05:04.710> how<00:05:04.890> how<00:05:05.669> you<00:05:05.730> can

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
got any tips or ideas on how how you can

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.480

thought I must be right for sure a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.170 
thought I must be right for sure a
standard<00:05:12.990> hollow<00:05:13.200> but<00:05:13.919> no<00:05:14.790> it's<00:05:15.030> definitely

for sure but I guess one of the one of

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.440 
for sure but I guess one of the one of
the<00:05:39.690> things<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.110> did<00:05:40.560> read<00:05:40.830> about<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.550> I

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
the things that I did read about and I

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.900 
the things that I did read about and I
would<00:05:43.110> recommend<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.460> other<00:05:44.610> people

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
planting watermelons is to have a look

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.310 
planting watermelons is to have a look
and<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.120> variety<00:05:48.540> that<00:05:48.690> you've<00:05:48.810> got<00:05:49.050> and

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
and of the variety that you've got and

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.930 
and of the variety that you've got and
how<00:05:49.890> long<00:05:50.610> they<00:05:50.880> recommend<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.610> the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
how long they recommend that the the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.090 
how long they recommend that the the
fruit<00:05:54.150> will<00:05:54.270> take<00:05:54.479> to<00:05:54.600> ripen<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.680> then<00:05:55.890> once

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
fruit will take to ripen and then once

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.310 
fruit will take to ripen and then once
you<00:05:56.250> see<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.729> see<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.450> first<00:05:57.690> fruit<00:05:57.990> appear

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
you see the see the first fruit appear

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.140 
you see the see the first fruit appear
maybe<00:05:58.919> mark<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.310> on<00:05:59.370> your<00:05:59.430> calendar<00:05:59.550> and<00:06:00.060> your

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
maybe mark it on your calendar and your

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.420 
maybe mark it on your calendar and your
diary<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.260> then<00:06:01.650> subtract<00:06:02.250> it<00:06:02.400> from

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
diary and and then subtract it from

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.400 
diary and and then subtract it from
there<00:06:02.820> because<00:06:03.210> then<00:06:03.660> then<00:06:03.960> you<00:06:04.080> would<00:06:04.229> know

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
there because then then you would know

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.780 
there because then then you would know
if<00:06:04.590> it's<00:06:04.740> been<00:06:04.950> as<00:06:05.160> you<00:06:05.280> see<00:06:05.430> I'm<00:06:05.550> guessing

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
if it's been as you see I'm guessing

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.909 
if it's been as you see I'm guessing
it's<00:06:06.120> four<00:06:06.479> or<00:06:06.510> five<00:06:06.870> months<00:06:07.290> it's<00:06:07.440> so<00:06:07.560> easy<00:06:07.770> to

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
it's four or five months it's so easy to

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.770 
it's four or five months it's so easy to
lose<00:06:08.490> track<00:06:08.550> or<00:06:08.970> when<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:09.300> planted<00:06:09.660> the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
lose track or when you planted the

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.930 
lose track or when you planted the
things<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:10.260> but<00:06:11.100> at<00:06:11.250> least<00:06:11.370> if<00:06:11.550> you've<00:06:11.669> got<00:06:11.850> to

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
things so but at least if you've got to

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.520 
things so but at least if you've got to
note<00:06:12.120> down<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:12.570> so<00:06:12.750> right<00:06:12.990> well<00:06:13.169> they<00:06:13.320> should

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
note down you so right well they should

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.050 
note down you so right well they should
be<00:06:13.620> right<00:06:13.800> within<00:06:13.979> four<00:06:14.370> months<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:14.880> you

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
be right within four months and you

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.760 
be right within four months and you
won't<00:06:15.419> pick<00:06:15.600> them<00:06:15.810> perhaps<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:16.200> month<00:06:16.410> earlier

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
won't pick them perhaps a month earlier

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.860 
won't pick them perhaps a month earlier
like<00:06:16.979> ideally<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.760> was<00:06:17.880> definitely<00:06:18.330> not

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
like ideally that was definitely not

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.460 
like ideally that was definitely not
