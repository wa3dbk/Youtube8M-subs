00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
under the cuffs so basically start

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160 
under the cuffs so basically start
outputting<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.970> know<00:00:40.090> cards<00:00:40.570> where<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.989> cups

outputting you know cards where the cups
would<00:00:41.350> be<00:00:41.530> we<00:00:42.250> recommend<00:00:42.790> leaving<00:00:42.970> out<00:00:43.210> this

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
would be we recommend leaving out this

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.950 
would be we recommend leaving out this
center<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.020> center<00:00:44.260> card<00:00:44.560> will<00:00:44.649> tell<00:00:44.829> you<00:00:44.920> why

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
on top of the cards it can sometimes be

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.590

difficult to grab that center card not

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.540 
difficult to grab that center card not
saying<00:00:55.840> it's<00:00:55.989> not<00:00:56.050> possible<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.430> know

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
saying it's not possible but you know

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.510 
saying it's not possible but you know
how<00:00:57.579> beer<00:00:58.000> pong<00:00:58.690> goes<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.800> table<00:01:00.100> gets<00:01:00.280> wet

how beer pong goes the table gets wet
and<00:01:00.700> then<00:01:01.030> these<00:01:01.180> cards<00:01:01.450> get<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.660> little<00:01:01.960> bit

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
and then these cards get a little bit

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.439 
and then these cards get a little bit
hard<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.320> pick<00:01:02.530> up<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.340> put<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:03.910> middle

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
hard to pick up so you put that middle

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.080 
hard to pick up so you put that middle
card<00:01:04.719> on<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.500> side<00:01:05.740> here<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:06.189> lot<00:01:06.369> of<00:01:06.549> times<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
card on the side here a lot of times the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.629 
card on the side here a lot of times the
first<00:01:07.329> cup<00:01:08.289> that<00:01:08.409> gets<00:01:08.619> made<00:01:08.829> is<00:01:09.039> that<00:01:09.100> center

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:09.639 
first cup that gets made is that center

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:11.399 
first cup that gets made is that center
Cup<00:01:09.819> so<00:01:10.509> obviously<00:01:10.810> your<00:01:10.959> move<00:01:11.079> your<00:01:11.200> center

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409

Cup so obviously your move your center
column<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:11.859> a<00:01:11.950> little<00:01:12.249> bit<00:01:12.369> hard<00:01:12.609> to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
column and it's a little bit hard to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.120 
column and it's a little bit hard to
pick<00:01:12.969> up<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.119> middle<00:01:13.509> that<00:01:13.990> middle<00:01:14.289> card<00:01:14.469> not

to<00:01:15.310> be<00:01:15.399> said<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:15.939> can't<00:01:16.299> do<00:01:16.539> it<00:01:16.719> but<00:01:17.319> it

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
to be said that you can't do it but it

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.510 
to be said that you can't do it but it
just<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.619> little<00:01:17.649> bit<00:01:17.859> easier<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.159> leave<00:01:18.369> that

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520
