00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.350
 how about youtube band this time 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.220
 we have another video a boxing 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.210
 this time from the go pro 03 the call 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.250
 most versatile camera around the world and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.260
 we chose the silver edition 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 good because we have chosen the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.330
 plate but I did not get that much attention 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.730
 because 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.540
 that obviously offered more 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.610
 resolution all but this one offered 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.130
 rather it offers 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 what interests me what is 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:48.800
 1080p video at 60 frames per second 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.329
 and then well the other pass from Caesar 4k 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.030
 well I did not have I do not have a 4k tv for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.370
 to enjoy it 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.920
 a content that could have been recorded 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.970
 with her but good here we are giving 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.930
 annoying things then but why 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.690
 and well 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.260
 the one that has it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.480
 it's very small let's see 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 what else comes inside the box we are going to 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.560
 disassemble it first 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.789
 it's pretty simple, we just have to go 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.079
 to these little screws that come and 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.079
 see nothing but small 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.070
 I recommended the Store that as 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.550
 I have no longer take 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 for a long time the protector because it is 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.650
 lens is quite fragile 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.200
 and then let's see what you bring the box 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.200
 It was great we included the stickers 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 three stickers 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.190
 obviously 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 manual 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.740
 the quick forum manual 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.290
 Well then let's read 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.539
 in detail later 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.220
 this is the complete manual where 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.890
 good here and check out coming 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.060
 all available accessories 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.060
 and many other things 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520
 In crisis 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.250
 guarantee statement 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.070
 we study we do not have to use it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.780
 Well now the one that comes the most we're going to 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.790
 be like this in all genres 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.450
 here comes another other arm with which 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.319
 We can put the bed in different 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.319
 positions 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.350
 is that the basis 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.930
 not simple and also 2 that stick 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.310
 on the surface to be able to mount the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.990
 we can paste the camera in the car 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.480
 we're not already happening 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.050
 to the back of that covers the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.780
 rotors a man 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.780
 obviously we will include the usb cable 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.209
 and finally clear 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.380
 in the lithium chamber 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:45.350
 let's hope it hurts a lot is from 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:49.740
 the rechargeable of 1,180 millÃ¡n pÃ©rez 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.120
 I hope it lasts a good time because well no longer 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.600
 there is nothing in the house that so good this 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.600
 It was the unboxing of the go pro 03 I hope 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.430
 in the future to bring you more content from 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.590
 what this camera can do 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.030
 here they will be videos with 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.120
 this camera I will record 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.860
 I do not know there on vacation to see 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.890
 where are we going 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.230
 after 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.350
 see you in a next video up 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.350
