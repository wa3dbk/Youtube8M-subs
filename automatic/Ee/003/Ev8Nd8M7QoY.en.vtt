faster than the 3rd fret of a there's
other<00:02:17.890> ways<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.100> end<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> riff<00:02:18.550> too<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:19.060> we're

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
other ways to end the riff too if we're

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:27.740 
other ways to end the riff too if we're
going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.989> D<00:02:20.319> chord<00:02:20.500> for<00:02:20.739> example<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.280> go

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.830 

or<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.050> landing<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.800> an<00:02:29.890> E<00:02:30.069> chord<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.489> could<00:02:30.610> be

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.170 

so<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.020> versatile<00:02:38.380> lift<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.709> can<00:02:38.860> end<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
so it's a versatile lift we can end it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
so it's a versatile lift we can end it
different<00:02:40.180> ways<00:02:40.300> depending<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.900> where<00:02:41.080> we're

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
different ways depending on where we're

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.840 
different ways depending on where we're
at<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.500> chord<00:02:41.709> progression<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.760> right

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
at in the chord progression for right

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.970 
at in the chord progression for right
now<00:02:43.000> let's<00:02:43.330> start<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:44.230> lake<00:02:44.380> nice<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.800> slow

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
now let's start the lake nice and slow

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.350 
now let's start the lake nice and slow
play<00:02:45.310> through<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.610> number<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.880> times<00:02:45.970> kind

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
play through it a number of times kind

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.090 
play through it a number of times kind
of<00:02:46.420> getting<00:02:46.660> faster<00:02:47.019> as<00:02:47.140> we<00:02:47.260> go<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.739> here<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.010> is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
of getting faster as we go so here it is

00:02:48.100 --> 00:03:00.170 
of getting faster as we go so here it is
nice<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.459> slow

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:11.089 

and<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.319> little<00:03:01.560> bit<00:03:01.650> faster

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:19.020 

a<00:03:11.180> little<00:03:12.180> bit<00:03:12.300> faster<00:03:12.450> yet

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.440 

and<00:03:19.540> one<00:03:19.720> more<00:03:19.870> time<00:03:20.020> little<00:03:20.320> faster

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.190 

alright<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:27.569> let's<00:03:27.750> learn<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
alright now let's learn it in the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.590 
alright now let's learn it in the
context<00:03:28.770> of<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> blues<00:03:29.160> jam<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.240> we're<00:03:30.360> gonna<00:03:30.450> be
