momentarily so while this thing is
brewing<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.490> pretty

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
brewing you see it's actually pretty

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.780

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.130 
quiet doesn't make the tribe raishin
feeling<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.969> noise<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.930> did

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
feeling and noise as the other one did

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.649 
feeling and noise as the other one did
which<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> nice<00:02:01.820> what<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
which is nice what I also like about the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
which is nice what I also like about the
coffee<00:02:03.840> maker<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> fact<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
coffee maker is the fact that the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.359 
coffee maker is the fact that the
reservoir<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.600> 70<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> 72

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
reservoir here is 70 I think into the 72

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.570 
reservoir here is 70 I think into the 72
or<00:02:08.489> 74<00:02:08.789> ounces<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.569> water<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.470> almost<00:02:11.280> another

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
or 74 ounces of water so almost another

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.500 
or 74 ounces of water so almost another
16<00:02:11.970> ounces<00:02:12.270> more

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
16 ounces more

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
16 ounces more
more<00:02:12.599> than<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> original<00:02:13.319> ones<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:14.489> this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
more than the original ones and this

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.660 
more than the original ones and this
thing<00:02:14.939> doesn't<00:02:15.299> come<00:02:15.510> off<00:02:15.659> like<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> original

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
thing doesn't come off like the original

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.280 
thing doesn't come off like the original
k<00:02:17.670> cup<00:02:17.879> series<00:02:18.180> did<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.510> actually<00:02:18.720> opens<00:02:19.200> up

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
cream so this is a two step through

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.250 
cream so this is a two step through
where<00:03:08.340> what<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.670> do<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.030> step<00:03:09.299> one<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.959> is

where what you do is step one is the is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.349 
where what you do is step one is the is
the<00:03:10.290> creamer<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.609> step<00:03:11.940> two<00:03:11.970> is

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
the creamer and then step two is

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.530 
the creamer and then step two is
actually<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.870> coffee<00:03:13.109> itself<00:03:13.409> so<00:03:14.540> my
