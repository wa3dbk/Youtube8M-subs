terribly driving but it doesn't lie

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.310 
terribly driving but it doesn't lie
anyway<00:03:19.940> still<00:03:20.940> seem<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.630> be<00:03:21.750> sticking<00:03:22.110> with

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.390 
anyway still seem to be sticking with
kitten<00:03:22.980> kitten<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> fitted<00:03:24.300> kitten

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
kitten kitten if that is fitted kitten

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.740 
kitten kitten if that is fitted kitten
whoever<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.670> they're<00:03:26.880> quite<00:03:27.120> fast<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.600> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
whoever it is they're quite fast so it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.570 
whoever it is they're quite fast so it
