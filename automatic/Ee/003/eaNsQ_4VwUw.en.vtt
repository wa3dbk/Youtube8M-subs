00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

ladarius Gunther really shined yesterday

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.920 
ladarius Gunther really shined yesterday
I<00:00:35.670> thought<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> mean<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.540> some

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I thought I mean there was some some

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.420 
I thought I mean there was some some
spots<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.710> beat<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.190> mean<00:00:38.340> he

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
spots to where he got beat but I mean he

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
spots to where he got beat but I mean he
really<00:00:38.520> showed<00:00:39.020> six-foot-two<00:00:40.020> regardless<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
really showed six-foot-two regardless of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
really showed six-foot-two regardless of
whatever<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.399> 40<00:00:41.700> time<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.120> he's<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> guy<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
whatever the 40 time is he's a guy that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.479 
whatever the 40 time is he's a guy that
looks<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.200> he<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.500> play<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.070> today<00:00:44.460> i

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
looks like he can play and today i

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010 
looks like he can play and today i
thought<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.879> damarious<00:00:45.210> Randall<00:00:45.239> show<00:00:45.750> I

mean<00:00:46.200> he<00:00:46.350> had<00:00:46.440> he<00:00:46.860> had<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.280> nice

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
mean he had he had some really nice

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.830 
mean he had he had some really nice
place<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.969> there<00:00:48.000> had<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.329> nice<00:00:48.450> batted

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
place out there had some nice batted

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
place out there had some nice batted
passes<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.879> looks<00:00:51.120> too<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
passes and really really looks too I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.580 
passes and really really looks too I
mean<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.930> stuck<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> me<00:00:52.500> was

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
mean the one that stuck out to me was

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
mean the one that stuck out to me was
that<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.640> route<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.180> Jimi

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
that that kind of go route that Jimi

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.810 
that that kind of go route that Jimi
hunt<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.440> running<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.370> left<00:00:56.579> sideline

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
hunt was running on the left sideline

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
hunt was running on the left sideline
there<00:00:57.390> deep<00:00:58.050> pass<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.890> pretty<00:00:59.010> well

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
there deep pass was actually pretty well

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
there deep pass was actually pretty well
thrown<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.609> Matt<00:00:59.760> Blanchard<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> he<00:01:00.930> gets

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
thrown from Matt Blanchard and he gets

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
thrown from Matt Blanchard and he gets
up<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.530> pops<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.370> would

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
up there and pops that thing I would

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.619 
up there and pops that thing I would
have<00:01:02.609> been<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> catch<00:01:02.940> otherwise<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> looked

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have been a catch otherwise it looked

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.850 
have been a catch otherwise it looked
like<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:03.960> he<00:01:04.080> got<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> high<00:01:04.589> point

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
like the way he got up to the high point

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.899 
like the way he got up to the high point
of<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.430> probably<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> biggest

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
of it so that was probably the biggest

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
of it so that was probably the biggest
takeaway<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.630> seeing<00:01:06.840> Randall<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
takeaway is just seeing Randall a little

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.230 
takeaway is just seeing Randall a little
bit<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.369> he<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.610> bring<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> table<00:01:09.030> he

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
bit in what he can bring the table he

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.580 
bit in what he can bring the table he
certainly<00:01:09.510> has<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.750> athleticism<00:01:10.200> that's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
certainly has the athleticism that's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
certainly has the athleticism that's
shown<00:01:10.799> early<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.280> yeah<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
shown early on yeah I think you see that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
shown early on yeah I think you see that
throughout<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.960> secondary<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.680> funny

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
throughout the secondary and it's funny

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.109 
throughout the secondary and it's funny
I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.070> Casey<00:01:14.220> Hayward<00:01:14.430> had<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> strong<00:01:14.939> day

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
I think Casey Hayward had a strong day

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.420 
I think Casey Hayward had a strong day
today<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> big<00:01:16.890> news<00:01:17.130> out

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
today as well I think the big news out

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
today as well I think the big news out
of<00:01:17.490> today<00:01:17.790> obviously<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:18.689> Jared<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of today obviously it's probably Jared a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
of today obviously it's probably Jared a

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
thinking this is like catch-22 because

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.380 
thinking this is like catch-22 because
it<00:01:34.110> wasn't<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> knee<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.579> wasn't<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> tail

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it wasn't the knee and it wasn't a tail

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
it wasn't the knee and it wasn't a tail
bone<00:01:36.630> fracture<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.140> anything<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.590> but

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bone fracture or anything like that but

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
bone fracture or anything like that but
concussions<00:01:38.759> probably<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> next<00:01:39.540> worst

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
concussions probably the next worst

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020

the<00:01:46.890> draft<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.790> were<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the draft I think they were kind of

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.370 
the draft I think they were kind of
debating<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.140> might<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.290> been

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
debating that if there might have been

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410 
debating that if there might have been
more<00:01:49.470> incidents<00:01:50.040> there<00:01:50.220> whatever<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> case

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
more incidents there whatever the case

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.649 
more incidents there whatever the case
may<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.920> his<00:01:53.130> history<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.479> tough

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
may be with his history it's a tough

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.270 
may be with his history it's a tough
break<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.229> right<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.829> he's<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.130> through

matter<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.340> though<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> playing<00:02:42.150> time

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420

you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.780> after<00:02:43.080> missing<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.980> last<00:02:44.310> try

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
you know after missing all last try

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.800 
you know after missing all last try
think<00:02:44.640> he<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.180> week<00:02:45.420> last<00:02:45.660> year

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
think he was here for a week last year

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.740 
think he was here for a week last year
before<00:02:46.050> he<00:02:46.290> toured<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> ACL<00:02:47.340> he<00:02:48.270> needs<00:02:48.660> as

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
before he toured the ACL he needs as

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.060 
before he toured the ACL he needs as
many<00:02:48.870> reps<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.560> right<00:02:49.740> now<00:02:49.770> and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
many reps as you can get right now and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.520 
many reps as you can get right now and
with<00:02:50.880> especially<00:02:51.390> how<00:02:51.510> deep<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.290> room

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
with especially how deep that that room

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.990 
with especially how deep that that room
is<00:02:52.650> right<00:02:52.860> now<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.070> way<00:02:53.250> Jeff<00:02:53.550> Janice<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
is right now the way Jeff Janice I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.610 
is right now the way Jeff Janice I
thought<00:02:54.150> again<00:02:54.450> made<00:02:54.690> some<00:02:54.930> plays<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.530> know

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thought again made some plays you know

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.870 
thought again made some plays you know
throughout<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> course<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.160> day<00:02:56.280> he's<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
throughout the course a day he's the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120 
throughout the course a day he's the
number<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.390> think<00:02:57.750> yeah<00:02:58.110> Jamie<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.920> gunner

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
number one I think yeah Jamie the gunner

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
number one I think yeah Jamie the gunner
on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.370> on<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.610> punt<00:02:59.970> team<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:00.600> well

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
on the on the punt team in there as well

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.910 
on the on the punt team in there as well
so<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.959> mean<00:03:01.110> there's<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.320> lot<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.470> things<00:03:01.770> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
so I mean there's a lot of things that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.900 
so I mean there's a lot of things that
he's<00:03:02.040> doing<00:03:02.160> from<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.430> special<00:03:02.760> teams

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
he's doing from a special teams

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.910 
he's doing from a special teams
perspective<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.930> maybe<00:03:04.110> make<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.500> next<00:03:04.650> jump

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
perspective to maybe make that next jump

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.050 
perspective to maybe make that next jump
that<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.130> Packers<00:03:05.430> were<00:03:05.520> looking<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.030> far

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
that the Packers were looking for as far

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.510 
that the Packers were looking for as far
as<00:03:06.300> more<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> complete<00:03:06.989> reserve<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.310> that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
as more of a complete reserve so if that

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.400 
as more of a complete reserve so if that
happens<00:03:08.970> that's<00:03:09.209> more<00:03:09.600> time<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.989> Epidaurus

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
happens that's more time that Epidaurus

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.960 
happens that's more time that Epidaurus
is<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.830> make<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:10.980> we<00:03:11.520> saw<00:03:11.730> today

tretter worked there a little bit in Don
Barclay<00:03:43.440> Barclays<00:03:43.860> still<00:03:44.100> working<00:03:44.430> number

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
Barclay Barclays still working number

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.820 
Barclay Barclays still working number
two's<00:03:44.820> with<00:03:45.000> every<00:03:45.239> right<00:03:45.360> tackle<00:03:45.840> Treader

they<00:03:47.040> want<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.310> see<00:03:47.580> what<00:03:47.730> he<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.150> mean<00:03:48.480> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
they want to see what he can do I mean I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.390 
they want to see what he can do I mean I
think<00:03:48.900> he<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.410> be<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> pretty<00:03:49.739> decent<00:03:50.130> Center

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
think he can be a pretty decent Center

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.370 
think he can be a pretty decent Center
the<00:03:50.910> other<00:03:51.090> spots<00:03:51.540> I'm<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.080> bit<00:03:52.200> more

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
the other spots I'm a little bit more

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.410 
the other spots I'm a little bit more
wary<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.070> as<00:03:53.340> far<00:03:53.519> as<00:03:53.640> just<00:03:53.850> his<00:03:53.970> strength<00:03:54.269> and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
wary of as far as just his strength and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
wary of as far as just his strength and
where<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:54.989> all<00:03:55.380> those<00:03:55.500> things<00:03:55.560> fit<00:03:55.950> in

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
where you know all those things fit in

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.229 
where you know all those things fit in
line<00:03:56.130> but<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.340> think<00:03:56.549> he<00:03:56.610> certainly<00:03:56.910> has<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
line but I think he certainly has the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.270 
line but I think he certainly has the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
athleticism and it has what it takes to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.039 
athleticism and it has what it takes to
compete<00:03:59.489> at<00:03:59.610> this<00:03:59.670> level<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.510> thing<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.750> those
