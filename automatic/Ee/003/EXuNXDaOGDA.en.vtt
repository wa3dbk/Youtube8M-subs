on<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:28.199> unsuspecting<00:00:28.949> enemy<00:00:29.460> base<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
on this unsuspecting enemy base here and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
on this unsuspecting enemy base here and
it's<00:00:32.250> got<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> decent<00:00:32.759> amount<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.300> resources

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it's got a decent amount of resources

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.209 
it's got a decent amount of resources
hundred<00:00:34.170> thousand<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:34.950> i<00:00:35.040> would

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
hundred thousand i don't think i would

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
hundred thousand i don't think i would
have<00:00:35.250> went<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:36.630> worth<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.290> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
have went for it not really worth it in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.799 
have went for it not really worth it in
my<00:00:37.440> opinion<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.969> mention<00:00:39.239> he's<00:00:39.360> using<00:00:39.690> air

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
my opinion not to mention he's using air

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
my opinion not to mention he's using air
units<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> expensive<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
units which can be kind of expensive I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.080 
units which can be kind of expensive I
mean<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:43.200> now<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.890> base<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
mean as of now the base is kind of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.369 
mean as of now the base is kind of
defending<00:00:45.450> itself<00:00:45.660> pretty<00:00:45.840> well<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
defending itself pretty well with the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
defending itself pretty well with the
air<00:00:46.620> minds<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.250> their<00:00:47.399> defense<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.149> their

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
air minds and their defense but their

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.010 
air minds and their defense but their
defense<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.649> blow<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.960> there<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
defense is about to blow up and there it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.279 
defense is about to blow up and there it
goes<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.969> don't<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:54.989> about

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
goes so I don't know what to think about

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
goes so I don't know what to think about
this<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.860> never<00:00:56.370> thought<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.940> sort<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this I just never thought this sort of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.029 
this I just never thought this sort of
strategy<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.840> work<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.350> I've<00:00:58.440> never<00:00:58.649> tried

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
strategy would work so I've never tried

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
strategy would work so I've never tried
it<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.550> by<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> looks<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> oh

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
bob has chosen a perfect placement of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.740 
bob has chosen a perfect placement of
his<00:01:36.299> troops<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.920> i'm<00:01:38.759> gonna<00:01:38.880> speed<00:01:39.270> things<00:01:39.540> up

his troops and i'm gonna speed things up

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.149 
his troops and i'm gonna speed things up
because<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.320> starting<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.799> kind<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
because it's starting to get kind of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.090 
because it's starting to get kind of
boring<00:01:41.990> eighty-two<00:01:42.990> percent<00:01:43.100> eighty-four

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
boring eighty-two percent eighty-four

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.899 
boring eighty-two percent eighty-four
percent<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:46.369> that's<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> one<00:01:47.700> advantage

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
percent and that's the one advantage

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.550 
percent and that's the one advantage
though<00:01:48.360> cannons<00:01:48.869> can't<00:01:49.079> shoot<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
though cannons can't shoot at it and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.499 
though cannons can't shoot at it and
done<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:53.340> did<00:01:53.640> bring<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> barbarian

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

done now he did bring out the barbarian
king<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> end<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> really

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
king at the end but that really

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.550 
king at the end but that really
shouldn't<00:01:55.829> count<00:01:56.070> okay<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.520> five<00:01:56.909> dragons

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
shouldn't count okay so five dragons

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.390 
did not know that reflector can do audio
now<00:03:13.959> because<00:03:14.349> it<00:03:14.500> used<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.739> not<00:03:14.769> do<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.190> night

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
now because it used to not do that night

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.089

I would have to add in myself but i

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.860
