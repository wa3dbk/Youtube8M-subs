00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.699 

I'm<00:04:19.370> drunk<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:20.419> I've<00:04:20.510> navigated<00:04:20.959> myself

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
I'm drunk and so I've navigated myself

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
into a corner but it should be really

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.140 
into a corner but it should be really
easy<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.660> get<00:04:23.810> out<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.320> that's<00:04:24.889> not<00:04:25.150> possible

easy to get out and that's not possible
here<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.690> becomes<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:27.139> sort<00:04:27.440> of
