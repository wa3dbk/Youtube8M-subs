00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
okay when I had only one gigabyte of RAM

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.120 
okay when I had only one gigabyte of RAM
this<00:01:20.390> machine<00:01:21.159> it<00:01:22.159> used<00:01:22.759> about<00:01:23.030> 50%<00:01:23.929> 50<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.859> 60

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
this machine it used about 50% 50 to 60

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.249 
this machine it used about 50% 50 to 60
percent<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> RAM<00:01:26.259> no<00:01:27.819> two<00:01:28.819> gigabytes
