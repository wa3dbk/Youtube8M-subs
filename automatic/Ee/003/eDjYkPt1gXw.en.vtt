2014 renegade now the reason and purpose

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.110 
2014 renegade now the reason and purpose
I<00:00:10.080> believe<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.130> renegade<00:00:11.519> over<00:00:11.940> all

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
I believe for the renegade over all

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.200 
I believe for the renegade over all
these<00:00:12.330> years<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.650> more<00:00:13.950> surf<00:00:14.460> Pacific

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
these years is to be more surf Pacific

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.599 
these years is to be more surf Pacific
now<00:00:15.420> what<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.020> mean<00:00:16.289> by<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.980> allowing<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
now what I mean by that is allowing the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.160 
now what I mean by that is allowing the
harness<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.180> doesn't<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> whole<00:00:18.960> lot<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
harness it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.679 
harness it doesn't have a whole lot of
molding<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.070> here<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.910> allows<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.480> to

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
molding in here and it allows this to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
molding in here and it allows this to
turn<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> has<00:00:22.439> more<00:00:22.740> neoprene<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.760> it's

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
turn on you has more neoprene to it it's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.640 
turn on you has more neoprene to it it's
a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.510> bit<00:00:24.630> lighter<00:00:24.900> harness<00:00:25.380> than<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
a little bit lighter harness than the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
a little bit lighter harness than the
pyro<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.250> sure<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.910> they've<00:00:27.060> done<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.660> lot

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
pyro for sure but they've done a lot

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.290 
pyro for sure but they've done a lot
more<00:00:28.439> structural<00:00:29.220> work<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.000> renegade

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
more structural work on this renegade

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659 
more structural work on this renegade
the<00:00:30.869> renegade<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the renegade now you can see that

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
the renegade now you can see that
they're<00:00:32.940> pre-curved<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> something

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
they're pre-curved this is something

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
they're pre-curved this is something
that<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:34.800> had<00:00:35.010> been<00:00:35.100> working<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that the kind had been working on in the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
that the kind had been working on in the
past<00:00:36.360> couple<00:00:36.660> years<00:00:36.899> has<00:00:37.290> definitely<00:00:37.890> set

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
past couple years has definitely set

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
past couple years has definitely set
them<00:00:38.250> apart<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> harness

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
them apart from a lot of harness

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.660 
them apart from a lot of harness
manufacturers<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> other<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
manufacturers now the other thing that I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
manufacturers now the other thing that I
like<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.950> have

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like what the kind has done if you have

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.580 
like what the kind has done if you have
to<00:00:44.160> understand<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.789> harnesses<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.140> make

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to understand is harnesses if you make

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.529 
to understand is harnesses if you make
them<00:00:46.890> flat<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.550> makes<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> easy<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> make

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
them flat which makes it easy to make

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
them flat which makes it easy to make
then<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.320> structure<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.670> doesn't

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
then your structure like this it doesn't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
then your structure like this it doesn't
want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.329> set<00:00:51.510> flat<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> pre<00:00:52.710> curve

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
want to set flat it's got a pre curve

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
want to set flat it's got a pre curve
it's<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.370> pre<00:00:53.670> shaping<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> can

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it's got pre shaping to it and you can

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.689 
it's got pre shaping to it and you can
see<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.590> instead<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.190> sewing<00:00:56.489> one

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
see here instead of just sewing one

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
see here instead of just sewing one
piece<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.300> neoprene<00:00:57.809> across<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
piece of neoprene across here and it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
piece of neoprene across here and it
takes<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> does<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.510> turn

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
takes and what it does is when you turn

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
takes and what it does is when you turn
it<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.289> causes<00:01:01.710> wrinkles<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.850> in

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it it causes wrinkles all in here in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
it it causes wrinkles all in here in
that<00:01:03.000> material<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.989> over<00:01:04.229> stresses<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that material we're over stresses it the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
that material we're over stresses it the
kind<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.760> pieced<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.810> telling<00:01:07.350> getting

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
kind has pieced this out telling getting

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
kind has pieced this out telling getting
the<00:01:07.650> shaping<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> kite<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the shaping and a kite they get the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.929 
the shaping and a kite they get the
shaping<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> neoprene<00:01:10.790> fantastic<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
shaping in this neoprene fantastic it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
shaping in this neoprene fantastic it
turns<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.510> harness<00:01:12.810> instead<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> one<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
turns this harness instead of one of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
turns this harness instead of one of
their<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.520> beloved<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.810> step<00:01:16.110> below

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
their little beloved just one step below

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.950 
their little beloved just one step below
the<00:01:16.560> pyro<00:01:16.830> harness<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> really

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the pyro harness this one is really

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
the pyro harness this one is really
really<00:01:19.320> nice<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.130> they've<00:01:20.310> lightened<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
really nice now they've lightened it up

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.039 
really nice now they've lightened it up
the<00:01:21.210> material<00:01:21.930> wise<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.799> screening<00:01:23.340> here

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
the material wise I put screening here

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.270 
the material wise I put screening here
this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> things<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.009> tell

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this is one of the things that they tell

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
this is one of the things that they tell
us<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.630> lightness<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
us and as for lightness I think it is a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
us and as for lightness I think it is a
little<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.729> again<00:01:30.180> they've<00:01:30.450> increased

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
little bit but again they've increased

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
little bit but again they've increased
the<00:01:31.079> shaping<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.130> am<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.670> looking

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the shaping on there but am I looking

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
the shaping on there but am I looking
for<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> lightweight<00:01:33.450> harness<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
for the lightweight harness not when I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 
for the lightweight harness not when I
come<00:01:35.430> into<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.060> good<00:01:36.210> cushion<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.840> good

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
come into one the good cushion and good

has the knife on the side not underneath
and<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.720> good<00:02:05.960> shaping<00:02:06.530> here<00:02:06.710> reason<00:02:07.640> I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and it's a good shaping here reason I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.180 
and it's a good shaping here reason I
like<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.510> when<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.960> does<00:02:09.260> roll<00:02:09.649> there's

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
like that is when this does roll there's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.850 
like that is when this does roll there's
no<00:02:10.430> sharp<00:02:10.760> lip<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.300> each<00:02:11.480> side<00:02:11.840> here<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.590> kind

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
no sharp lip on each side here this kind

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.230 
no sharp lip on each side here this kind
of<00:02:12.890> gets<00:02:13.070> into<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.400> shaping<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> right<00:02:14.060> where

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
of gets into that shaping of right where

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.640 
of gets into that shaping of right where
your<00:02:14.360> stomach<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.870> when<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.170> bar<00:02:15.380> does

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
your stomach is when that bar does

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.280 
your stomach is when that bar does
rotate<00:02:15.950> which<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.490> will<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:17.300> when<00:02:18.050> this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
rotate which it will now when this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
rotate which it will now when this
lashes<00:02:18.740> together<00:02:18.860> they<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.610> changed<00:02:20.090> itself

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
lashes together they have changed itself

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.840 
lashes together they have changed itself
a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.960> bit<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.710> want<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.130> be<00:02:22.220> pretty

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
a little bit so you want to be pretty

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.240 
a little bit so you want to be pretty
good<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.150> size<00:02:23.390> specific<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.530> but<00:02:25.100> you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
good in size specific on this but you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.540 
good in size specific on this but you
latch<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.980> then<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.070> pull<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.280> power

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
latch this in then you pull the power

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.570 
latch this in then you pull the power
belt<00:02:28.910> over<00:02:29.470> now<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.650> gives<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.070> good<00:02:31.310> grip

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
belt over now that gives you a good grip

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.760 
belt over now that gives you a good grip
in<00:02:31.610> here<00:02:31.970> not<00:02:32.420> near<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:32.840> tight<00:02:33.080> as<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.440> full

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
in here not near as tight as the full

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.830 
in here not near as tight as the full
power<00:02:34.160> belt<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.850> pyro<00:02:35.090> does<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:35.720> that's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
power belt that the pyro does but that's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690 
power belt that the pyro does but that's
one<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> little<00:02:36.380> differences<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.340> if

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
one of the little differences here is if

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.520 
one of the little differences here is if
you<00:02:37.820> want<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.060> change<00:02:38.240> pricing<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.200> once<00:02:39.410> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you want to change pricing but once you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
you want to change pricing but once you
tighten<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.950> down<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.550> gives<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.970> really

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
tighten it down it gives you a really

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.120 
tighten it down it gives you a really
good<00:02:41.780> grip<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.440> printing<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:42.950> they<00:02:43.070> do

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
good grip and that printing that they do

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.280 
good grip and that printing that they do
on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.430> inside<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.390> feel<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:44.750> causing<00:02:45.200> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
on the inside I can feel that causing a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.330 
on the inside I can feel that causing a
little<00:02:45.500> grip<00:02:45.680> as<00:02:45.860> well

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
little grip as well

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.610 
little grip as well
so<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:46.820> hooking<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.660> they<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.290> one

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
so now hooking this in they have one

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.830 
so now hooking this in they have one
clip<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.070> one<00:02:49.280> side<00:02:49.490> this<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.850> new<00:02:50.120> lock<00:02:50.480> clip

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
clip on one side this is a new lock clip

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.590 
clip on one side this is a new lock clip
that<00:02:51.020> they<00:02:51.140> have<00:02:51.350> posi<00:02:52.010> pause<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.940> lot<00:02:53.120> clip<00:02:53.450> I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that they have posi pause a lot clip I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.180 
that they have posi pause a lot clip I
believe<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.110> they're<00:02:54.230> calling<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.709> so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
believe is what they're calling it so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.180 
believe is what they're calling it so
hooking<00:02:55.910> in<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.390> pre<00:02:57.080> adjusted<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.740> side<00:02:58.010> you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
hooking in I pre adjusted this side you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.780 
hooking in I pre adjusted this side you
can<00:02:58.340> see<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.910> really<00:02:59.270> like<00:02:59.810> how<00:02:59.990> they<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.320> this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
can see I really like how they have this

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
can see I really like how they have this
elastic<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:01.970> which<00:03:02.120> hides<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.510> straps

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
elastic here which hides the straps

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.410 
elastic here which hides the straps
under<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.680> keeps<00:03:03.890> things<00:03:04.070> real<00:03:04.489> clean<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.030> did

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
under and keeps things real clean I did

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.180 
under and keeps things real clean I did
not<00:03:05.630> undo<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.080> side<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.739> see<00:03:06.950> it's

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
not undo this side so you can see it's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.190 
not undo this side so you can see it's
really<00:03:07.580> nice<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.940> smooth<00:03:08.330> there's<00:03:08.989> your
