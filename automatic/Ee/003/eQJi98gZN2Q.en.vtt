00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.779
 new informative in corner steve good 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.510
 I introduce myself I'm Steve I'm the animator 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.490
 of corner steve and corner steve james in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.580
 this moment I am going to talk about a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 topic that many of us have been 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.670
 waiting more than three years ago the subject 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 of x 13 and goku versus mario bros or the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.019
 revenge or have revenge as they say 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 theme that a long time ago my friend 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 diego or x of 13 started doing this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989
 flash image series like us 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
 we are seeing here on screen this was 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 a series that lasted from 1 to 5 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.820
 parties but lately I was from 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.670
 part 1 and part 2 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.530
 3 4 and 5 did not exist yet and all 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 they asked what happened even I there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.900
 rumors that he was dead and thing that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 It's not like that I have to clarify that x out of 13 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.040
 be my compadre live is fine but what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.080
 important of this news is that 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.210
 conversing with diego we have reached the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.060
 conclusion that the third part of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 goku myanmar euros if you are going to get to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.619
 is already working on it already 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.110
 that is, we ask you to be patients who 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.350
 stop sending so many questions that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.180
 when it's going to come out that when there's some 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.259
 people who start insulting suddenly 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.479
 in the channel we already ask you to please 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.970
 stop this a little bit and have a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.420
 little patience because soon 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.039
 is going to be ready your new video the other 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 what many of you wanted to tell them 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.440
 they ask Diego almost teach him to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 do videos like he does he good I'll 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.560
 I have something for you I offer 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.300
 that they go through my channel from time to time 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.920
 when I also do tutorials 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.010
 I'm also an animator 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.290
 known as diego 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.150
 I'm an animator and I do tutorials and I go 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.650
 to start using flash to make your 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.130
 own videos as good as they are 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.330
 because I say already and that is not worth it is compadre 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.210
 Diego is working on his new 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.310
 project so I read you tell them that by 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.030
 please have patience that is already coming 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.740
 well and I hope not simply and it's a 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 time is a power is a hug there to everything 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.270
 the world not to the entire channel to everything 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.260
