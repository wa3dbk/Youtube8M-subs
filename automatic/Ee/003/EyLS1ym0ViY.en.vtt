fairly<00:01:18.960> magic<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.009> getting<00:01:20.159> them

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490

but<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.450> definitely<00:01:24.689> ways<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.560> mix<00:01:25.950> up

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but there are definitely ways to mix up

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.740 
but there are definitely ways to mix up
your<00:01:26.250> falcon<00:01:26.700> punches<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.210> jump<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> air
