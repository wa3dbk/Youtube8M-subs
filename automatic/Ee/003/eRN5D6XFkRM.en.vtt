00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.469
 Maritime-led coalition forces continue to negotiate peace along the Iraqi / Iranian border to restore stability to the region. 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.599
 - What the hell are we stopping for? - Because we're in place. 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.180
 I guess we'll have a party. 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.630
 - Where's the DLT (mission information table)? - Right in front of you. - Thanks buddy. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.109
 Have you ever asked yourself why this part of the world is still so fucked up? 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.379
 I'm just working here, Dave. 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.959
 They conducted an investigation to find a stash for chemical weapons, in the "eight-zero" area. 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.970
 You are currently the only unit I can send there. 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.039
 Jackson's last known position is around the meat market. And that's really a fucking bad part of town! 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.569
 Movement. 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.395
 Make sure you have the correct ID before continuing. 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.999
 Possible goals. 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.619
 Someone should tell DOD to stay away from those ammunition depots. 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.679
 This is an earthquake, boys. We're about 90km from the main fault line. 

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.379
 I have no signal, I don't like it fucking. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.479
 God! Sniper! 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.379
 I throw smoke! (Smoke Grenade) 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.520
 - Where the fuck? - Approaching. 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.739
 - Enemy overlook. - Stay, move! 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.379
 I'm getting away for eleven o'clock! 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.379
 They're here! 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.679
 Get the fuck off! 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.989
 Report now! 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.379
 - I'm fine! - I'm fine! - I'm fine! - I'm fucked but cool! 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.479
 RPG on my twelve o'clock! Second floor! 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.379
 Stay away from that fucking car! 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.879
 The unit moved to the roof to remove the snipers. 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.779
 If the information is up to date, the sniper is still there. Be careful there. 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.670
 - Clean. - Clean. 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.479
 Let's go this way. 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.679
 Shit! Contact! 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.899
 - Does anyone see him? - I do not see him. 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.279
 Dude, it's a fucking fifty. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.399
 - Stay on the ground. - Stay on the ground. 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.279
 Slow down. I think he's in the hotel. 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.379
 Let's go, from cover to cover. 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.079
 - We're luring him out. - All right. 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.279
 - I'm moving. - I'm moving. - I go. 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.279
 - Now. - I'm moving. - I go. 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.679
 She's already fucking dead now. 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.279
 We crawl into the corner, wait until he pushes his head out and then fuck him off. 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.879
 Until tomorrow. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.079
 Black, we have to get in position, don't push your head and move! 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.279
 Black, now! 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.279
 There's the sniper. 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.479
 All right, all right, across the street. 50 meters, in the middle, is in hiding. 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.579
 I have AT4 here. 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.479
 Give it to Black. Shit, cover is getting nothing. 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.379
 Shoot as best you can. 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.079
 I'll cover you and you'll take him! 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.779
 Watch your recoil. 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.979
 Hold on. 3,2,1 - covering fire! 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.479
 The unit located the missing patrol and noticed the suspicious wire leading to the nearby dungeon. They estimate the explosive, Sergeant Black is asked to follow him ... 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.379
 Are you holding up? 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.479
 It was just another damn shock, nothing to worry about. One force met the other. 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.499
 Just cut that wire! 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.879
 *You swine* 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.579
 Black, we're getting ass! Come up behind us now! 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.375
 1-3, here's 5-0. I have your position and goals. 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:23.179
 Go to the wall and take LMG to Black. 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.379
 Jesus, they're all around us. Where is Litte Bird. 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.979
 - An enemy vehicle coming from the north. - Bach ... 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.779
