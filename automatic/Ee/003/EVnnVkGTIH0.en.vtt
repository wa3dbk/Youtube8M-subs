out when you're running or walking just

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.410 
out when you're running or walking just
after<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.920> foot<00:00:17.100> hits<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> ground<00:00:17.430> it's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
after your foot hits the ground it's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.060 
after your foot hits the ground it's
quite<00:00:18.660> normal<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.830> foots

you're<00:00:27.269> an<00:00:27.359> under<00:00:27.689> pronator<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.529> somewhere

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you're an under pronator and somewhere

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.740 
you're an under pronator and somewhere
in<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> middle<00:00:29.820> that's<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> neutral

in the middle that's just a neutral
pronation<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> why<00:00:32.489> does<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.700> matter

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840

pronation so why does it matter
pronation<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.170> increase<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.620> chance<00:00:34.860> of

just foot knee angle and hip injury

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.760 
just foot knee angle and hip injury

more pronation contrary to popular
belief<00:01:20.400> pronation<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> good

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
belief pronation is actually a good

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
belief pronation is actually a good
thing<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> arch<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.549> foot<00:01:23.790> rolls

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
thing when the arch of your foot rolls

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
thing when the arch of your foot rolls
in<00:01:24.330> words<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.750> pronates<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.619> absorbs<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in words or pronates it absorbs the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.569 
in words or pronates it absorbs the
shock<00:01:26.420> taking<00:01:27.420> strain<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.810> knee<00:01:28.140> ankle

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
shock taking strain off your knee ankle

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.330 
shock taking strain off your knee ankle
etc<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.900> need<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> shoe<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> offers
