787<00:00:21.580> when<00:00:21.880> we<00:00:22.000> were<00:00:22.090> looking<00:00:22.420> at<00:00:22.540> what's<00:00:22.900> the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
787 when we were looking at what's the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.840 
787 when we were looking at what's the
right<00:00:23.200> material<00:00:23.740> for<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.010> airplane<00:00:24.490> we

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
right material for the airplane we

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.609 
right material for the airplane we
looked<00:00:25.060> at<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.240> cost<00:00:25.540> to<00:00:25.720> manufacture<00:00:26.020> we

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
looked at the cost to manufacture we

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.050 
looked at the cost to manufacture we
looked<00:00:26.800> at<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.980> benefits<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.460> the<00:00:27.550> material

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
looked at the benefits of the material

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.480 
looked at the benefits of the material
and<00:00:28.270> we<00:00:28.869> made<00:00:29.050> this<00:00:29.200> decision<00:00:29.590> to<00:00:30.010> build<00:00:30.340> the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
and we made this decision to build the

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.400 
and we made this decision to build the
first<00:00:30.700> commercial<00:00:31.300> composite<00:00:31.840> airplane<00:00:32.200> we

first commercial composite airplane we

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.710 
first commercial composite airplane we
were<00:00:32.500> very<00:00:32.560> focused<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.690> commonality<00:00:34.690> between

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
with the 787 we decided let's do

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.480 
with the 787 we decided let's do
something<00:01:05.440> different<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.920> that<00:01:06.070> was<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.369> go

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
something different and that was to go

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.800 
something different and that was to go
to<00:01:06.520> what<00:01:06.820> we<00:01:06.880> call<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.090> more<00:01:07.330> electric

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and over again we can actually repair it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.280 
and over again we can actually repair it
just<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> would<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.480> metal<00:02:35.930> or<00:02:36.050> aluminum

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.619 
just like you would a metal or aluminum
airplane<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.640> can<00:02:37.790> also<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> composite

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
airplane but you can also do a composite

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.449 
airplane but you can also do a composite
repair<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> airline's<00:02:39.830> actually<00:02:40.280> have

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
repair so the airline's actually have

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.190 
repair so the airline's actually have
more<00:02:40.700> options<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:41.360> chose<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.019> right

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
more options and we chose the right

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.589 
more options and we chose the right
material<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.099> right<00:02:43.280> application

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
carbon fiber allows us to put those

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.440 
carbon fiber allows us to put those
larger<00:02:46.400> windows<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.209> all<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
larger windows in so that all the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.119 
larger windows in so that all the
passengers<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:48.500> out<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.799> windows

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
passengers can see out the windows

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.100 
passengers can see out the windows
without<00:02:49.580> adding<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.330> lot<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.629> weight<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
without adding a lot of weight to the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.289 
without adding a lot of weight to the
airplane<00:02:51.530> one<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.190> primary<00:02:52.400> goals<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.269> the

airplane one of the primary goals on the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.150 
airplane one of the primary goals on the
program<00:02:53.780> was<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.319> use<00:02:54.560> all<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.040> this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
program was to use all of this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.520 
program was to use all of this
technology<00:02:55.579> to<00:02:55.880> reduce<00:02:56.269> fuel<00:02:56.750> burn<00:02:56.959> reduce

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
technology to reduce fuel burn reduce

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.830 
technology to reduce fuel burn reduce
emissions<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.610> make<00:02:58.940> an<00:02:59.060> airplane<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.569> really

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
emissions and make an airplane is really

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.720 
emissions and make an airplane is really
good<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.470> environment<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
good for the environment and this is the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.819 
good for the environment and this is the
first<00:03:01.760> time<00:03:02.120> we've<00:03:02.299> also<00:03:02.480> said<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.590> what's

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
first time we've also said but what's

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.589 
first time we've also said but what's
going<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.160> make<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> pilot<00:03:04.760> feel<00:03:04.940> good<00:03:05.299> what's

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
going to make a pilot feel good what's

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.059 
going to make a pilot feel good what's
going<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.900> it's<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.530> make<00:03:06.680> them<00:03:06.769> want<00:03:07.010> to

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
going to it's going to make them want to

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.710 
going to it's going to make them want to
come<00:03:07.129> into<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:07.670> content<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.239> fly<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
come into that content and fly that
