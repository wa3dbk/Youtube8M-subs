exclusively<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> i<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
exclusively and i think it's a really

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.549 
exclusively and i think it's a really
important<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.360> say<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.289> think<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
important thing to say because i think a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.720 
important thing to say because i think a

hard time about it and I think you have

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
hard time about it and I think you have

we're going in to transfer our eggs and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
we're going in to transfer our eggs and
I<00:01:15.720> realized<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.350> quickly<00:01:16.670> not<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> share<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I realized very quickly not to share and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
I realized very quickly not to share and
just<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> keep<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> between<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.950> husband

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
just to keep it between me my husband

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.399 
just to keep it between me my husband
because<00:01:20.549> otherwise<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.840> were<00:01:21.930> living<00:01:22.140> those

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
because otherwise we were living those

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929 
because otherwise we were living those
highs<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> lows<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.460> everybody<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.880> our

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
highs and lows with everybody in our

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.820 
highs and lows with everybody in our
family<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.229> because<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.650> already

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
family and I think because we already

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
family and I think because we already
had<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> child<00:01:27.229> everybody<00:01:28.229> we're<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.439> excited

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
had a child everybody we're so excited

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.260 
had a child everybody we're so excited
to<00:01:28.829> maybe<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.460> another<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> family

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to maybe have another one in the family

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.210 
to maybe have another one in the family
and<00:01:30.650> say<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.400> lows<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> lot<00:01:33.090> lower

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
and say it's the lows are a lot lower

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.260 
and say it's the lows are a lot lower
the<00:01:35.220> only<00:01:35.670> thing<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.119> to

the only thing that you have to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
the only thing that you have to
understand<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.710> your
