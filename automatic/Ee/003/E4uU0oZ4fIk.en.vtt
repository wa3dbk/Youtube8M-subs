4 i pretty much only kept it for the
multiplayer<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> funny

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
multiplayer which is kind of funny

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
multiplayer which is kind of funny
because<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> exact<00:00:53.760> opposite<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.600> i

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
because it was the exact opposite but i

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.330 
because it was the exact opposite but i
think<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> reason<00:00:54.930> why<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.649> many<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:55.860> are

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
think the reason why so many people are

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.819 
think the reason why so many people are
