00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
anything more than that so I would say

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
anything more than that so I would say
things<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:33.500> graphic<00:02:34.040> design<00:02:34.270> photo<00:02:35.270> editing

writing really long documents such as

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
writing really long documents such as
magazine<00:02:42.140> articles<00:02:42.740> or<00:02:43.130> maybe<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.120> short

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330

book<00:02:44.690> then<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:46.310> don't<00:02:46.520> think<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
book then I really don't think the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.770 
book then I really don't think the
tablet<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.290> ideal<00:02:48.770> device<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:50.300> tablet<00:02:50.690> is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
tablet is the ideal device the tablet is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.810 
tablet is the ideal device the tablet is
more<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> consumption<00:02:51.709> device<00:02:51.830> with<00:02:52.520> some

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
more of a consumption device with some

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.590 
more of a consumption device with some
creation<00:02:53.380> thrown<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.560> alongside<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:55.400> laptop<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
creation thrown in alongside a laptop I

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.170 
creation thrown in alongside a laptop I
would<00:02:56.900> say<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.160> creation<00:02:58.850> device

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
would say is more of a creation device

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.340 
would say is more of a creation device
also<00:03:00.100> usable<00:03:01.100> for<00:03:01.570> content<00:03:02.570> consumption<00:03:02.959> as
