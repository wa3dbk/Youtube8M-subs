00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.950 

ok<00:00:09.460> this<00:00:09.580> is<00:00:09.760> the<00:00:09.790> rear<00:00:10.420> panel<00:00:10.720> take<00:00:11.559> one<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
ok this is the rear panel take one the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.290 
ok this is the rear panel take one the
fabrication<00:00:17.740> of<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.980> rear<00:00:18.160> panel<00:00:18.430> is<00:00:18.820> is

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
fabrication of the rear panel is is

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.109 
fabrication of the rear panel is is
actually<00:00:19.689> quite<00:00:19.840> easy<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:21.340> start<00:00:21.700> with<00:00:22.090> a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
actually quite easy we start with a

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.040 
actually quite easy we start with a
piece<00:00:22.480> of<00:00:22.690> ply<00:00:23.260> board<00:00:23.590> which<00:00:24.520> is<00:00:24.820> four<00:00:25.539> feet<00:00:25.750> by

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
piece of ply board which is four feet by

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.529 
piece of ply board which is four feet by
two<00:00:26.110> feet<00:00:26.380> so<00:00:26.949> if<00:00:27.160> you're<00:00:27.580> actually<00:00:27.730> using<00:00:27.970> a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
two feet so if you're actually using a

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.029 
two feet so if you're actually using a
four<00:00:28.750> foot<00:00:28.900> by<00:00:29.050> two<00:00:29.109> foot<00:00:29.289> board<00:00:29.680> then<00:00:29.949> you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
four foot by two foot board then you

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.070 
four foot by two foot board then you
don't<00:00:30.220> have<00:00:30.250> to<00:00:30.400> do<00:00:30.520> anything<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:31.060> it<00:00:31.210> clearly

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
don't have to do anything to it clearly

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.780 
don't have to do anything to it clearly
you<00:00:32.290> need<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.559> cut<00:00:32.770> if<00:00:32.949> you're<00:00:33.129> coming<00:00:33.309> cutting

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
you need to cut if you're coming cutting

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.060 
you need to cut if you're coming cutting
from<00:00:33.940> an<00:00:34.059> 804<00:00:34.600> sheet

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.610 

on<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.790> inside<00:00:37.940> we<00:00:38.540> have<00:00:40.600> placed<00:00:41.600> our<00:00:41.900> battles

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.110 

the<00:00:45.620> top<00:00:45.860> one<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.840> middle<00:00:48.200> one<00:00:48.230> here<00:00:48.650> and<00:00:49.120> this

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
the top one the middle one here and this

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840 
the top one the middle one here and this
vertical<00:00:50.780> one<00:00:50.930> in<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.200> middle<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:52.370> will<00:00:52.640> be

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
vertical one in the middle that will be

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.950 
vertical one in the middle that will be
to<00:00:53.300> support<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:54.850> fireproof<00:00:55.850> board<00:00:56.239> cladding

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
to support the fireproof board cladding

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.720 
to support the fireproof board cladding
that<00:00:57.470> we're<00:00:57.650> going<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.890> put<00:00:58.040> on<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.370> internal

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
that we're going to put on the internal

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.869 
that we're going to put on the internal
side<00:00:59.650> also<00:01:00.650> on<00:01:00.800> this<00:01:00.980> horizontal<00:01:01.699> one

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
side also on this horizontal one

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.760 
side also on this horizontal one
underneath<00:01:02.360> we<00:01:03.260> will<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.620> screwing<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:05.770> smoke

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
underneath we will be screwing the smoke

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.560 
underneath we will be screwing the smoke
spreader<00:01:07.160> which<00:01:07.520> again<00:01:07.820> will<00:01:08.000> be<00:01:08.150> made<00:01:08.330> out<00:01:08.360> of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
spreader which again will be made out of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.710 
spreader which again will be made out of
the<00:01:08.840> fireproof<00:01:09.350> board<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:10.390> then<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.509> final

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
the fireproof board and then the final

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.529 
the fireproof board and then the final
one<00:01:11.960> here<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:13.039> central<00:01:13.520> support<00:01:13.940> for<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
one here is a central support for the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.870 
one here is a central support for the
the<00:01:14.810> lower<00:01:15.080> piece<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.619> cladding<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.759> will

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the lower piece of cladding now it will

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.660 
the lower piece of cladding now it will
become<00:01:17.180> clear<00:01:17.570> as<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:18.340> move<00:01:19.340> into<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
become clear as we move into the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.340 
become clear as we move into the
assembly<00:01:20.210> process<00:01:20.380> why<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.710> don't<00:01:21.950> need

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
assembly process why we don't need

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.580 
assembly process why we don't need
battles<00:01:24.350> down<00:01:24.860> either<00:01:25.160> side<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:27.350> board

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
battles down either side of the board

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.870 
battles down either side of the board
you<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.399> see<00:01:28.610> we've<00:01:28.820> drilled<00:01:29.060> holes<00:01:30.130> but<00:01:31.130> when

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can see we've drilled holes but when

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880 
you can see we've drilled holes but when
we<00:01:32.060> actually<00:01:32.330> come<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.960> assembling<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.649> with

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
we actually come to assembling it with

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.870 
we actually come to assembling it with
the<00:01:34.160> side<00:01:35.289> pieces<00:01:36.289> then<00:01:37.160> you'll<00:01:37.340> see<00:01:37.580> how<00:01:37.610> it

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the side pieces then you'll see how it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.370 
the side pieces then you'll see how it
all<00:01:38.030> fits<00:01:38.330> together<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:38.840> don't<00:01:38.869> worry<00:01:39.229> about

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
all fits together so don't worry about

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.910 
all fits together so don't worry about
that<00:01:39.830> too<00:01:40.700> much<00:01:40.729> at<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.299> stage<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.710> only

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
that too much at this stage the only

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920 
that too much at this stage the only
other<00:01:42.950> thing<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.460> say<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.030> terms<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
other thing to say is in terms of the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.340 
other thing to say is in terms of the
width<00:01:45.229> between<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.850> end<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.720> battle<00:01:47.930> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
width between the end of the battle and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.319 
width between the end of the battle and
the<00:01:49.930> edge<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.680> plywood<00:01:52.159> that<00:01:53.150> is

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
the edge of the plywood that is

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.960 
the edge of the plywood that is
determined<00:01:53.990> by<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.600> amount<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:58.009> room<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
determined by the amount of room you

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.200 
determined by the amount of room you
need<00:01:59.180> for<00:01:59.720> a<00:02:00.079> piece<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.040> ply<00:02:01.600> battle<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
need for a piece of ply battle and the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.690 
need for a piece of ply battle and the
fireproof<00:02:05.210> board<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.960> in<00:02:06.079> essence<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:07.070> unit

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
fireproof board so in essence that unit

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
fireproof board so in essence that unit
will

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
will

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.660 
will
puts<00:02:08.640> together<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.860> similarly<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
puts together there similarly at the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.000 
puts together there similarly at the
bottom<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.750> you've<00:02:13.200> got<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> same<00:02:13.739> thing

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
bottom then you've got the same thing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.800 
bottom then you've got the same thing
but<00:02:14.220> we'll<00:02:14.370> come<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> where<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.630> make

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
but we'll come on to that where we make

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
but we'll come on to that where we make
the<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:18.569> fireproof<00:02:19.230> clubbing<00:02:19.980> which<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.520> what

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the the fireproof clubbing which is what

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240 
the the fireproof clubbing which is what
we're<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.209> next<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.140> we'll<00:02:23.040> come

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
we're going to do next so we'll come

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 
we're going to do next so we'll come
back<00:02:23.459> when<00:02:23.640> we've<00:02:23.819> cloud<00:02:24.060> everything<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
back when we've cloud everything so

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
back when we've cloud everything so
we've<00:02:25.800> made<00:02:25.830> not<00:02:26.190> planning<00:02:26.640> now<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.030> you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
we've made not planning now and as you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.490 
we've made not planning now and as you
can<00:02:27.330> see<00:02:27.360> there<00:02:27.690> isn't<00:02:27.930> actually<00:02:28.080> much

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
can see there isn't actually much

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
can see there isn't actually much
difference<00:02:29.160> between<00:02:29.370> where<00:02:29.849> we<00:02:29.880> were<00:02:30.239> before

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
difference between where we were before

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
difference between where we were before
other<00:02:30.989> than<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:32.000> fireproof<00:02:33.000> board<00:02:33.440> planning

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
other than the fireproof board planning

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.610 
other than the fireproof board planning
for<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.980> upper<00:02:35.370> part<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.360> smoker<00:02:36.900> has

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
for the upper part of the smoker has

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.009 
for the upper part of the smoker has
been<00:02:37.950> attached<00:02:38.420> we<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.630> actually

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
been attached we have actually

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.990 
been attached we have actually
fabricated<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.459> for<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> bottom<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
fabricated the one for the bottom and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.080 
fabricated the one for the bottom and
this<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.180> go<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.739> we<00:02:47.610> won't<00:02:47.819> be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
this will go down here now we won't be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.330 
this will go down here now we won't be
putting<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.810> at<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.260> stage<00:02:49.560> because

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
putting this in at this stage because

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.180 
putting this in at this stage because
this<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.360> has<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.780> go<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.140> after<00:02:52.350> we've

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
this one has to go in after we've

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.970 
this one has to go in after we've
assembled<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.880> sides<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.480> placed<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.709> smoke

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
assembled the sides and placed the smoke

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
assembled the sides and placed the smoke
spreader<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.700> position<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:59.580> that's<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.970> for

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
spreader in position so that's it for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.720 
spreader in position so that's it for
now<00:03:00.299> we<00:03:01.230> can't<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.680> any<00:03:01.830> more<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.459> so

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
now we can't do any more on this so

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.970 
now we can't do any more on this so
we'll<00:03:02.849> put<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.360> one<00:03:03.390> side<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.140> we'll

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
we'll put this to one side and we'll

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.870 
we'll put this to one side and we'll
move<00:03:05.160> ahead<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.940> make<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.660> top
