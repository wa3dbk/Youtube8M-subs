this<00:01:40.569> is<00:01:40.749> it's<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.079> lot<00:01:41.200> more<00:01:41.409> rigid<00:01:42.189> in<00:01:42.369> there<00:01:42.759> I

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
this is it's a lot more rigid in there I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.899 
this is it's a lot more rigid in there I
think<00:01:43.929> it'll<00:01:44.319> do<00:01:44.859> the<00:01:45.069> job<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.310> lot<00:01:45.460> better

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
however I have made one there is there

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.289 
however I have made one there is there
out<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.810> point<00:01:50.020> six<00:01:50.170> mil<00:01:50.679> air<00:01:51.490> 3:169

out of the one point six mil air 3:169
steel<00:01:52.689> welding<00:01:53.049> rods<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:54.340> find<00:01:54.609> this

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
steel welding rods and I find this

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.419 
steel welding rods and I find this
absolutely<00:01:54.969> fine<00:01:55.630> no<00:01:55.840> problem<00:01:56.259> I<00:01:56.380> fished<00:01:57.009> the

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
absolutely fine no problem I fished the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.550 
absolutely fine no problem I fished the

river a lot those own or me you might

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.199 
river a lot those own or me you might
further<00:01:59.799> the<00:01:59.950> blending<00:02:00.340> in<00:02:00.459> Wharton<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:00.909> are

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
further the blending in Wharton I are

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.569 
further the blending in Wharton I are
long<00:02:01.420> enough<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.799> do<00:02:02.889> quite<00:02:03.249> a<00:02:03.279> bit<00:02:03.369> of

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
long enough and so I do quite a bit of

we're just going to get the plies the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.479 
we're just going to get the plies the
universal<00:04:07.319> pliers<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.620> straighten<00:04:08.160> up<00:04:08.280> a

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
universal pliers just straighten up a

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.369 
universal pliers just straighten up a
little<00:04:08.519> bit<00:04:08.819> earlier<00:04:09.090> today<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.109> quite<00:04:10.319> a

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
little bit earlier today it is quite a

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.869 
little bit earlier today it is quite a
difficult<00:04:10.590> sort<00:04:10.949> of<00:04:11.129> work<00:04:11.310> with<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.609> quite

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
difficult sort of work with it's quite

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.550 
difficult sort of work with it's quite
thick<00:04:12.209> as<00:04:12.449> you<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.569> say<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:12.959> what

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
thick as you can say so what

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.460 
thick as you can say so what
it's<00:04:14.040> very<00:04:14.250> strong<00:04:14.669> anyway<00:04:15.269> sort<00:04:15.870> you've<00:04:16.229> made

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
it's very strong anyway sort you've made

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.680 
it's very strong anyway sort you've made
you<00:04:16.590> look<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:17.310> applies<00:04:17.609> again<00:04:18.000> pull<00:04:18.599> it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
you look it applies again pull it

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.960 
you look it applies again pull it
through<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.959> CM<00:04:19.380> Paul<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.579> time<00:04:20.849> you

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
through the CM Paul but this time you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.930 
through the CM Paul but this time you
want<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.359> not<00:04:21.690> have<00:04:21.720> done<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.610> tiny<00:04:23.610> tiny

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
want to just not have done a tiny tiny

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.060 
want to just not have done a tiny tiny
little<00:04:24.120> bit<00:04:24.389> I'm<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.440> going<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.620> walk<00:04:25.740> normal

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
little bit I'm just going to walk normal

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.220 
little bit I'm just going to walk normal
a<00:04:26.130> bit<00:04:26.280> purple<00:04:26.520> because<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:26.760> think

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
a bit purple because I think

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.340 
a bit purple because I think
just<00:04:27.560> perform<00:04:27.980> a<00:04:28.040> little<00:04:28.220> bit<00:04:28.340> over<00:04:29.020> half<00:04:30.020> rate

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
just perform a little bit over half rate

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.470 
just perform a little bit over half rate
that's<00:04:30.560> better<00:04:30.830> right<00:04:31.040> so<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.760> pull<00:04:31.970> back<00:04:32.300> in

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
that's better right so you pull back in

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.600 
that's better right so you pull back in
through<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.900> same<00:04:33.170> war<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:34.130> I'll<00:04:34.220> turn<00:04:34.460> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
through the same war but I'll turn it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.460 
through the same war but I'll turn it
aside<00:04:34.880> on<00:04:34.910> just<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.510> see<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.410> you

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
aside on just so you can see it but you

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.440 
aside on just so you can see it but you
don't<00:04:36.740> want<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.130> if<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.280> see<00:04:37.850> where<00:04:38.090> it's<00:04:38.240> down

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
don't want it if you see where it's down

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.840 
don't want it if you see where it's down
there<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.840> want<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.920> little<00:04:40.220> bit<00:04:40.460> about

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
there you want it up a little bit about

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.180 
there you want it up a little bit about
there<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:42.350> reason<00:04:42.530> for<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:42.980> is<00:04:43.160> because

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
there the reason for that is because

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.520 
there the reason for that is because
you're<00:04:44.090> going<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.300> kick<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.720> back<00:04:44.750> up<00:04:45.020> if<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.230> try

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
you're going to kick it back up if I try

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.920 
you're going to kick it back up if I try
to<00:04:45.560> turn<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.130> can<00:04:46.250> see<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:47.060> keep<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.750> back

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
to turn so you can see just keep it back

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.640 
to turn so you can see just keep it back
a<00:04:48.140> little<00:04:48.200> bit<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.220> end<00:04:49.460> up<00:04:49.610> with<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:50.030> I

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
a little bit and you end up with that I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.110 
a little bit and you end up with that I
