00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.629
 Welcome for a start and witnesses video 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.649
 I'm pretty much on the one end 21 point 5 inches 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.349
 500 gigabyte hard drive 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.349
 4 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.349
 while doing RAM and Reiko man and six her heart 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.060
 have fun watching 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 I would of course have a review about a comment or one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.589
 Look forward 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.720
 the iMac through the all aluminum and El Pais Planetary the mountain 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.920
 and lighting and 16 9-picture format 11 Dr 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.350
 and if he's in HD so what to look at 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.720
 or watch your own videos and photos with the help of working alone 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.880
 By default, the iMac Wireless Keyboard is the new Magic Mouse 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.720
 with the revolution in multi-touch technology of the bank 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.830
 instead of mechanical buttons there are scroll wheels or scroll balls 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.510
 the entire surface of the Magic Mouse from a seamless multi-touch 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.720
 surface 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.290
 by finger gestures 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 Cologne - Sal very easy by long documents scrolling over large images 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.290
 swing 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 or by playing forward or backward 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.350
 move a collection of photos or web pages 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.640
 The Magic Mouse may be Nina Proll Club's user with one or more 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.830
 two buttons are configured keyboard as well as mouse who worked with two 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.520
 powered and work well with the good soul of a kalkweiss 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.500
 built-in trip to Hama microphone as well as speaker 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.700
 the Enders because aluminum glass the side are integrated 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.140
 Each iMac has a total of four USB a Firewire 800 port 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.100
 and a new text by the Chancellor 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 The burning of CDs and DVDs is of course thanks to the crib prenner 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.860
 also no problem 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.820
 my conclusion 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.380
 for image editing 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.500
 Viewing and managing documents and cutting videos is the Mac 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.720
 ideally suited and money from me a clear buy recommendation 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.370
 If you do not feel like crashes for the iMac is a must and Feldhausen 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.420
 Euro his price definitely yes
