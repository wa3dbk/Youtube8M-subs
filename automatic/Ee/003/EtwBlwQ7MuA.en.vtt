00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:13.040
 come on way of titans bogdan went there 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.040
 left exit 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.029
 and where everything went fine I want they 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 run from us 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.789
 I have eyes there, I'm going to go blackhole 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 such a base and now I'm in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 deep thoughts 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 the mystery of this error as it was my 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:53.239
 the game was killed. still to blame for these 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.269
 annoying defeats who is the weak link 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.080
 dude is definitely the weakest link for me right now 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:05.610
 It seems or random heroes on their side 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.229
 In general, yes, and it will fall well, my migrant 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.549
 here is this tree she bids us games 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.549
 I can learn to point us in this rink 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 I donâ€™t have enough time to play this game 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.770
 you die too fast how many 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.939
 now take off 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.859
 I fucked this game all previous 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.020
 In addition, part 3 is just a theorem due and 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.770
 plays until we don't mind on 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.399
 Random so and years no longer 6k god 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:59.869
 The bullseye is not 5 to that srednika now 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.869
 hearth thrash and gordon tiles srednyachok 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:08.090
 losses 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:11.800
 I don't want to sleep 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:18.640
 jack so what can it be time 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:21.880
 it tastes like me yesterday 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.260
 One- hundred percent misunderstood 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.710

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.100

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.240
 now for 16 but I am so reeled 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.790
 just feel like nowhere 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.970
