00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it comes to a skincare routine I just

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.639 
it comes to a skincare routine I just
have<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> force<00:00:32.880> myself<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
have to force myself to just do it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.350

because<00:00:34.980> otherwise<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.700> really<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.180> don't

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
because otherwise I really just don't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350 
because otherwise I really just don't
care<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:37.110> skin<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.790> does<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> wants

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
care and my skin just does what it wants

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080 
care and my skin just does what it wants
so<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> point<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so I don't know what the point of that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.389 
so I don't know what the point of that
explanation<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.440> let's<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.829> started<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
explanation was but let's get started I

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.700 
explanation was but let's get started I
would<00:00:44.789> say<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.510> normal<00:00:46.140> combination

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
would say that I have normal combination

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.560 
would say that I have normal combination
skin<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
skin now I know that's not really a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.250 
skin now I know that's not really a
thing<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:49.410> normally<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.309> dry<00:00:51.030> /<00:00:51.420> normal<00:00:51.960> or

a<00:02:35.640> generally<00:02:36.540> similar<00:02:37.440> effect<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.790> use<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
a generally similar effect so I use this

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
a generally similar effect so I use this
in<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.110> shower<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.590> has<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.770> timer<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.790> it's

in the shower it has a timer so it's

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.530 
in the shower it has a timer so it's
like<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.510> think<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.500> 20<00:02:43.830> seconds<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.970> for

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
like I think it's like 20 seconds up for

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.420 
like I think it's like 20 seconds up for
like<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> forehead<00:02:45.990> 20<00:02:46.590> seconds<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:46.980> this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
like a forehead 20 seconds for like this

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.580 
like a forehead 20 seconds for like this
middle<00:02:48.000> region<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.660> then<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:48.930> 10<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.470> each

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
middle region and then like 10 for each

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.610 
middle region and then like 10 for each
cheek<00:02:50.280> area<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:51.090> believe<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.780> how<00:02:51.959> much<00:02:52.140> time<00:02:52.470> is
