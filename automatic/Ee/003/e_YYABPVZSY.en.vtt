like<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.040> sorta<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:32.819> up<00:03:33.140> was<00:03:34.140> really

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
like that sorta like up was really

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
like that sorta like up was really
smooth<00:03:34.620> concrete<00:03:34.920> legends<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.849> a

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
smooth concrete legends like that a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.020 
smooth concrete legends like that a
benches<00:03:36.360> like<00:03:36.569> those<00:03:37.079> right<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.530> see

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
benches like those right there you see

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.250 
benches like those right there you see
so<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.150> should<00:03:39.269> escape<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.659> bench<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.049> escape

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
so we should escape the bench to escape

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.630 
so we should escape the bench to escape
the<00:03:40.379> gap<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.310> kind<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.579> just

so that's like

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.860 
so that's like
I<00:03:55.549> had<00:03:56.549> some<00:03:56.730> footage<00:03:57.000> skating<00:03:57.480> air<00:03:57.629> lights

for<00:04:01.319> Black<00:04:01.469> Label<00:04:01.730> like<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.180> think<00:04:03.480> it's<00:04:03.719> a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
for Black Label like I think it's a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.690 
for Black Label like I think it's a
couple<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.049> clips<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.439> just<00:04:05.040> video<00:04:05.370> then<00:04:05.549> go

couple of clips and just video then go

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.020 
couple of clips and just video then go
down<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:11.040> spot<00:04:11.250> was<00:04:11.370> always<00:04:11.579> like<00:04:11.700> you'd<00:04:11.849> show

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
down the spot was always like you'd show

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.490 
down the spot was always like you'd show
up<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.420> would<00:04:12.510> look<00:04:12.659> amazing<00:04:12.810> we're<00:04:13.290> glad

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
up and it would look amazing we're glad

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
up and it would look amazing we're glad
it's<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.739> still<00:04:14.159> escape<00:04:14.639> its<00:04:14.879> banks<00:04:15.269> all<00:04:15.389> over

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it's not still escape its banks all over

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.070 
it's not still escape its banks all over
the<00:04:15.629> place<00:04:15.810> because<00:04:16.139> then<00:04:16.229> once<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.680> skate<00:04:16.949> it
