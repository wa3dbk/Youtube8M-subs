00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
originated from this one here is I don't

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.440 
originated from this one here is I don't
know<00:00:14.259> how<00:00:14.710> old<00:00:14.920> it<00:00:15.099> is<00:00:15.160> exactly<00:00:15.759> or<00:00:16.090> who<00:00:16.240> made

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
know how old it is exactly or who made

it there's no manufacturer on it but it
probably<00:00:19.150> predates<00:00:19.710> 1870<00:00:20.710> because<00:00:21.010> it<00:00:21.130> has

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
probably predates 1870 because it has
