00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.650
 Today I'm going to show you how to put together the cube of 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.460
 rubik 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.120
 with the novice method or beginners 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.700
 uy 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.610
 so 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.530
 we have to know three little things that the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.280
 box is made up of three tabs 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.040
 different that would be for example center 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.500
 edge and corner then the center will 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.540
 recognizes because it only has one color and one 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.090
 only color the edges have two 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.630
 colors and the corners have three 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.630
 colors 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.460
 Well, I'll show you all of a sudden 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.670
 some exercises for the fingers for 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.090
 drop the hand that is called seventh and 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 consists of these steps 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.590
 you 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.690
 left down right 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.130
 if I repeat that movement called 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.700
 sexy six times the cube that put together a 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700
 two 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.790
 4 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.300
 5 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.100
 that way then how is the 2000 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.450
 I turn to the left if it 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.940
 took so that then towards the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 left low 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.350
 and it is to the right 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.990
 I climb left down right 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.030
 left down right you have to have in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.830
 another little thing counts these two little fingers 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 the race as I handle them here 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.910
 this title I put here in front and the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.300
 big toe down here in all the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.310
 half of the four and this other carriÃ³ 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.810
 so that when I go up this 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.620
 milestone that I have prepared to do 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.990
 I left and this one edited 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.890
 right but then these three fingers 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 I raise them from here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.440
 in this way I am turning my fingers 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.939
 and over time we can do this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.940
 way is a very useful exercise for 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.280
 hands will let your fingers loose 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.990
 to move fast course ready 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.990
 it's faster I wanted to like that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.270
 we can also execute it with the hand 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270
 left 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.390
 we can also do a sexy ting ting 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 ting ting and we can return it then 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 would be here your web flight of your 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 left down right and an antisec and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.840
 would be right I climb left down to have 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 in account is we can practice sexy of 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.780
 this way 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.069
 and we can practice antisec so that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 also release the fingers of the other 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.569
 way that is the two ways we're going to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.459
 use a lot to be able to assemble the cube 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.459
 for that reason from the session explaining before
