because<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.960> play<00:00:13.710> my<00:00:13.950> clarinet<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:15.210> birds

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
because I play my clarinet with birds

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.050 
because I play my clarinet with birds
trying<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.619> understand<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.190> they're<00:00:17.310> doing

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.910 

why<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.350> think<00:00:22.590> there's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
why do I do this because I think there's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.189 
why do I do this because I think there's
more<00:00:23.220> music<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> animal<00:00:24.630> world<00:00:24.779> when

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
more music in the animal world when

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
more music in the animal world when
there<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.470> language<00:00:26.060> because<00:00:27.060> animals<00:00:27.570> make

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
there is language because animals make

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.050 
there is language because animals make
all<00:00:27.960> kinds<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> sounds<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.760> not<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all kinds of sounds but it's not that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.530 
all kinds of sounds but it's not that
many<00:00:30.240> animals<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.050> vocal<00:00:31.500> learning

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
many animals that have vocal learning

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
many animals that have vocal learning
for<00:00:33.540> something<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> humans<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.710> whales

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
for something that humans have whales

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.630 
for something that humans have whales
and<00:00:36.059> dolphins<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> songbirds<00:00:37.860> what

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and dolphins have and songbirds what

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
and dolphins have and songbirds what
this<00:00:38.790> means<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> they<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.360> learn<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.290> new

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
this means is they can learn to make new

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.000 
this means is they can learn to make new
sounds<00:00:41.239> other<00:00:42.239> primates<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.800> new

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sounds other primates it can make new

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.229 
sounds other primates it can make new
sounds<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.579> why<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
sounds that's why if you want to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
sounds that's why if you want to
communicate<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.719> chimpanzees<00:00:46.500> they're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
communicate with chimpanzees they're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.790 
communicate with chimpanzees they're
pushing<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.820> different<00:00:48.270> matrix<00:00:48.870> devices<00:00:49.649> or

pushing on different matrix devices or

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.639 
pushing on different matrix devices or
they<00:00:49.920> need<00:00:50.070> sign<00:00:50.489> language<00:00:51.110> whales<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
they need sign language whales and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.119 
they need sign language whales and
humans<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.579> birds<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.870> learn<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.829> sound

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
humans and birds can learn with sound

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
humans and birds can learn with sound
you<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.180> why<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:57.899> animals

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you don't know why just these animals

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.389 
you don't know why just these animals
can<00:00:58.530> learn<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
can learn with you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.639 
can learn with you
well<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.730> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> sounds<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.660> very

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
well what kind of sounds they make very

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.470 
well what kind of sounds they make very
often<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:02.789> sounds<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.270> have<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
often they don't make sounds that have a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
often they don't make sounds that have a
specific<00:01:04.110> meaning<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> language<00:01:05.760> when

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
specific meaning like a language when

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.539 
specific meaning like a language when
they<00:01:06.030> make<00:01:06.180> sounds<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.229> structured<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
they make sounds that are structured in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
they make sounds that are structured in
and<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> themselves<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> beginning

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and of themselves at the beginning

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.330 
and of themselves at the beginning
middle<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.950> end

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
middle and an end

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
middle and an end
like<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.640> emotional<00:01:12.210> statement<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.780> sound

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
like an emotional statement with sound

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.499 
like an emotional statement with sound
that's<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> bird<00:01:14.220> song<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.390> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's what a bird song really is in all

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's what a bird song really is in all
its<00:01:15.689> complexity<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.860> its<00:01:17.189> structure<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
campus these are complicated mixtures of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
campus these are complicated mixtures of
sounds<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.439> beginning<00:01:25.950> middle<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.490> end<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
doing things what do all these sounds

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
doing things what do all these sounds
mean<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.600> bird<00:01:36.930> songs<00:01:37.259> mean<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> same

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
mean in all bird songs mean the same

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.760 
mean in all bird songs mean the same
thing<00:01:38.310> male<00:01:39.210> birds<00:01:39.600> are<00:01:39.840> singing<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.380> defend

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
thing male birds are singing to defend

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880 
thing male birds are singing to defend
territories<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.850> attract<00:01:42.780> mates<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.770> all

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
territories and attract mates they all

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
territories and attract mates they all
mean<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> same<00:01:44.340> thing<00:01:44.759> why<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
mean the same thing why then are they so

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
mean the same thing why then are they so
different<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.320> complexity<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.640> bird<00:01:47.970> might

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
different in complexity one bird might

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
different in complexity one bird might
sing<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.750> short<00:01:48.990> song<00:01:49.350> another<00:01:49.770> might

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
sing a really short song another might

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
sing a really short song another might
like<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> Mockingbird<00:01:51.119> sing<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> song<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like a Mockingbird sing a song that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
like a Mockingbird sing a song that
could<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.560> 40<00:01:52.890> minutes<00:01:53.070> why<00:01:53.970> does<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
could go on for 40 minutes why does it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.149 
could go on for 40 minutes why does it
mean

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
mean

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.679 
mean
have<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.280> song<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.450> know<00:01:56.570> it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
have a song like that you know it

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.440 
have a song like that you know it
doesn't<00:01:56.929> really<00:01:57.170> need<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.850> not<00:01:58.969> do<00:01:59.179> anything

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
doesn't really need it's not do anything

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.779 
doesn't really need it's not do anything
more<00:01:59.780> complicated<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:00.770> has<00:02:00.950> evolved<00:02:01.579> a

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
more complicated it just has evolved a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.139 
more complicated it just has evolved a
different<00:02:02.149> way<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.810> life<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.649> I<00:02:04.149> approaching

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
different way of life and I approaching

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.350 
different way of life and I approaching
this<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> musician<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:06.880> say<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.179> these

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
this as a musician I say that these

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.210 
this as a musician I say that these
birds<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> different<00:02:09.500> aesthetic<00:02:09.679> they've

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
birds have a different aesthetic they've

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.710 
birds have a different aesthetic they've
evolved<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.759> whole<00:02:10.910> different<00:02:11.269> aesthetic

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
evolved a whole different aesthetic

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.110 
evolved a whole different aesthetic
sense<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.260> we<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.349> study<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.370> aesthetic<00:02:13.940> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
sense and we can study the aesthetic of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.990 
sense and we can study the aesthetic of
bird<00:02:14.360> songs<00:02:14.750> similarly<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> way<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.640> study

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
bird songs similarly to the way we study

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.699 
bird songs similarly to the way we study
the<00:02:17.180> music<00:02:17.360> from<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.810> different<00:02:18.140> culture<00:02:18.560> than

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the music from a different culture than

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.949 
the music from a different culture than
our<00:02:18.830> own<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.269> how<00:02:20.420> I've<00:02:20.540> tried<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
our own and this is how I've tried to

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.500 
our own and this is how I've tried to
use<00:02:20.989> music<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:22.250> contribute<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> what<00:02:23.060> science

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
use music to contribute to what science

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.710 
use music to contribute to what science
is<00:02:23.629> doing<00:02:23.959> on<00:02:24.080> bird<00:02:24.349> songs<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.910> how<00:02:26.540> does<00:02:26.599> one

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
is doing on bird songs now how does one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.170 
is doing on bird songs now how does one
study<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.379> in<00:02:27.560> any<00:02:27.709> serious<00:02:28.160> way<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:31.000> say<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
study this in any serious way I say as a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.940 
study this in any serious way I say as a
musician<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.870> cannot<00:02:33.170> study<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.709> without

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
musician you cannot study this without

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.130 
musician you cannot study this without
recognizing<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.879> principles<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.629> value<00:02:36.019> of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
recognizing the principles and value of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.390 
recognizing the principles and value of
music<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:38.209> aid<00:02:38.420> biology<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:40.280> after

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
music to aid biology and going after

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.930 
music to aid biology and going after
complex<00:02:41.120> songs<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:43.099> is<00:02:43.280> something<00:02:43.549> that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
complex songs and this is something that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.330 
complex songs and this is something that
you<00:02:44.810> need<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.049> bring<00:02:45.440> art<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:45.920> science

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you need to bring art and science

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.949 
you need to bring art and science
together<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.180> why<00:02:47.420> I've<00:02:47.569> been<00:02:47.720> trying

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
together so this is why I've been trying

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.319 
together so this is why I've been trying
to<00:02:47.989> work<00:02:48.200> together<00:02:48.410> with<00:02:49.280> biologists<00:02:50.150> to

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
to work together with biologists to

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.750 
to work together with biologists to
combine<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> musical<00:02:51.470> aesthetic<00:02:52.250> approach<00:02:52.549> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
combine a musical aesthetic approach to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.460 
combine a musical aesthetic approach to
birdsong<00:02:53.269> with<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.019> quantifiable<00:02:55.420> scientific

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
birdsong with a quantifiable scientific

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.720 
birdsong with a quantifiable scientific
statistical<00:02:57.470> approach<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.950> birdsong<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
statistical approach to birdsong and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
statistical approach to birdsong and
this<00:02:59.000> unit<00:02:59.389> this<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.569> really<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.019> perfect

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
this unit this is really the perfect

this unit this is really the perfect
kind<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.680> work<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.579> do<00:03:01.760> at<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.940> New<00:03:02.180> Jersey
