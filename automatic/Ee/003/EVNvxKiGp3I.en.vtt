00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
there's no question that Super Mario

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
there's no question that Super Mario
Galaxy<00:00:16.020> 2<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> games<00:00:17.520> we're<00:00:17.850> most

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
Galaxy 2 is one of the games we're most

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
Galaxy 2 is one of the games we're most
excited<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.230> next<00:00:19.529> play

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
excited about here next play

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.710 
excited about here next play
and<00:00:20.189> our<00:00:20.369> latest<00:00:20.520> glimpse<00:00:21.060> makes<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> even

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and our latest glimpse makes it even

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.259 
and our latest glimpse makes it even
hungrier<00:00:22.260> from<00:00:22.529> where<00:00:22.680> Mario<00:00:23.100> mayhem<00:00:23.580> what

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hungrier from where Mario mayhem what

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.050 
hungrier from where Mario mayhem what
makes<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.340> well<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:26.760> makes<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
makes this well I think what makes it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.460 
makes this well I think what makes it
more<00:00:27.150> than<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.510> sequel<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
more than just a sequel is that the the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.839 
more than just a sequel is that the the
development<00:00:28.920> team<00:00:29.039> really<00:00:29.310> took<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> look<00:00:29.670> at

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
development team really took a look at

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.730 
development team really took a look at
the<00:00:29.970> original<00:00:30.269> Super<00:00:30.480> Mario<00:00:30.539> Galaxy<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.289> we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the original Super Mario Galaxy and we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.930 
the original Super Mario Galaxy and we
really<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.099> there's<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.309> lot<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.880> we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
really think there's a lot more that we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
really think there's a lot more that we
can<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.390> within<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.170> structure<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.309> they

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
can do within that structure and so they

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
can do within that structure and so they
basically<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.750> last

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
basically really just for like the last

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540 
basically really just for like the last
year<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> half<00:00:37.320> been<00:00:37.590> having<00:00:37.860> fun<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> so

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
year and a half been having fun and so

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
year and a half been having fun and so
instead<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.090> seeing<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
instead of just seeing kind of more the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.630 
instead of just seeing kind of more the
same<00:00:40.469> they've<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.100> taken<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.520> new

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
same they've really taken in new

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
same they've really taken in new
directions<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.149> added<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> whole<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> new

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
directions and added a whole lot of new

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.920 
directions and added a whole lot of new
mechanics<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> game<00:00:47.600> take<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.899> example

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
mechanics to the game take for example

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
mechanics to the game take for example
the<00:00:49.590> new<00:00:49.710> ability<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> drill<00:00:50.430> your<00:00:50.520> way

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the new ability to drill your way

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
the new ability to drill your way
through<00:00:50.850> planets<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.110> way<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> drill

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
through planets the way that the drill

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
through planets the way that the drill
works<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.579> start<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.030> side<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
works is you start on one side of the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
works is you start on one side of the
planet<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> quick<00:00:55.350> shake<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> Wii

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
planet and with a quick shake of the Wii

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.979 
planet and with a quick shake of the Wii
Remote<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.390> through<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> other

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
Remote you go right through to the other

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
Remote you go right through to the other
side<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.620> opens<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> whole<00:00:59.219> bunch<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
side and that opens up a whole bunch of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.260 
side and that opens up a whole bunch of
puzzle<00:00:59.940> solving<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.640> expect<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
puzzle solving and you can expect to see

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
puzzle solving and you can expect to see
a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.750> Mario's<00:01:04.199> best<00:01:04.500> friend<00:01:04.739> Yoshi

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
a lot more of Mario's best friend Yoshi

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
a lot more of Mario's best friend Yoshi
in<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> installment<00:01:06.020> Yoshi's<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.320> be

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
in this installment Yoshi's not gonna be

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.080 
in this installment Yoshi's not gonna be
in<00:01:07.530> every<00:01:07.710> level<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.280> Yoshi<00:01:08.520> does<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
in every level but what Yoshi does is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
in every level but what Yoshi does is
adds<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> whole<00:01:09.720> new<00:01:10.049> set<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.820> different

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
adds a whole new set of different

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
adds a whole new set of different
activities<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.540> Mario<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.470> terms<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
activities that Mario can do in terms of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
activities that Mario can do in terms of
writing<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.520> Yoshi<00:01:14.760> Yoshi's<00:01:15.240> flutter<00:01:15.509> kick

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
writing on Yoshi Yoshi's flutter kick

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
writing on Yoshi Yoshi's flutter kick
and<00:01:16.049> he'll<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.290> pulling<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.799> new<00:01:17.400> platforms

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and he'll be pulling out new platforms

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
and he'll be pulling out new platforms
for<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.540> jump<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.259> probably<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
for them to jump on but probably the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
for them to jump on but probably the
biggest<00:01:19.920> new<00:01:20.280> mechanic<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:20.820> Yoshi<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.479> all

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
biggest new mechanic with Yoshi is all

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
biggest new mechanic with Yoshi is all
of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> different<00:01:22.409> fruits<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
of the different fruits the one is the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
of the different fruits the one is the
blimp<00:01:23.640> fruit<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.150> Yoshi<00:01:24.330> eats<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> he

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
blimp fruit when Yoshi eats it he

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
blimp fruit when Yoshi eats it he
inflates<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> great<00:01:26.159> balloon

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
inflates and it's this great balloon

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
inflates and it's this great balloon
shape<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> goes<00:01:27.600> shooting<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> sky

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
shape and goes shooting up into the sky

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
shape and goes shooting up into the sky
with<00:01:28.979> Mario<00:01:29.340> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.790> gripping<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> as

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
with Mario kind of like gripping on as

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
with Mario kind of like gripping on as
tightly<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.310> personal

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
tightly as you can and then my personal

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.450 
tightly as you can and then my personal
favorite<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> dash<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.290> basically<00:01:35.070> Yoshi

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
favorite is the dash and basically Yoshi

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.789 
favorite is the dash and basically Yoshi
eats<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.030> red<00:01:36.360> hot<00:01:36.540> pepper<00:01:36.750> goes<00:01:37.110> taking<00:01:37.650> off

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
eats this red hot pepper goes taking off

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
eats this red hot pepper goes taking off
at<00:01:38.310> super<00:01:38.759> high<00:01:38.880> speed<00:01:39.180> super<00:01:39.750> fast<00:01:39.960> up

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
at super high speed super fast up

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.539 
at super high speed super fast up
vertical<00:01:40.680> faces<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.250> you've<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
vertical faces and you've got to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.890 
vertical faces and you've got to
navigate<00:01:41.700> him<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.420> these<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.899> planes

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
navigate him on these these planes

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.180 
navigate him on these these planes
so<00:01:45.900> that's<00:01:46.050> one<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.260> big<00:01:46.410> dynamics<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> 2d

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
so that's one of the big dynamics the 2d

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.710 
so that's one of the big dynamics the 2d
platforming<00:01:47.670> combined<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.330> 3d

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
platforming combined with the 3d

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.660 
platforming combined with the 3d
platforming<00:01:49.500> how<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:49.950> seeing<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.280> kind

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
platforming how are we seeing that kind

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580 
platforming how are we seeing that kind
of<00:01:50.820> been<00:01:51.090> built<00:01:51.360> upon<00:01:51.480> in<00:01:51.930> Super<00:01:52.290> Mario<00:01:52.320> Galaxy

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
of been built upon in Super Mario Galaxy

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
of been built upon in Super Mario Galaxy
2<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.550> in<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.820> original<00:01:54.510> they<00:01:54.660> had<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.870> few

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
2 right in the original they had a few

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.010 
2 right in the original they had a few
of<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> these<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.190> pseudo<00:01:56.490> 2d<00:01:57.390> /<00:01:57.720> 3d

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
of kind of these these pseudo 2d / 3d

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
of kind of these these pseudo 2d / 3d
platforming<00:01:58.560> levels<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.430> they've

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
platforming levels and this time they've

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.390 
platforming levels and this time they've
really<00:02:00.210> taken<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:00.810> further

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
really taken that even further

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.950 
really taken that even further
particularly<00:02:02.400> with<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:03.030> shifting<00:02:03.570> gravity

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
particularly with the shifting gravity

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
particularly with the shifting gravity
fields<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.830> obviously<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> played<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> game

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
fields so obviously you played the game

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.850 
fields so obviously you played the game
a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.180> than<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.900> what's<00:02:07.680> your

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a lot more than I have what's your

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.920 
a lot more than I have what's your
favorite<00:02:08.460> addition<00:02:08.820> with<00:02:09.210> Yoshi<00:02:09.479> there<00:02:09.840> are

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
favorite addition with Yoshi there are

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.300 
favorite addition with Yoshi there are
these<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.170> flower<00:02:10.500> pegs<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.070> he<00:02:11.190> can

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
these little flower pegs that he can

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.680 
these little flower pegs that he can
grab<00:02:11.490> with<00:02:11.610> his<00:02:11.670> tongue<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:12.270> he<00:02:12.360> grabs

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
grab with his tongue and when he grabs

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.330 
grab with his tongue and when he grabs
him<00:02:12.900> he<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.680> flings<00:02:13.920> him<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
him he just kind of flings him up in the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.830 
him he just kind of flings him up in the
air<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.670> he<00:02:14.760> makes<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.390> cute<00:02:15.570> noise

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
air and he makes this really cute noise

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110 
air and he makes this really cute noise
where<00:02:16.050> he<00:02:16.110> goes<00:02:16.260> boy<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.820> much<00:02:17.910> fun
