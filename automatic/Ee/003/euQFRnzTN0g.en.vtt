is one part art and one part science and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.109 
is one part art and one part science and
the<00:01:54.740> art<00:01:54.890> part<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.400> difficult<00:01:55.760> to

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
the art part is very difficult to

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.850 
the art part is very difficult to
understand<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:56.960> exactly<00:01:57.050> how<00:01:57.500> long<00:01:57.650> it's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860

going<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.100> take<00:01:59.500> concept<00:02:00.500> artist<00:02:00.800> tries<00:02:01.310> to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
going to take concept artist tries to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
going to take concept artist tries to
communicate<00:02:01.970> through<00:02:02.660> composition<00:02:03.560> what<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
communicate through composition what the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.870 
communicate through composition what the
idea<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.670> trying<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.150> across<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:06.790> lot<00:02:07.790> of

idea is trying to get across a lot of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.730 
idea is trying to get across a lot of
times<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.179> direction<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.140> gets<00:02:09.380> narrow

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
times the direction just gets narrow

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.790 
times the direction just gets narrow
down<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.010> can<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.670> make<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:10.970> look<00:02:11.209> cool

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
down to can you just make it look cool

interesting<00:05:25.080> thing<00:05:25.440> with<00:05:25.590> some<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.890> ideas

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
interesting thing with some of the ideas

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.880 
interesting thing with some of the ideas
that<00:05:26.220> we<00:05:26.460> came<00:05:26.640> up<00:05:26.700> with<00:05:27.000> is<00:05:27.210> uh<00:05:27.530> not<00:05:28.530> only<00:05:28.560> do

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
that we came up with is uh not only do

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.260 
that we came up with is uh not only do
we<00:05:28.980> need<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.190> figure<00:05:29.340> out<00:05:29.460> how<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.670> Brutes

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
we need to figure out how the Brutes

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.420 
we need to figure out how the Brutes
interact<00:05:30.870> with<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.140> other<00:05:31.260> covenant<00:05:31.800> but

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
interact with the other covenant but

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.400 
interact with the other covenant but
also<00:05:32.550> how<00:05:32.790> brutes<00:05:33.060> interact<00:05:33.510> with<00:05:33.690> fruits<00:05:34.110> and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
also how brutes interact with fruits and

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.290 
also how brutes interact with fruits and
we<00:05:35.160> developed<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.610> idea<00:05:35.640> of<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.000> brute<00:05:36.330> pack

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
we developed the idea of the brute pack

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.460 
we developed the idea of the brute pack
what<00:05:39.300> makes<00:05:39.450> it<00:05:39.570> feel<00:05:39.720> like<00:05:39.750> two<00:05:40.080> characters

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
what makes it feel like two characters

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.110 
what makes it feel like two characters
are<00:05:40.590> aware<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.830> each<00:05:41.010> other<00:05:41.190> deciding<00:05:41.850> to<00:05:42.000> do

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
are aware of each other deciding to do

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.780 
are aware of each other deciding to do
the<00:05:42.270> same<00:05:42.480> thing<00:05:42.750> at<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.900> same<00:05:42.990> time<00:05:43.790> maybe

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
the same thing at the same time maybe

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.130 
the same thing at the same time maybe
you're<00:05:44.970> gonna<00:05:45.180> come<00:05:45.420> around<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.750> corner<00:05:45.780> and
