wasn't right happy but then I decided to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130 
wasn't right happy but then I decided to
kind<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> experiment<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.299> different<00:01:30.659> ways

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
kind of experiment with different ways

kind of experiment with different ways
to<00:01:31.380> apply<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.970> a

to apply it because I know there are a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
to apply it because I know there are a
lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.329> different<00:01:33.630> ways<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
lot of different ways and what the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
lot of different ways and what the
bottle<00:01:34.920> says<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.610> always<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.479> then

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
bottle says is not always right so then

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.980 
bottle says is not always right so then
I<00:01:37.200> tried<00:01:37.350> doing<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.579> primer<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.750> then

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I tried doing my primer first and then

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.080 
I tried doing my primer first and then
spraying<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.340> spraying<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> again

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
spraying this and then spraying it again

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
spraying this and then spraying it again
at<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> very<00:01:42.540> end<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> my<00:01:42.930> makeup<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
at the very end of my makeup and again I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.710 
at the very end of my makeup and again I
didn't<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.610> notice<00:01:44.790> much<00:01:45.090> difference<00:01:45.119> I'm

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
didn't really notice much difference I'm

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.819 
didn't really notice much difference I'm
like<00:01:45.899> ah<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.409> sucks

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
like ah this sucks

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
like ah this sucks
so<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> tried<00:01:47.759> again<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so then I tried again and the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
so then I tried again and the
combination<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> found<00:01:50.220> works<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> best

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
combination that I found works the best

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.960 
combination that I found works the best
for<00:01:51.210> me<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.560> spray<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.250> first<00:01:53.729> thing

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
for me is if I spray this on first thing

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.719 
for me is if I spray this on first thing

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.740 
to completely dry so then I'd close my
eyes<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.340> spray<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.850> then<00:02:42.330> I'd<00:02:42.569> have

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
eyes to spray this and then I'd have

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.400 
eyes to spray this and then I'd have
like<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.200> mascara<00:02:43.620> rings<00:02:43.890> all<00:02:44.190> around<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:46.200> my

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
about but it's nice not that it really

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.789 
about but it's nice not that it really

even after just like a normal day not
doing<00:03:25.290> any<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.500> completely<00:03:26.190> physical

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
doing any like completely physical

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.819 
doing any like completely physical
activity<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.329> just<00:03:27.840> yeah<00:03:27.959> my<00:03:28.140> face<00:03:28.380> doesn't<00:03:28.739> get

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
activity I just yeah my face doesn't get

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.940 
activity I just yeah my face doesn't get
shiny<00:03:29.130> at<00:03:29.340> all<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.350> completely

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
shiny at all and it is completely

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.740 
shiny at all and it is completely
because<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.970> mean<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> good

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
because of this I mean I have a good

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.960 
because of this I mean I have a good
foundation<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.560> combats<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.310> as<00:03:35.489> well<00:03:35.700> but

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
foundation that combats that as well but

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.670 
foundation that combats that as well but
but<00:03:36.569> even<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:37.019> tell<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.230> difference<00:03:37.350> of

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
but even I can tell the difference of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.199 
but even I can tell the difference of
just<00:03:37.709> using<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.340> foundation<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.060> then

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
just using that foundation and then

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.509 
just using that foundation and then
using<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.630> Plus<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.200> foundation<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.920> this

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
using this Plus that foundation and this

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.910 
using this Plus that foundation and this
just<00:03:42.150> helps<00:03:42.420> control<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.230> much<00:03:43.440> better<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
just helps control it so much better I

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
just helps control it so much better I
know<00:03:44.220> other<00:03:44.489> people<00:03:44.579> say<00:03:45.060> different<00:03:45.480> things

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
know other people say different things

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
know other people say different things
that<00:03:46.049> how<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.260> apply<00:03:46.590> at<00:03:46.769> best<00:03:47.100> or<00:03:47.400> for<00:03:47.579> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
couple seconds um and yeah so I actually

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.280 
couple seconds um and yeah so I actually
really<00:04:36.330> recommend<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.110> very

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
really recommend this it is very

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.650 
really recommend this it is very
expensive<00:04:37.530> 40<00:04:38.160> bucks<00:04:38.310> or<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.730> think<00:04:38.880> 35<00:04:39.450> in<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
expensive 40 bucks or I think 35 in the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.110 
expensive 40 bucks or I think 35 in the
US<00:04:39.900> but<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.470> actually<00:04:40.860> do<00:04:41.280> think<00:04:41.310> it's<00:04:41.670> worth<00:04:41.850> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
US but I actually do think it's worth it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.990 
US but I actually do think it's worth it
and<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:43.020> will<00:04:43.800> repurchase<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.580> because<00:04:44.970> I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
and I will repurchase this because I

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.810 
and I will repurchase this because I
have<00:04:45.330> noticed<00:04:45.600> an<00:04:45.960> actual<00:04:46.650> difference<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.340> I

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
have noticed an actual difference and I

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.030 
have noticed an actual difference and I
like<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.420> results<00:04:48.840> my<00:04:49.050> face<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.470> not<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.740> shiny

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
like the results my face is not a shiny

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.580 
like the results my face is not a shiny
