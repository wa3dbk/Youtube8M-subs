00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to actively bring the water from this

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.219 
to actively bring the water from this
pond<00:00:58.379> put<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.309> back<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> Kinney<00:01:00.089> so<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
pond put it back into the Kinney so it

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.259 
pond put it back into the Kinney so it
stays<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.860> nice<00:01:02.010> cool<00:01:02.250> temperature<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
stays in a nice cool temperature and you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.640 
stays in a nice cool temperature and you
don't<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.600> all<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.869> runoff<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.350> them<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.559> the
