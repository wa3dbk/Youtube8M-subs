00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.490
 good to go out for the goal but what 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.190
 important are the three points 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.349
 but how was the team these last 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.730
 matches so I'm really glad 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.619
 for the goal for the first one in the betis 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.720
 but the important thing is the three points 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.720
 victory and position in a bone 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.920
 I think the goal is making the 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.970
 things well the team work well I 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.970
 he was finding me well 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.480
 as seen in the field 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.040
 in the trainings we also 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.540
 we understand very well in the dressing room 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.540
 we also talk about it 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 has been able to demonstrate 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 I'm normal good is not the victory 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.390
 but as I told you, the important thing 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.860
 been the three points the work the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 team and the group has been prepared to 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.260
 see and repeatedly in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260
 TV 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.170
 yes yes yes yes yes it is true that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.860
 when they have changed me I do not have any 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.860
 less cramping 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.080
 Yes, it is logical because it marks the goal 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.409
 it does not come a little bit up, it motivates you 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.490
 normal good I think the mister 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.240
 delay my disposition I find myself 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.759
 very comfortable and the truth 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.079
 and nothing at the end this is a team and 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.399
 where do I make you encouraging? 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.990
 try to do your best but 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.259
 good if it is true that behind me 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 more comfortable meeting and the best of me I 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.049
 I think it was fundamental, it's clear 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.400
 today not winning would be a step back very 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.750
 great I think we have taken a step 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.090
 forward now you have to go there because 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.790
 was to beat them and I think the classification 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 is going to stay is going to stay 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.440
 practically made man is important 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.970
 this competition thanks to God gives us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.560
 encouragement because in league things do not 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.080
 are coming out I think people have 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.420
 state of 10 and very happy because no 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.950
 we deserved another the hobby and everything 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 because in the end day by day you work and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.000
 when it does not take the results then 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.039
 one is leaving sad saba fucked and I think that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 that for the good of all has been 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 great, well, I think it's clear 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.560
 that we have a couple of leaders within the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.480
 wardrobe as they are this year is good 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
 this party has been damiani and antonio 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.910
 we have been told that what we play 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.370
 it is clear that it can not be the streak that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.500
 we can not be that many 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 defeats and less at home because 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.150
 expectations that we have are are high and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.970
 I think it's a good 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.489
 touchstone to know that this is 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.349
 the way but if they are very happy 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.599
 for him because the truth is that it is already 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.730
 here you criticize too much I think it 's 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.959
 a young boy who is starting and I think 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.120
 that you have to respect it because it's a 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.590
 value of the quarry and had to be respected 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.299
 and take care of him and as I said before 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.099
 party that you will enjoy and that you do not have 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.540
 to prove anything to anyone because everything 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.680
 the world knows what it can do and already 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.829
 the only thing that remains is to enjoy and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.040
 come back to enjoy this sport and 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.530
 do the player who was and if he makes me 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.909
 a lot because the truth is that as a child 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.440
 he was a little follower of the athletic and the 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.299
 I really liked ethics a lot 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 Milinko Pantic Madrid and company 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.659
 I really enjoyed the doublet and it makes me 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.310
 illusion also because it already takes our 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.359
 my parents to the tier and the truth is that 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.970
 I want to be seen in 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.680
 direct because when I'm here and 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.450
 only if the truth that very happy of 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 back to madrid and well we needed it 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.290
 no yes that is true that always 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.689
 we went out in every game like we were 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.569
 a little bit more because we knew what 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.420
 we played and what I needed 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.950
 good especially the heavyweights the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.079
 schedules and this be aware though of 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.969
 the importance of the party we had 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.469
 to win every flight and that's what we 've 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.719
 done not die in each ball in each 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.510
 play of being a team and it will be a fact 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.159
 yeah good god the minimums that I can that 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.000
 I can offer and thank the mister is 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.250
 A) Yes 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.840
 giving everything in the field fighting each 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.060
 ball as if as if it were the last and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.500
 good the goals and this then I am going to enter 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.500
 it's not a fortune
