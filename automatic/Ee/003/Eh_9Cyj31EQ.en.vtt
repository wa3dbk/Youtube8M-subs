Chane<00:02:10.030> fire<00:02:10.299> can<00:02:10.569> be<00:02:10.689> very<00:02:11.019> useful<00:02:11.530> for

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
Chane fire can be very useful for

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.830 
Chane fire can be very useful for
maintaining<00:02:12.370> heat<00:02:12.760> especially<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:13.629> you<00:02:13.719> have

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
maintaining heat especially if you have

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.649 
maintaining heat especially if you have
a<00:02:13.870> lot<00:02:14.109> of<00:02:14.260> weapons<00:02:14.439> in<00:02:14.769> one<00:02:15.010> group<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.700> find<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
a lot of weapons in one group I find it

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.559 
a lot of weapons in one group I find it
especially<00:02:16.840> useful<00:02:17.349> for<00:02:17.799> using<00:02:17.980> lrm<00:02:18.670> fire<00:02:18.999> in

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
especially useful for using lrm fire in

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.629 
especially useful for using lrm fire in
order<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.079> stagger<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.620> shots<00:02:20.889> so<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.609> I

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:21.639 
order to stagger the shots so that I

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.220 
order to stagger the shots so that I
don't<00:02:21.939> waste<00:02:22.150> ammunition<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.959> long-range

don't waste ammunition on long-range

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.099 
don't waste ammunition on long-range
targets<00:02:24.099> if<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.879> enemy<00:02:25.239> has<00:02:25.269> an<00:02:25.569> anti-missile

system<00:02:26.769> or<00:02:27.189> needs<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.519> take<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> lot<00:02:27.939> of<00:02:28.060> damage

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239

system or needs to take a lot of damage
in<00:02:28.480> quick<00:02:28.689> succession<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.469> will<00:02:30.040> put<00:02:30.189> it<00:02:30.280> into

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
in quick succession I will put it into

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.550 
in quick succession I will put it into
group<00:02:30.700> fire<00:02:30.969> mode<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.109> hit<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.409> with

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
group fire mode so that I hit them with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.649 
group fire mode so that I hit them with
a<00:02:32.590> lot<00:02:32.799> of<00:02:32.920> missiles<00:02:33.280> at<00:02:33.370> once<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.969> good

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
a lot of missiles at once a good

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.869 
a lot of missiles at once a good
suggestion<00:02:35.139> is<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.950> your<00:02:36.250> weapons<00:02:36.730> in

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
suggestion is to have your weapons in

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.000 
suggestion is to have your weapons in
your<00:02:37.120> arms<00:02:37.510> be<00:02:37.780> selected<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.319> one<00:02:38.499> group<00:02:38.829> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
your arms be selected in one group and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.009 
your arms be selected in one group and
then<00:02:39.489> weapons<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:39.939> your<00:02:40.060> torso<00:02:40.359> to<00:02:40.599> be<00:02:40.840> in

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
then weapons in your torso to be in

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.020 
then weapons in your torso to be in
another<00:02:41.409> one<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.430> case<00:02:42.700> what<00:02:42.939> I'm

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
another one so in this case what I'm

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.420 
another one so in this case what I'm
going<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.329> do<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:44.049> take<00:02:44.349> my<00:02:44.590> missiles<00:02:45.010> off<00:02:45.219> of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
going to do is take my missiles off of

going to do is take my missiles off of
group<00:02:45.730> two<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.329> put<00:02:46.959> them<00:02:47.109> on<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.680> group<00:02:48.129> three

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
group two and put them on to group three

group two and put them on to group three
I'm<00:02:48.939> now<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.109> take<00:02:50.439> my<00:02:50.709> small<00:02:51.040> laser<00:02:51.280> and

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
I'm now going to take my small laser and

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
it's in group or chain so now that my

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.550 
it's in group or chain so now that my
weapon<00:02:57.159> groups<00:02:57.430> are<00:02:57.699> set<00:02:57.969> up<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.419> can<00:02:58.840> now<00:02:59.230> hold

weapon<00:03:42.909> firing<00:03:43.209> groups<00:03:43.810> now<00:03:44.259> you<00:03:44.319> can

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
weapon firing groups now you can

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.199 
weapon firing groups now you can
definitely<00:03:44.769> take<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.400> information<00:03:45.639> and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
definitely take this information and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.559 
definitely take this information and
configure<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.629> however<00:03:47.139> you<00:03:47.470> want<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:49.389> have

configure it however you want you have
six<00:03:49.959> firing<00:03:50.590> groups<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.219> can<00:03:51.430> configure

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
six firing groups that you can configure

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.420 
six firing groups that you can configure
each<00:03:52.209> one<00:03:52.509> map<00:03:52.840> two<00:03:53.079> buttons<00:03:53.409> one<00:03:53.650> through<00:03:54.009> six

each one map two buttons one through six

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.969 
each one map two buttons one through six
your<00:03:55.030> left<00:03:55.329> mouse<00:03:55.599> button<00:03:55.659> does<00:03:56.290> not<00:03:56.530> fire

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
your left mouse button does not fire

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:59.219 
your left mouse button does not fire
group<00:03:57.459> one<00:03:57.790> your<00:03:58.209> left<00:03:58.479> mouse<00:03:58.629> button<00:03:58.689> will

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
group one your left mouse button will

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.899 
group one your left mouse button will
actually<00:03:59.620> fire<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.069> current<00:04:00.400> highlighted

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
actually fire the current highlighted

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.119 
actually fire the current highlighted
group<00:04:01.180> if<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.079> switch<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.620> small<00:04:02.889> laser

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
group if I switch to the small laser

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.559 
group if I switch to the small laser
group<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.790> hit<00:04:03.879> my<00:04:04.030> left<00:04:04.299> mouse<00:04:04.539> button

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
group and hit my left mouse button

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.360 
group and hit my left mouse button
you'll<00:04:05.109> see<00:04:05.199> that<00:04:05.439> it<00:04:05.560> actually<00:04:05.590> fires<00:04:06.129> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
you'll see that it actually fires the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.569 
you'll see that it actually fires the
small<00:04:06.609> laser<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.209> can<00:04:07.900> then<00:04:08.049> use<00:04:08.319> button<00:04:08.709> one<00:04:08.919> to

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
small laser I can then use button one to

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.390 
small laser I can then use button one to
fire<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.060> large<00:04:10.269> lasers<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.769> find<00:04:12.039> button

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
fire the large lasers if you find button

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.640 
fire the large lasers if you find button
one<00:04:12.579> easier<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.239> hit<00:04:13.419> then<00:04:14.199> I<00:04:14.319> would<00:04:14.500> suggest

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
one easier to hit then I would suggest

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.189 
one easier to hit then I would suggest
putting<00:04:15.310> whatever<00:04:15.789> you<00:04:16.060> want<00:04:16.329> onto<00:04:16.659> button

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
putting whatever you want onto button

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.810 
putting whatever you want onto button
one

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
one

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.910 
one
for<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.540> button<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.080> then<00:04:19.260> picking<00:04:19.620> maybe

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
for that button and then picking maybe

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.040 
for that button and then picking maybe
something<00:04:20.280> like<00:04:20.430> group<00:04:20.640> six<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.870> mouse

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
something like group six for mouse

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.560 
something like group six for mouse
button<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.700> make<00:04:23.850> group<00:04:24.090> firing<00:04:24.450> on<00:04:24.540> that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
button one to make group firing on that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.140 
button one to make group firing on that
easier<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.440> actually<00:04:25.920> do<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.760> certain

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
easier I actually do this on certain

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.650 
easier I actually do this on certain

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
groups as I find button six and five to

groups as I find button six and five to
be<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> little<00:04:33.810> more<00:04:34.110> unwieldy<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:35.100> combat<00:04:36.590> well

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
