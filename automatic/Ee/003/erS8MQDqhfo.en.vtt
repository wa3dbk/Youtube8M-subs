00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello and welcome to this roulette 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:10.410
 the recipe of the day is sparkling Var 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.769
 karma for 4 to 6 people 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.509
 we need 24 because omar 66 liters of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 milk 20 centilitres of cream 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.330
 whole liquid a sheet and a half of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.800
 gelatin in this recipe it is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.109
 important to take liquid cream 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 whole and where to put that to bring it down in 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 whipped cream they have to have a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 minimum of grades and put it at 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.109
 refrigerator for it to be well 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 cold 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 if you are caught by the weather but 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.950
 there we have 15 minutes in the freezer before 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 fault and we now put the gelatin to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 soften in cold water and then we go 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.020
 heat the milk in which you go 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 to melt the carambars so for that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.829
 I take a pan with a thick bottom and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.079
 I'm going to just wet her at this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.379
 that I find that it hangs less 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 when the pan a first relay this 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 that I say I put the milk in the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.289
 pan 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 go we'll put the 40 bars in the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.660
 milk is now learning to be 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
 patients to melt and I stir 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.869
 constantly to prevent a catch 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.590
 to the pan sound 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.720
 hu the 40 bars where all melted is left 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 to seduce the mixture must not be 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 too hot and then we'll add the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.869
 softened gelatin I enjoyed it between 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 my hands to actually next to surplus 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
 of water and then I'll add it to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.170
 sweet mixture that must be lukewarm cabbage 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.729
 but especially not boiling because in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 does that remove the powers of regis 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.790
 hasty so now this 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.259
 preparation must cool before that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.420
 we add the whipped cream of the shot me 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.650

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.009
 big world like that to the clothes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.009

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.260
 miss disaster life in the kitchen 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.540
 did not have to do that is to say that I 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.770
 put the cream in the karma hamlet except 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.440
 that it actually I should have 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.080
 gradually incorporate roma cream 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.790
