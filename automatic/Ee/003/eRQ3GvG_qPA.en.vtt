00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hey y'all so it's been four days now we

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.990 
hey y'all so it's been four days now we
meant<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.350> do<00:00:04.470> it<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.680> too<00:00:05.009> much<00:00:05.400> still<00:00:05.819> no

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
meant to do it in too much still no

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
meant to do it in too much still no
longer<00:00:06.509> got<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.750> little<00:00:06.899> busy<00:00:07.370> so<00:00:08.370> now<00:00:08.490> we're

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
longer got a little busy so now we're

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.039 
longer got a little busy so now we're
going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> check<00:00:09.000> our<00:00:09.179> alcohol<00:00:09.750> content<00:00:12.049> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
going to check our alcohol content and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.340 
going to check our alcohol content and
take<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.469> off<00:00:13.740> again<00:00:15.139> make<00:00:16.139> sure<00:00:16.170> you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
take this off again make sure you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.710 
take this off again make sure you
sterilize<00:00:16.949> everything<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.670> usual

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.000 

again<00:00:26.380> use<00:00:26.679> a<00:00:26.710> straw

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.610 

suck<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.790> up

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.979 

you<00:00:37.190> see<00:00:37.520> it<00:00:37.579> enough<00:00:37.910> to<00:00:38.210> make<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.629> little

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
you see it enough to make the little

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:47.009 
you see it enough to make the little
thing<00:00:39.379> float<00:00:43.120> hydrometer<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.269> they<00:00:44.390> go<00:00:44.629> I

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.180 

should<00:00:48.019> be<00:00:48.110> well<00:00:48.469> enough

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.790 

and<00:00:51.550> how<00:00:51.760> we<00:00:51.820> oh<00:00:52.180> I<00:00:52.300> did<00:00:52.719> it<00:00:52.840> was<00:00:53.050> we<00:00:53.230> set<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.620> on

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
and how we oh I did it was we set it on

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.520 
and how we oh I did it was we set it on
the<00:00:53.829> table<00:00:53.980> when<00:00:54.699> we<00:00:54.850> measured<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.539> seemed<00:00:56.410> to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
the table when we measured it seemed to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.350 
the table when we measured it seemed to
work<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.860> best<00:00:57.010> for<00:00:57.190> us<00:00:57.489> so<00:00:57.820> again<00:00:58.059> make<00:00:58.300> sure

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
work the best for us so again make sure

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.450 
work the best for us so again make sure
you<00:00:58.570> have<00:00:58.750> enough<00:00:58.780> dirt<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.739> flow<00:01:02.460> it's

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
you have enough dirt to flow it's

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.100 
you have enough dirt to flow it's
floating<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.269> sit<00:01:04.449> on<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.690> table<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:07.110> want

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
floating and sit on the table you want

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.440 
floating and sit on the table you want
to<00:01:08.259> spin<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.740> again<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:10.090> sure<00:01:10.119> it's<00:01:10.390> not

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
to spin it again make sure it's not

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.770 
to spin it again make sure it's not
touching<00:01:10.840> any<00:01:10.990> sides

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.690 

and<00:01:15.290> see<00:01:15.560> what<00:01:15.770> you're<00:01:15.920> at

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.899 

so<00:01:19.090> point<00:01:19.390> 99<00:01:19.869> for<00:01:20.460> ya<00:01:21.460> so

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.180 

that's<00:01:25.539> more<00:01:26.439> than<00:01:26.499> good

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.270 

so<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.090> our<00:01:30.210> new<00:01:30.630> treatments<00:01:31.280> alright

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so now we got our new treatments alright

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.800 
so now we got our new treatments alright
so<00:01:32.550> we've<00:01:32.730> got<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.060> add<00:01:33.210> our<00:01:33.720> potassium<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.630> we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so we've got to add our potassium and we

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.460 
so we've got to add our potassium and we
want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.290> 18<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> add

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
want to do 18 that and we want to add

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.610 
want to do 18 that and we want to add
our<00:01:40.500> potassium<00:01:41.310> sorbate<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.330> we<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.440> do

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
our potassium sorbate and we want to do

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.510 
our potassium sorbate and we want to do
one<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.000> half<00:01:47.480> of<00:01:48.480> that<00:01:49.460> teaspoons<00:01:50.460> inside

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
one and a half of that teaspoons inside

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.800 
one and a half of that teaspoons inside
they're<00:01:53.520> both<00:01:53.670> teaspoons<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.660> is<00:01:54.900> potassium

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
they're both teaspoons this is potassium

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.880 
they're both teaspoons this is potassium
metabisulfite<00:02:03.230> concerning<00:02:04.230> which<00:02:04.410> bulldog

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
metabisulfite concerning which bulldog

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:20.290 
metabisulfite concerning which bulldog
talking<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.640> loogie

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.930 

so<00:02:20.810> we're<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.410> add<00:02:21.560> one<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.220> half<00:02:22.250> so

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so we're going to add one and a half so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.780 
so we're going to add one and a half so
we<00:02:23.120> need<00:02:23.440> three<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.770> use<00:02:24.950> since<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.550> half

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
we need three to use since I have a half

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.649 
we need three to use since I have a half
a<00:02:25.820> teaspoon

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:43.590 

snakes<00:02:34.659> low<00:02:34.900> level

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:03:01.480 

um

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.970 

potassium<00:03:02.490> metabisulfite<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:04.440> what's<00:03:04.770> going

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
potassium metabisulfite is what's going

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.120 
potassium metabisulfite is what's going
to<00:03:05.040> stop<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.520> yeast<00:03:05.850> from<00:03:06.060> progressing

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
to stop the yeast from progressing

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.090 
to stop the yeast from progressing
potassium<00:03:08.130> sorbate<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.660> preservative<00:03:10.440> it's

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
potassium sorbate is a preservative it's

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.940 
potassium sorbate is a preservative it's
going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.340> make<00:03:11.910> sure<00:03:12.090> no<00:03:12.270> mold<00:03:12.600> gets<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.740> there

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
going to make sure no mold gets in there

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.340 
going to make sure no mold gets in there
and<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.760> think<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.630> something<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
and I think is that something to the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.520 
and I think is that something to the
yeast<00:03:16.590> too<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.190> sure<00:03:17.900> once<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.990> put<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.320> in

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
yeast too I'm sure once you put this in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.780 
yeast too I'm sure once you put this in
here<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.850> need<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.150> start<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.800> pex

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
here you need to start it this is a pex

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.470 
here you need to start it this is a pex
pipe<00:03:24.360> pdx<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:26.070> can<00:03:26.160> get<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.970> one<00:03:27.240> for

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
pipe pdx you can get get this one for

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690 
pipe pdx you can get get this one for
about<00:03:27.630> 3-4<00:03:28.170> hours<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.680> local<00:03:29.040> hardware<00:03:29.370> store

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
about 3-4 hours or local hardware store

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.910 
about 3-4 hours or local hardware store
he<00:03:30.480> sterilized<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:33.020> it's<00:03:34.020> okay<00:03:34.410> put<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.770> in

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
he sterilized it so it's okay put it in

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
he sterilized it so it's okay put it in
here<00:03:35.130> once<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.550> sterilize<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.330> now<00:03:37.020> here's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
here once you sterilize it now here's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.790 
here once you sterilize it now here's
here's<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.370> thing<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:39.330> wait<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.440> little<00:03:40.680> while

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
here's the thing I wait a little while

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.490 
here's the thing I wait a little while
until<00:03:41.670> those<00:03:42.000> nutrients<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> chance<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
until those nutrients have a chance to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.880 
until those nutrients have a chance to
completely<00:03:44.010> start<00:03:44.460> around<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.890> then

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
completely start around in here and then

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.210 
completely start around in here and then
I<00:03:47.190> deal<00:03:47.550> with<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.790> co2<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.050> co2<00:03:49.440> which

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
I deal with the co2 there is co2 which

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.880 
I deal with the co2 there is co2 which
is<00:03:50.640> still<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.000> solution<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:52.050> still<00:03:52.650> in

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
is still in solution or still in

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.770 
is still in solution or still in
suspension<00:03:53.700> however<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.480> say<00:03:54.570> it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
suspension however you want to say it

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.290 
suspension however you want to say it
basically<00:03:55.290> there's<00:03:55.500> co2<00:03:55.740> bubbles<00:03:56.430> still

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
basically there's co2 bubbles still

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.730 
basically there's co2 bubbles still
trapped<00:03:57.570> in<00:03:57.780> here<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.170> got<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.470> get<00:03:58.620> out

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
trapped in here that you got to get out

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.030 
trapped in here that you got to get out
you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.760> do<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.060> two<00:04:00.240> ways<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:01.020> stir<00:04:01.830> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
you can do it two ways you can stir it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.320 
you can do it two ways you can stir it
like<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:04.250> then<00:04:05.250> co2<00:04:05.730> rises<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.750> top

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
like this and then co2 rises to the top

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.300 
like this and then co2 rises to the top
or<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.410> apply<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> vacuum<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:13.310> some

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
or you can apply a vacuum to it some

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.610 
or you can apply a vacuum to it some
people<00:04:14.610> literally<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.330> back<00:04:15.630> in<00:04:15.959> some<00:04:16.320> people

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
people literally is back in some people

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.190 
people literally is back in some people
use<00:04:16.830> vacuum<00:04:17.100> palms<00:04:17.580> some<00:04:18.090> people<00:04:18.480> use<00:04:18.540> you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
use vacuum palms some people use you

the<00:04:28.740> co2<00:04:29.100> is<00:04:29.400> out<00:04:29.670> because<00:04:30.600> when<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.260> bottle

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the co2 is out because when you bottle

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.530 
the co2 is out because when you bottle
it<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:32.310> can't<00:04:32.580> have<00:04:32.760> co2<00:04:33.210> in<00:04:33.720> there<00:04:34.130> or<00:04:35.540> you

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
it you can't have co2 in there or you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.870 
it you can't have co2 in there or you
could<00:04:36.780> explode<00:04:37.260> that's<00:04:37.830> possibility<00:04:38.670> that's

an extreme I highly doubt that would

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.810 
an extreme I highly doubt that would
happen<00:04:41.990> or<00:04:42.990> when<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.650> pour<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:43.980> bottle<00:04:44.520> of

happen or when you pour the bottle of

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.570 
happen or when you pour the bottle of
wine<00:04:45.030> when<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.540> pour<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:45.900> glass<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.350> wine<00:04:46.590> it's

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
wine when you pour a glass of wine it's

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.540 
wine when you pour a glass of wine it's
going<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.790> look<00:04:48.000> like<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.210> beer<00:04:48.980> so<00:04:49.980> however<00:04:50.370> you
