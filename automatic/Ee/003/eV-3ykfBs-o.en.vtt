marble and you fasten your earring hook
to<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> here's<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.449> done<00:00:24.600> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to that so here's how it's done you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
to that so here's how it's done you
start<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.830> piece<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:25.980> straight<00:00:26.310> wire<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
start with a piece of straight wire and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.849 
start with a piece of straight wire and
your<00:00:28.140> round<00:00:28.320> nose<00:00:28.410> pliers<00:00:30.590> first<00:00:31.590> thing<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
your round nose pliers first thing you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.170 
your round nose pliers first thing you
do<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.750> put<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.899> loop<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.489> wire

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.900 

which<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> hook<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.590> fasten<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:43.910> like

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
which we're a hook will fasten to like

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.320 
which we're a hook will fasten to like
that<00:00:46.160> then<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.760> wrap<00:00:48.150> this

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
that then we're going to do is wrap this

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.229 
that then we're going to do is wrap this
tale<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> wire<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.290> itself<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.400> a<00:00:51.000> flat

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
tale of wire around itself in a flat

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
tale of wire around itself in a flat
spiral<00:00:51.600> shape<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.070> grab<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
spiral shape so you grab it like this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
spiral shape so you grab it like this
and<00:00:58.370> start<00:00:59.370> slowly<00:01:00.300> bending<00:01:00.900> the<00:01:01.020> wire<00:01:02.030> around

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and start slowly bending the wire around

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.469 
and start slowly bending the wire around
itself<00:01:04.940> keeping<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.030> flat<00:01:08.180> until<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> wire

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
itself keeping it flat until the wire

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
itself keeping it flat until the wire
starts<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> spiral<00:01:11.899> upwards<00:01:14.420> flat<00:01:15.420> disk<00:01:16.430> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
starts to spiral upwards flat disk this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
starts to spiral upwards flat disk this
is<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.940> rather<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.390> consuming<00:01:18.420> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is going to be rather time consuming so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.999 
is going to be rather time consuming so
you<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you have to have a little bit of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.490 
you have to have a little bit of
patience<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:22.050> when<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.040> done<00:01:23.190> with<00:01:23.430> this

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
patience and when you're done with this

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.570 
patience and when you're done with this
you're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.920> something<00:01:26.160> it<00:01:26.369> looks

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you're going to have something it looks

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.010 
you're going to have something it looks
like<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.479> diameter

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
like this you want to make the diameter

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
like this you want to make the diameter
of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:35.100> spiral<00:01:35.550> just<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.940> little<00:01:36.149> bit<00:01:36.270> less

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of the spiral just a little bit less

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.340 
of the spiral just a little bit less
than<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.780> marble<00:01:37.110> ease<00:01:39.080> then<00:01:40.080> you're<00:01:40.229> going

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
than your marble ease then you're going

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
than your marble ease then you're going
to<00:01:40.410> take<00:01:40.670> wire<00:01:41.670> cutters<00:01:43.640> flip<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.150> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
to take wire cutters flip off the end of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.289 
to take wire cutters flip off the end of
the<00:01:45.299> wire<00:01:46.520> right<00:01:47.520> where<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.820> comes<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the wire right where it comes out of the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
the wire right where it comes out of the
sparta<00:01:49.130> like<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 

and<00:01:54.520> you're<00:01:54.880> also<00:01:55.060> going<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.720> cut<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and you're also going to cut out a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.859 
and you're also going to cut out a
little<00:01:57.460> post<00:01:59.369> in<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.490> middle<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.790> spire

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.710 

so<00:02:04.869> what<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.170> end<00:02:05.320> up<00:02:05.440> with<00:02:07.080> looks<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.259> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.460 

now<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.590> hold<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.780> loop<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> pair<00:02:16.410> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
now you hold the loop of the pair of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.790 
now you hold the loop of the pair of
pliers<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:18.320> you're<00:02:19.320> going<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> slowly

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
pliers like this you're going to slowly

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.520 
pliers like this you're going to slowly
start<00:02:20.100> tugging<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.270> spiral<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.930> little<00:02:22.440> bit

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
start tugging on the spiral a little bit

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.730 
start tugging on the spiral a little bit
of<00:02:22.560> time<00:02:23.660> until<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.930> pull<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> into<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.500> cone

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
of time until you pull it into a cone

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.090 
of time until you pull it into a cone
shape<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:28.140> also<00:02:28.380> requires<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.950> little

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
shape this also requires a little

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.920 
shape this also requires a little
patience<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.760> want<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.000> keep<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> coils<00:02:30.720> as

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
patience you want to keep the coils as

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.490 
patience you want to keep the coils as
evenly<00:02:31.380> spaced<00:02:31.740> as<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.260> see<00:02:34.410> how

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
evenly spaced as you can you can see how

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.650 
evenly spaced as you can you can see how
it's<00:02:34.650> starting<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:35.300> fall<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> cone<00:02:41.660> looks

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's starting to fall in a cone looks

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.030 
it's starting to fall in a cone looks
about<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.080> now<00:02:43.380> we're<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> try<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.860> on

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
about right now we're going to try it on
