00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello everyone in this lesson I will tell you about 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.589
 different kinds 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.440
 shading and feathering as well as good 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.630
 and the correct shading is very important for 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 drawing quality and beautiful works 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.850
 the first square I will shade usual 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.980
 parallel shading it is applied 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.980
 parallel lines on up to any angle 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.700
 the second square I crosshatch 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.070
 shading 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.230
 it is drawn in parallel lines but 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.230
 at different angles in several layers 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.019
 the third square I will shade so 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.579
 called circular hatching are drawn 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.190
 she's circular lines which 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.739
 intertwined with each other she's great 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.769
 suitable for drawing skin and various 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.769
 textural 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
 Well 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.980
 fourth square i'm shading rough 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.770
 shading but for this we need 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.670
 sharpened pencil 'lead' he nazhdachku 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.650
 blades like this 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.790
 this hatching is suitable for drawing 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.270
 some sketches and for painting 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.270
 large areas 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.520
 the last one is a black hatch drawn 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.799
 on soft pencils such as 6b 7b 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.399
 strong push and in various 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.399
 directions 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.790
 so let's get to the shading first method 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.620
 it's light shading and then 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.340
 paper napkin or paper 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.620
 a towel 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.230
 just in a circular motion to rub 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 pencil paper turns out very light 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.040
 and soft feathering 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.300
 the second way of feathering is to feather 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.910
 fingers take your finger and rub 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.550
 she's a pencil at such at such type 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.410
 feathering be careful because 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.450
 fingers can leave greasy marks 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.450
 which you then delete nothing 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.240
 the third way is to shade cotton 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.580
 a cotton swab gives an interesting 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.230
 an effect that can be applied to 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.230
 create any textures 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.560
 the fourth method of shading we apply 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.320
 a tool called 1 bird 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.150
 this is the density of a curled piece of paper with 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.150
 cut off tip 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.970
 so 5 kind of feathering is feathering 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.800
 brush 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.129
 don't need a piece of paper for 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.129
 tweet and on it with a soft pencil 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:59.060
 brush over the pencil and apply 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.590
 on paper i use makeup brush but 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.400
 You can also use actually been 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.280
 other soft brushes can even buy 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.080
 just wide brush in any 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.349
 hardware store the main thing that was 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.349
 furs 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.440
 also in shading can be applied 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.800
 stencil just closes a sheet of paper 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.039
 desired station and around tushuyte 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.039
