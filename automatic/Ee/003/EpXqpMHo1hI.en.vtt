don't know if Facebook was up then but I

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.370 
don't know if Facebook was up then but I
know<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.850> lot<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.570> people<00:04:00.870> saw<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.290> our

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
know that a lot of people saw in our

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.500 
know that a lot of people saw in our
grade<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.040> lot<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.489> how<00:04:03.180> we<00:04:03.239> called

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
grade and a lot of the how we called

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.350 
grade and a lot of the how we called
goodie<00:04:03.780> Goods<00:04:04.019> saw<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.880> we<00:04:06.090> think<00:04:06.239> that
