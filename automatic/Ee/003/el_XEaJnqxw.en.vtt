you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.620 

they<00:01:11.750> don't<00:01:11.930> particularly<00:01:12.710> think<00:01:12.980> of

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
they don't particularly think of

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.340 
they don't particularly think of
something<00:01:14.630> being<00:01:14.810> portrait<00:01:15.530> or

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
something being portrait or

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.460 
something being portrait or
being<00:01:17.620> figured<00:01:18.370> it<00:01:18.490> necessarily<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.990> much<00:01:20.260> as

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
being figured it necessarily as much as

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.490 
being figured it necessarily as much as
it<00:01:20.620> is<00:01:20.790> important<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.909> me

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.040 

to<00:01:24.620> find<00:01:25.190> what's<00:01:25.730> interesting<00:01:26.120> in<00:01:26.780> how<00:01:27.020> I

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
to find what's interesting in how I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.390 
to find what's interesting in how I
represent<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.950> Union

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.240 

it's<00:01:31.030> really<00:01:31.390> more<00:01:31.600> about<00:01:32.250> representation

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
it's really more about representation

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.660 
it's really more about representation
and<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.840> kind<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.440> iconography<00:01:36.040> that<00:01:36.550> I'm

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
and the kind of iconography that I'm

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.630 
and the kind of iconography that I'm
able<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.030> establish<00:01:37.450> in<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.740> representation

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
able to establish in that representation

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.630 
able to establish in that representation
of<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.120> human<00:01:40.240> image<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.100> I<00:01:42.130> don't<00:01:42.400> think

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
of the human image so I don't think

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.280 
of the human image so I don't think
about<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.360> portrait<00:01:43.990> or<00:01:44.410> as<00:01:45.780> figure<00:01:46.780> work

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
about it as portrait or as figure work

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.970 
about it as portrait or as figure work
to<00:01:47.770> be<00:01:47.890> necessarily<00:01:48.580> figured<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.650> or<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.740> any

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
to be necessarily figured in or in any

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.660 
to be necessarily figured in or in any
anything<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.210> becomes<00:01:53.490> captured<00:01:54.490> in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
anything that that becomes captured in

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
anything that that becomes captured in
that<00:01:54.850> way

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that way

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.280 
that way
and<00:01:55.829> more<00:01:56.070> interested<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> larger

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.020 

characterization<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.530> what<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.549> human<00:02:02.820> image

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
characterization of what the human image

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.250 
characterization of what the human image
represents<00:02:04.310> emotive<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.570> very<00:02:06.570> specific<00:02:07.080> way

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
represents emotive the very specific way

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:21.670 
represents emotive the very specific way
but<00:02:07.500> also<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.910> larger<00:02:09.360> brand

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.680 

when<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.160> work<00:02:22.340> from<00:02:22.520> life<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:26.030> important

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
when I work from life and it's important

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.550 
when I work from life and it's important
in<00:02:26.930> my<00:02:27.739> work<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.310> work<00:02:28.640> from<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.560> real

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
in my work that I do work from a real

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.880 
in my work that I do work from a real
experience

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
experience

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 
experience
it<00:02:33.310> has<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> lot<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it has a lot to do with how the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.260 
it has a lot to do with how the
experience<00:02:36.040> itself<00:02:36.959> becomes<00:02:37.959> somehow<00:02:38.560> made

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
experience itself becomes somehow made

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.000 
experience itself becomes somehow made
tangible<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.930> process<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.800> how<00:02:41.980> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
tangible in the process and how that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.040 
tangible in the process and how that
process<00:02:42.370> becomes<00:02:43.120> represented<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.650> page<00:02:44.950> so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
process becomes represented on a page so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.670 
process becomes represented on a page so
so<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.020> thing<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.350> we're<00:02:50.470> left

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
so the the the thing that we're left

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.760 
so the the the thing that we're left
with<00:02:50.950> begins<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.000> feel<00:02:52.270> in<00:02:52.900> many<00:02:53.080> ways<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
with begins to feel in many ways like a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:01.000 
with begins to feel in many ways like a
relic<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:54.580> for<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:57.840> series<00:02:58.840> of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
relic or for like a a series of

relic or for like a a series of

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
of marks that that that become connected

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.899 
of marks that that that become connected
to<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:05.090> selective<00:03:05.810> process<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.250> connected

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
to a selective process that is connected

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.930 
to a selective process that is connected
to<00:03:08.150> country<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.440> believable<00:03:10.010> experience

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
to country and believable experience

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.780 
to country and believable experience
and<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.200> processor<00:03:13.890> at<00:03:14.010> least<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.310> selective

each moment becomes something unexpected

it says to 30th or 40th the second and
it's<00:03:35.580> just<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.850> single<00:03:36.210> moment<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:37.260> manages

it's just a single moment that manages

you<00:04:29.710> know<00:04:29.740> when<00:04:30.070> we<00:04:30.190> draw<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.490> routines<00:04:30.940> what

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you know when we draw on routines what

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.670 
you know when we draw on routines what
it<00:04:31.390> is<00:04:31.560> we're<00:04:32.560> sort<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.800> ultimately<00:04:34.680> connected

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
it is we're sort of ultimately connected

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.070 
it is we're sort of ultimately connected
to<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:36.400> know<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.390> is<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:39.240> way<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.750> way

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
to you know and that is a way of a way

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.800 
to you know and that is a way of a way
of<00:04:41.610> something<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.700> holding<00:04:43.030> on<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.540> something

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
of something up holding on to something

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.190 
of something up holding on to something
that's<00:04:44.170> basically<00:04:44.470> fleeting<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.310> temporary

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
that's basically fleeting and temporary

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.020 
that's basically fleeting and temporary
majority<00:04:47.200> my<00:04:47.320> painting<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:49.470> probably<00:04:50.470> of

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
majority my painting is probably of

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.390 
majority my painting is probably of
people<00:04:52.030> from<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.330> variety<00:04:52.570> of<00:04:56.070> aspects<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.220> life

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
people from a variety of aspects of life

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.210 
people from a variety of aspects of life
so<00:04:58.330> there's<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.870> variety<00:04:59.170> of<00:04:59.530> people<00:04:59.950> that<00:04:59.980> are

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
so there's a variety of people that are

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.070 
so there's a variety of people that are
portrayed<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:03.330> whereas<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.420> my<00:05:04.540> drawing<00:05:04.900> I

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
portrayed and whereas in my drawing I

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.750 
portrayed and whereas in my drawing I
think<00:05:05.260> it's<00:05:05.380> me<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.680> think<00:05:05.920> here<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.310> probably

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
think it's me to think here is probably

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.720 
think it's me to think here is probably
more<00:05:07.440> predominant<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.830> then<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.430> think<00:05:09.580> that

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
more predominant and then I think that

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.960 
more predominant and then I think that
in<00:05:09.910> many<00:05:10.030> ways<00:05:10.120> is<00:05:10.510> connected<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:12.130> idea

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
in many ways is connected to the idea

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
in many ways is connected to the idea
that<00:05:13.360> drawing<00:05:13.900> itself<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.650> somehow<00:05:14.920> rooted<00:05:15.550> in

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
that drawing itself is somehow rooted in

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.370 
that drawing itself is somehow rooted in
in<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.110> human<00:05:17.490> proportion<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.990> way<00:05:20.170> in

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
in the human proportion and the way in

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.740 
in the human proportion and the way in
which<00:05:20.560> we<00:05:20.740> think<00:05:20.920> about<00:05:21.070> proportion<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.120> and

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
which we think about proportion and and

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.950 
which we think about proportion and and
how<00:05:23.050> we<00:05:23.110> understand<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.950> figure<00:05:24.510> as<00:05:25.510> it

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
how we understand the figure as it

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.820 
how we understand the figure as it
becomes<00:05:26.860> a<00:05:27.300> measurement<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.230> world<00:05:29.470> and

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
becomes a measurement to the world and

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.690 
becomes a measurement to the world and
how<00:05:30.640> we<00:05:30.700> see<00:05:31.090> it<00:05:31.980> and<00:05:32.980> it's<00:05:33.160> sort<00:05:33.340> of<00:05:33.430> like

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
how we see it and it's sort of like

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.380 
how we see it and it's sort of like
purest<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:35.169> sapiens<00:05:36.040> work<00:05:36.220> here<00:05:36.490> but<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.270> way

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
purest you sapiens work here but the way

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.550 
purest you sapiens work here but the way
we<00:05:37.560> understand<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.680> figure<00:05:39.070> as<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:40.410> just<00:05:41.410> think

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
we understand the figure as I just think

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.110 
we understand the figure as I just think
you<00:05:41.620> have<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.830> draw<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.460> understand<00:05:42.940> the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
you have to draw it to understand the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.409 
you have to draw it to understand the
figure<00:05:43.480> to<00:05:43.720> me<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.650> comes

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
figure to me it comes

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.830 
figure to me it comes
almost<00:05:47.379> like<00:05:47.469> an<00:05:47.620> exercise<00:05:48.150> for<00:05:49.150> my<00:05:49.360> painting

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
almost like an exercise for my painting

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.159 
almost like an exercise for my painting
or<00:05:50.110> or<00:05:50.439> for<00:05:50.650> my<00:05:50.770> other<00:05:50.919> work<00:05:51.569> so<00:05:52.569> I<00:05:52.599> think<00:05:52.750> about

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
or or for my other work so I think about

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.809 
or or for my other work so I think about
my<00:05:53.349> drawing<00:05:53.680> in<00:05:54.009> that<00:05:54.219> way<00:05:54.430> not<00:05:54.460> necessarily

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
my drawing in that way not necessarily

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.529 
my drawing in that way not necessarily
that's<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.719> main<00:05:55.960> thing<00:05:56.289> in<00:05:56.949> my<00:05:57.159> work<00:05:57.400> but<00:05:57.759> but

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
that's the main thing in my work but but

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.649 
that's the main thing in my work but but
as<00:05:58.750> sort<00:05:59.349> of<00:05:59.409> a<00:05:59.939> prerequisite<00:06:00.939> in<00:06:01.120> many<00:06:01.419> ways

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
as sort of a prerequisite in many ways

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.379 
as sort of a prerequisite in many ways
to<00:06:02.080> what<00:06:02.319> it<00:06:02.439> is<00:06:02.560> that<00:06:02.919> I'm<00:06:03.280> ultimately<00:06:03.490> after

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
to what it is that I'm ultimately after

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.350 
to what it is that I'm ultimately after
in<00:06:04.629> some<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.740> more<00:06:06.009> complex<00:06:06.849> larger

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
in some of the more complex larger

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.839 
in some of the more complex larger
paintings<00:06:07.949> know<00:06:08.949> what<00:06:09.280> I<00:06:09.310> mean<00:06:09.490> but<00:06:09.669> what<00:06:09.789> I

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
paintings know what I mean but what I

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.279 
paintings know what I mean but what I
mean<00:06:10.000> by<00:06:10.120> proportion<00:06:10.780> it<00:06:11.020> doesn't

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
mean by proportion it doesn't

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.170 
mean by proportion it doesn't
necessarily<00:06:11.889> mean<00:06:12.069> well<00:06:12.250> if<00:06:12.550> it<00:06:12.669> hits<00:06:12.819> too<00:06:12.969> big

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
necessarily mean well if it hits too big

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.869 
necessarily mean well if it hits too big
if<00:06:13.360> it's<00:06:13.629> too<00:06:13.780> small<00:06:14.050> it's<00:06:14.409> a<00:06:14.590> bit<00:06:14.770> but<00:06:15.400> it's

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
if it's too small it's a bit but it's

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.309 
if it's too small it's a bit but it's
the<00:06:16.090> way<00:06:16.240> in<00:06:16.509> which<00:06:16.719> I<00:06:16.900> think<00:06:17.110> about

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
the way in which I think about

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.700 
the way in which I think about
measurement<00:06:18.039> of<00:06:18.310> shapes<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:19.169> and<00:06:20.169> how<00:06:20.439> those

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
measurement of shapes and and how those

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.089 
measurement of shapes and and how those
shapes<00:06:21.039> as<00:06:21.370> forms<00:06:21.969> are<00:06:22.770> are<00:06:23.849> understood<00:06:25.889> in<00:06:26.889> my

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
shapes as forms are are understood in my

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.570 
shapes as forms are are understood in my
representation<00:06:27.879> of<00:06:28.270> an<00:06:28.689> image<00:06:29.340> example<00:06:30.340> would

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
representation of an image example would

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.189 
representation of an image example would
be<00:06:30.610> if<00:06:30.939> you<00:06:31.180> were<00:06:31.599> to<00:06:31.719> paint<00:06:31.900> let's<00:06:32.110> say

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
be if you were to paint let's say

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.929 
be if you were to paint let's say
landscape<00:06:32.800> as<00:06:32.979> soon<00:06:33.129> as<00:06:33.219> you<00:06:33.310> put<00:06:33.550> human

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939 
landscape as soon as you put human

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.240 
landscape as soon as you put human
figure<00:06:34.300> against<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.199> tree<00:06:35.469> then<00:06:36.069> we

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
figure against the tree then we

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.309 
figure against the tree then we
understand<00:06:36.849> the<00:06:37.029> scale<00:06:37.300> of<00:06:37.539> the<00:06:37.629> tree<00:06:37.949> so

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
understand the scale of the tree so

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.490 
understand the scale of the tree so
unconsciously<00:06:41.349> we<00:06:42.039> we<00:06:42.669> as<00:06:42.849> human<00:06:43.150> beings

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
unconsciously we we as human beings

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.240 
unconsciously we we as human beings
identify<00:06:44.500> and<00:06:45.360> envision<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:46.689> world<00:06:47.250> because

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
identify and envision the world because

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.519 
identify and envision the world because
of<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.610> way<00:06:48.759> we<00:06:48.939> understand<00:06:49.509> our<00:06:49.750> proportion

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:50.529 
of the way we understand our proportion

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:51.890 
of the way we understand our proportion
against<00:06:51.099> it

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
against it

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.439 
against it
so<00:06:52.900> so<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.949> has<00:06:54.159> so<00:06:54.490> much<00:06:54.639> to<00:06:54.819> do<00:06:54.969> with<00:06:55.180> the

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
so so that has so much to do with the

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.719 
so so that has so much to do with the
reason<00:06:55.900> for<00:06:56.110> drawing<00:06:56.379> and<00:06:56.560> painting<00:06:56.770> thank

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
reason for drawing and painting thank

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.820 
reason for drawing and painting thank
you<00:06:57.879> for<00:06:58.599> me<00:06:58.719> is<00:06:59.050> that<00:06:59.830> it<00:07:00.099> somehow<00:07:00.639> begins<00:07:01.270> to

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
you for me is that it somehow begins to

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.529 
you for me is that it somehow begins to
become

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.210 

kind<00:07:06.539> of<00:07:06.599> a<00:07:06.690> connection<00:07:07.289> that<00:07:07.740> begins<00:07:08.069> to

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
kind of a connection that begins to

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.659 
kind of a connection that begins to
connect<00:07:08.639> it<00:07:09.270> on<00:07:09.509> a<00:07:09.840> deeper<00:07:10.199> level<00:07:10.229> how<00:07:11.039> I<00:07:11.400> can

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
connect it on a deeper level how I can
