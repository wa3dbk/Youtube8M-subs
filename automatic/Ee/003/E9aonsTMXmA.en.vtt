right a middle and a left 0 on the left
side<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.710> give<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.190> overwatch

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
side there's give me like an overwatch

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
side there's give me like an overwatch
on<00:00:51.059> each<00:00:51.300> corner<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.020> an<00:00:52.140> overwatch<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
on each corner is like an overwatch and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
on each corner is like an overwatch and
the<00:00:53.250> flags<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.969> opposite<00:00:54.300> corners<00:00:54.510> then

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the flags are on opposite corners then

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
the flags are on opposite corners then
be<00:00:54.989> flag<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> directly<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> center<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

like<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> snow<00:01:25.860> map<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.180> element<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like the snow map the the element on it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
like the snow map the the element on it
is<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.549> kind<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
is like there's like a some kind of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.130 
is like there's like a some kind of
avalanche<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.420> something<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> ice

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
avalanche or something like the ice

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
avalanche or something like the ice
breaks<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> falls<00:01:32.040> apart<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.700> end<00:01:32.850> up

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
breaks and falls apart you can end up

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.420 
breaks and falls apart you can end up
dying<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.290> creates<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.950> iceberg

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
dying and it creates like an iceberg

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
dying and it creates like an iceberg
that<00:01:35.670> floats<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> water<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.810> can

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that floats out in the water you can

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.800 
that floats out in the water you can
jump<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.500> hide<00:01:37.710> out<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:39.090> initial<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
jump on and hide out there my initial of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
jump on and hide out there my initial of
pain<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> map<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:42.180> bad

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
pain of the map was is very very bad

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
pain of the map was is very very bad
it's<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.229> blocky<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
it's very blocky as in like there's just

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.630 
it's very blocky as in like there's just
like<00:01:45.329> shit<00:01:45.750> everywhere<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> map<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
like shit everywhere on the map like

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.179 
like shit everywhere on the map like
it's<00:01:47.820> hard<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.540> hard<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> find<00:01:49.380> kills<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
it's hard to see hard to find kills and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.639 
it's hard to see hard to find kills and
it's<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:51.030> long<00:01:51.540> from<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.259> notice<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's very long from what I notice it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's very long from what I notice it
takes<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.070> while<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.579> across<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.180> map

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
takes a while to get across the map

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.770 
takes a while to get across the map
there's<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.280> gun<00:01:56.700> fight

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
there's no really like good gun fight

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
there's no really like good gun fight
angles<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:59.040> just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
angles like it's just like there's just

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
angles like it's just like there's just
shit<00:01:59.610> everywhere<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.960> lily<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
shit everywhere like lily and like it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
shit everywhere like lily and like it's
just<00:02:02.790> hard<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.750> across<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.259> map

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
just hard to you know see across the map

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.429 
just hard to you know see across the map
and<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.719> cool<00:02:06.990> there's<00:02:07.320> no

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and it's it's kind of cool there's no

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.990 
and it's it's kind of cool there's no
hitting<00:02:07.680> kill<00:02:07.920> streak<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.280> could<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.819> on

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
hitting kill streak that I could see on

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.140 
hitting kill streak that I could see on
the<00:02:09.090> map<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.050> decent<00:02:10.530> map

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the map it's a decent map

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.880 
the map it's a decent map
like<00:02:11.299> I<00:02:11.510> would<00:02:11.750> not<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:11.959> would<00:02:12.290> probably<00:02:12.530> give

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
like I would not I would probably give

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.479 
it like a 3 out of 10 if I had to the
third<00:02:15.319> map<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.769> want<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.010> talk<00:02:16.129> about<00:02:16.159> is

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
third map I want to talk about is

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.539 
third map I want to talk about is
Overlord<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.540> has<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.959> cool<00:02:18.260> map<00:02:18.560> element<00:02:19.099> it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
a very cool map element this map very

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.550 
a very cool map element this map very
very<00:02:40.609> very<00:02:41.120> spawned<00:02:41.569> on<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.079> first<00:02:42.290> time<00:02:42.409> I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
very very spawned on it the first time I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.009 
very very spawned on it the first time I
played<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:43.129> was<00:02:43.310> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.909> weird<00:02:44.090> map<00:02:44.269> it

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
played it was kind of a weird map it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.379 
played it was kind of a weird map it
reminds<00:02:45.470> me<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:46.190> black<00:02:46.519> ops<00:02:46.730> 2<00:02:47.000> DLC

map<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.629> think<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.959> called<00:02:48.139> mirage<00:02:48.530> but

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
map I think it's called mirage but

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.009 
map I think it's called mirage but
basically<00:02:49.670> well<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.359> play<00:02:50.569> uplink<00:02:50.900> on

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.089 
spawn trapping this map pretty hard like
they<00:02:56.299> will<00:02:56.689> literally<00:02:57.079> spawn<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.950> your

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
they will literally spawn in your

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.589 
they will literally spawn in your
reticle<00:02:58.519> when<00:02:58.730> you're<00:02:58.879> in<00:02:58.970> their<00:02:59.120> face<00:02:59.329> you

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
reticle when you're in their face you

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.910 
reticle when you're in their face you
just<00:02:59.629> like<00:02:59.930> sit<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.409> of<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> corner<00:03:00.889> of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
just like sit in one of the corner of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.559 
just like sit in one of the corner of
the<00:03:01.040> spawns<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.579> can<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:01.909> pretty<00:03:02.120> much<00:03:02.269> kill

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
the spawns you can just pretty much kill

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.390 
the spawns you can just pretty much kill
them<00:03:02.720> off<00:03:02.900> their<00:03:03.139> spawn<00:03:03.439> every<00:03:03.950> single<00:03:04.220> time

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
them off their spawn every single time

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.309 
them off their spawn every single time
so<00:03:04.549> it's<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.730> very<00:03:04.760> spawn<00:03:05.209> down<00:03:05.510> at<00:03:05.720> map<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
so it's a very spawn down at map and the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.009 
so it's a very spawn down at map and the
last<00:03:06.650> map<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.280> quarantine<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.389> just<00:03:08.870> an

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
last map is quarantine it's just an

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.170 
last map is quarantine it's just an
awful<00:03:09.139> map<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.829> it's<00:03:10.099> probably<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.909> worst

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
awful map that it's probably the worst

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.000 
awful map that it's probably the worst
it's<00:03:11.480> definitely<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.019> worst<00:03:12.290> map<00:03:12.590> out<00:03:12.829> of<00:03:12.920> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it's definitely the worst map out of the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.890 
it's definitely the worst map out of the
map<00:03:13.220> pack<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.609> give<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.939> a<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.150> 0<00:03:14.629> out<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:14.840> 10

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
map pack I give it a little 0 out of 10

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500 
map pack I give it a little 0 out of 10
is<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.829> map<00:03:16.069> itself<00:03:16.280> it's<00:03:16.879> reminds<00:03:17.359> me<00:03:17.480> a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
is the map itself it's reminds me a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.080 
is the map itself it's reminds me a
fracture<00:03:18.169> like<00:03:18.349> it's<00:03:18.560> super<00:03:19.099> complex<00:03:19.730> like

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
fracture like it's super complex like

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.059 
fracture like it's super complex like
the<00:03:20.269> dynamics<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.139> map<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:21.590> it's<00:03:21.769> just

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
the dynamics of the map and it's just

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.250 
the dynamics of the map and it's just
not<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.459> good<00:03:22.489> map<00:03:23.030> for<00:03:23.329> winning<00:03:23.569> gunfights<00:03:24.049> my

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
not a good map for winning gunfights my

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.479 
not a good map for winning gunfights my
personal<00:03:24.650> pain<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:24.919> maps<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.430> are

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
personal pain I like maps that are

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.729 
personal pain I like maps that are
arena-style<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:26.720> map<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:26.959> just<00:03:27.349> not<00:03:27.530> a

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
arena-style and this map is just not a

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.649 
arena-style and this map is just not a
good<00:03:27.980> map<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.489> mean<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.239> that's<00:03:29.389> pretty

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
good map I mean that and that's pretty

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.990 
good map I mean that and that's pretty
much<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.379> I've<00:03:30.859> played<00:03:31.129> all<00:03:31.340> four<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
much it like I've played all four of the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.330 
much it like I've played all four of the
maps<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.480> lot<00:03:32.900> like<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:33.470> said<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> only<00:03:33.980> DNA<00:03:34.129> mom

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
maps a lot like I said the only DNA mom

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.030 
maps a lot like I said the only DNA mom
I<00:03:34.430> got<00:03:34.609> was<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.879> swarm<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.989> one<00:03:36.260> bonus<00:03:36.829> to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I got was on swarm and the one bonus to

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.969 
I got was on swarm and the one bonus to
add<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> warm<00:03:37.699> is<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.269> DLC<00:03:39.079> part<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.799> is

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
add a warm is the DLC part of it is

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.420 
add a warm is the DLC part of it is
there<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.430> swarm<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.769> humongous<00:03:42.769> negative

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
there a swarm but the humongous negative

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.640 
there a swarm but the humongous negative
is<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.639> terrible<00:03:44.569> terrible<00:03:44.900> killstreak<00:03:45.470> you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
is the terrible terrible killstreak you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.589 
is the terrible terrible killstreak you
have<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.919> control<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.609> which<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.449> worst

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
have to control it which is the worst

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.869 
have to control it which is the worst
part<00:03:47.870> about<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.560> doesn't<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.519> flyer

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
part about and it doesn't you know flyer

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.789 
part about and it doesn't you know flyer
it's<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.389> real<00:03:50.569> swarm<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:51.500> kind<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.709> like

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
it's like a real swarm it's kind of like

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.979 
it's like a real swarm it's kind of like
a<00:03:51.889> beehive<00:03:52.190> thing<00:03:52.729> and<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.389> just<00:03:53.659> like<00:03:53.840> I

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
a beehive thing and it's just like I

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.449 
a beehive thing and it's just like I
just<00:03:54.079> don't<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.709> killstreak<00:03:55.129> the<00:03:55.280> map

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
just don't like the killstreak the map

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.890 
just don't like the killstreak the map
is<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.790> best<00:03:55.970> one<00:03:56.120> out<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.449> map<00:03:56.629> pack

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
is the best one out of the map pack

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.990 
is the best one out of the map pack
without<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.680> doubt<00:03:57.979> and<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:58.400> you're<00:03:58.549> comparing

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
without a doubt and if you're comparing

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.849 
without a doubt and if you're comparing
this<00:03:59.150> map<00:03:59.419> pack<00:03:59.659> the<00:03:59.840> last<00:04:00.079> map<00:04:00.319> pack<00:04:00.590> it

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
this map pack the last map pack it

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.099 
this map pack the last map pack it
definitely<00:04:01.370> losses<00:04:02.180> without<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.629> doubt<00:04:02.900> in<00:04:03.019> my

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
definitely losses without a doubt in my

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.839 
definitely losses without a doubt in my
mind<00:04:03.290> last<00:04:03.500> map<00:04:03.799> pack<00:04:04.010> was<00:04:04.220> amazing<00:04:04.729> my

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
mind last map pack was amazing my

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.729 
mind last map pack was amazing my
opinion<00:04:05.209> this<00:04:05.750> map<00:04:05.989> pack<00:04:06.169> definitely

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
opinion this map pack definitely

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.439 
opinion this map pack definitely
disappoints<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:07.669> that's<00:04:08.000> pretty<00:04:08.209> much<00:04:08.329> it

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
disappoints but that's pretty much it

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.879 
disappoints but that's pretty much it
hopefully<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.079> guys<00:04:09.139> enjoyed<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.590> video<00:04:09.709> if

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.349 
hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if
you<00:04:10.069> did<00:04:10.099> make<00:04:10.430> sure<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.609> guys<00:04:10.699> leave<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:10.940> light

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
you did make sure you guys leave a light

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.119 
you did make sure you guys leave a light
and<00:04:11.599> that's<00:04:11.780> pretty<00:04:11.989> much<00:04:12.109> it<00:04:12.229> have<00:04:12.889> a<00:04:12.949> good

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129
