00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 match begins how many predictions was 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:30.449
 regarding its outcome but it was all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:34.879
 the house is now just a miracle game but there is 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.879
 couple not captcha 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
 maximus 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 I want such things you can not forgive dangerous 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.020
 attack of course the dream of any team 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.900
 Emission hitters develop from boy 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 match and now the coach of this team I 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.610
 I feel like a person who 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.789
 We fulfilled all the most important dreams of his 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.220
 there is an awesome attack line he's a lot 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.170
 they say 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.660
 in an interview because guys 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.190
 really deserve attention this 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.190
 real stars 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.840
 need to break into the operating room 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.840
 good interception 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.179
 exchanged without trays 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.269
 want 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.190
 for transmission 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.060
 yes not hit the ball flies toward the people 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.840
 not bad but by 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.290
 but this guy will turn out to be a good bass 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.690
 the ball is intercepted 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.900
 are attacking 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.269
 have they swore 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.190
 Mrs. Gabbins 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.000
 tanks 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 tanks 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.340
 Well, in the first half, excellent 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.010
 delivered both teams lend an account already 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.230
 repeatedly be changed if 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.989
 a team with a big ball 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.400
 part of the game in the first half 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.670
 imagined that with this sword you need 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.500
 take a break and the team diverge by 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.500
 vacation score 0 0 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.780
 ordinary game in the second half is not enough 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.530
 different from what was happening in 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.530
 first 45 minutes 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.440
 snipe food 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.550
 but 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.910
 the ball flies to flank 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.440
 quarterback beats the ball over his mates 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.800
 have time to rearrange the soft color on 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.800
 wing 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.450
 and you are competent translation 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.320
 good luck such a vague feeling that now 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.320
 attacker to change 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.550
 the judge shows the yellow card further 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.550
 need to be more attentive to this player 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:31.930
 the player gives the ball on the flank of stretching 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:31.930
 line of defense without paws 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.310
 because of the side throwing year ball 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.020
 began abruptly 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.020
 there is but 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.100
 Not bad 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.830
 jesus kbs 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:15.699
 shifter 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.389
 the team plays widely well uses 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.389
 flank 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.300
 very and 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.250
 assigned a corner kick 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.810
 not body weight on 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.810
 resistor 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.979
 very slowly developing attack 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.520
 from this position you can take 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.520
 aggravation 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.240
 very favorable position 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.620
 great pass 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.930
 very awkwardly this is an awkward struggle for 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.930
 ball referee could show the card 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:56.690
 brilliant site goalkeeper 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.270
 the whistle sounds like what are we today 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:02.979
 have seen a real fight head- on shoulder 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.979
 shoulder bone bone
