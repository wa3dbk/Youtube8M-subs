00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.580 
opinion a lot of people aren't a fan of
it<00:01:21.920> because<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.760> very<00:01:22.970> weird<00:01:23.390> intamin<00:01:24.170> it

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
it because it's a very weird intamin it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.899 
doesn't have airtime Hills where the
straight<00:01:27.409> sections<00:01:27.950> are<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.220> got<00:01:28.370> those<00:01:28.550> two

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
straight sections are it's got those two

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.719 
straight sections are it's got those two
large<00:01:29.330> helixes<00:01:30.080> however<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.800> like<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.430> it's

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
large helixes however I like it it's

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.480 
large helixes however I like it it's
very<00:01:31.850> fast<00:01:32.570> as<00:01:32.870> a<00:01:32.900> good<00:01:33.260> drop<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.770> airtime<00:01:34.310> is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
very fast as a good drop the airtime is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.430 
very fast as a good drop the airtime is
good<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.940> those<00:01:35.090> straight<00:01:35.570> sections<00:01:36.080> are<00:01:36.229> fun

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
good and those straight sections are fun

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.230 
good and those straight sections are fun
it's<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.680> great<00:01:36.830> time<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.310> just<00:01:37.490> let<00:01:37.760> your<00:01:37.909> hands

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
it's a great time to just let your hands

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.719 
it's a great time to just let your hands
fly<00:01:38.690> through<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.140> air<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.620> I<00:01:39.979> think<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.460> was

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
fly through the air and I think it was

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.700 
fly through the air and I think it was
very<00:01:41.150> well<00:01:41.479> done<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.229> why<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.500> takes

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
very well done so that is why it takes

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.340 
very well done so that is why it takes
