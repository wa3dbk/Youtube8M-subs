00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is it underrated I have no idea I have a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
is it underrated I have no idea I have a
feeling<00:01:22.729> most<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> Bachman<00:01:24.450> books<00:01:24.689> are

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
feeling most of the Bachman books are

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.760 
feeling most of the Bachman books are
just<00:01:25.080> flat-out

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
just flat-out

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
just flat-out
underrated<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> fact<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
underrated just because the fact that

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
underrated just because the fact that
it's<00:01:28.470> done<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.340> Stephen<00:01:29.729> King's<00:01:29.970> pseudonym

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

it's done by Stephen King's pseudonym
Richard<00:01:31.380> Bachman<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.210> guessing<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
Richard Bachman I'm guessing that's the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.770 
Richard Bachman I'm guessing that's the
reason<00:01:34.229> why<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.790> sad<00:01:36.119> reason<00:01:36.390> but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
reason why it's pretty sad reason but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.819 
reason why it's pretty sad reason but
people<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:38.329> care<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:40.409> people

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
people just don't care I think people

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
people just don't care I think people
just<00:01:40.860> need<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> message<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.540> Stephen
