00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
be completely hectic but would make it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.309 
be completely hectic but would make it
better<00:01:44.039> than<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.520> 12<00:01:45.090> verses<00:01:45.479> 12<00:01:45.780> capture<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
better than the 12 verses 12 capture the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right on both counts there it does make

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
right on both counts there it does make
it<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> hell<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> lot<00:01:50.759> more<00:01:50.789> fun<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:51.390> it's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it a hell of a lot more fun but it's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.929 
it a hell of a lot more fun but it's
completely<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.289> utterly<00:01:52.500> mental<00:01:53.460> there's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
completely and utterly mental there's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
completely and utterly mental there's
just<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.329> many<00:01:54.539> players<00:01:54.840> running<00:01:55.170> around<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
just so many players running around the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
just so many players running around the
map<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.340> easy<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.880> roadkill's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
map that it's so easy to get roadkill's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.609 
map that it's so easy to get roadkill's
but<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.719> easy<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.140> hit<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.530> RPG

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
but it's easy to get hit with an RPG

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.529 
but it's easy to get hit with an RPG
when<00:01:59.250> you're<00:01:59.369> trying<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> drive<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.149> person

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and then you get shot from behind as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.279 
and then you get shot from behind as
well<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.909> Scout<00:02:03.180> helis<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.840> got<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
well the Scout helis have just got so

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.959 
well the Scout helis have just got so
many<00:02:04.590> targets<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.549> take<00:02:05.729> out

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
many targets that they could take out

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
many targets that they could take out
it's<00:02:06.390> sort<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.930> pick<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> mix<00:02:07.530> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's sort of like pick and mix really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's sort of like pick and mix really
but<00:02:08.489> enough<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.820> capture<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.149> flag<00:02:09.239> now<00:02:09.660> we're

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
flag layout is different obviously

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.610

you've<00:02:17.519> got<00:02:17.640> seven<00:02:18.000> flags<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.600> PC<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.019> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
you've got seven flags here on PC and I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440 
you've got seven flags here on PC and I
just<00:02:19.799> find<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.220> because<00:02:21.120> there<00:02:21.299> are<00:02:21.420> more

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just find that because there are more

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
just find that because there are more
players<00:02:21.870> there's<00:02:22.230> more<00:02:22.440> ways<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.680> utilize<00:02:23.070> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
players there's more ways to utilize the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.370 
players there's more ways to utilize the
vehicles<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.239> more<00:02:24.510> ways<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.720> utilize<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
vehicles as more ways to utilize the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.960 
vehicles as more ways to utilize the
buildings<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> different<00:02:26.579> bases

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
buildings and all the different bases

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.699 
buildings and all the different bases
and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.630> build<00:02:27.780> different<00:02:28.049> strategies

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and you can build different strategies

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.560 
and you can build different strategies
just<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.640> more<00:02:29.970> people<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
just because you have more people on the

just because you have more people on the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

between it let's put it in terms of DLCs
its<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.760> mix<00:03:05.000> between<00:03:05.180> aftermath<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.170> armored

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800

endgame<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.630> by<00:03:35.750> combining<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.349> maps<00:03:36.530> by

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
endgame but by combining the maps by

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.050 
endgame but by combining the maps by
making<00:03:36.980> them<00:03:37.040> slightly<00:03:37.340> smaller<00:03:37.760> than<00:03:37.849> what

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
making them slightly smaller than what

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.690 
making them slightly smaller than what
they<00:03:38.180> would<00:03:38.360> be<00:03:38.569> for<00:03:38.840> armored<00:03:39.170> kill<00:03:39.410> and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
they would be for armored kill and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
they would be for armored kill and
integrating<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.819> Scout<00:03:41.060> helis<00:03:41.420> as<00:03:41.510> being

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
integrating the Scout helis as being

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.690 
integrating the Scout helis as being
quite<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.049> sort<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.440> integral<00:03:43.010> part<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.430> map

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
quite a sort of integral part of the map

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.050 
quite a sort of integral part of the map
really<00:03:44.180> along<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.989> lightweight<00:03:45.379> AAS<00:03:45.769> I

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
really along with the lightweight AAS I

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.430 
really along with the lightweight AAS I
think<00:03:47.060> dice<00:03:47.269> have<00:03:47.510> pretty<00:03:47.720> much<00:03:47.780> nailed<00:03:48.230> this

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
think dice have pretty much nailed this

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.460 
think dice have pretty much nailed this

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
that I've noticed for PC as well

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.729 
that I've noticed for PC as well
operation<00:03:53.450> Riverside<00:03:53.870> it's<00:03:54.140> not<00:03:54.379> as<00:03:54.500> popular

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
operation Riverside it's not as popular

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.759 
operation Riverside it's not as popular
as<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.190> was<00:03:55.459> on<00:03:55.489> ps3<00:03:55.970> I'm<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:57.170> really<00:03:57.319> sure<00:03:57.410> why

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
as it was on ps3 I'm not really sure why

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.860 
as it was on ps3 I'm not really sure why
that<00:03:57.799> is<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.340> mean<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:58.700> quite<00:03:58.910> open<00:03:59.420> but<00:03:59.720> it's

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
that is I mean it's quite open but it's

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.479 
that is I mean it's quite open but it's
not<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.230> open<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.739> some<00:04:00.889> of<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.100> other<00:04:01.130> maps

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
not as open to some of the other maps

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.789 
not as open to some of the other maps
and<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.790> doesn't<00:04:02.120> really<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:03.319> me<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.590> doesn't

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
and it doesn't really to me it doesn't

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.590 
and it doesn't really to me it doesn't
really<00:04:04.040> feel<00:04:04.160> like<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:04.639> conquest<00:04:05.090> map<00:04:05.329> because

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
really feel like a conquest map because

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.300 
really feel like a conquest map because
it's<00:04:05.780> quite<00:04:06.019> narrow<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.739> it's<00:04:06.950> built<00:04:07.190> around

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it's quite narrow and it's built around

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.550 
it's quite narrow and it's built around
the<00:04:07.670> river<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.329> works<00:04:08.630> better<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:09.139> rush<00:04:09.319> and

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the river it works better for rush and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.020 
the river it works better for rush and
capture<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:09.920> flag<00:04:10.130> which<00:04:10.430> i<00:04:10.549> guess<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.760> why

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
capture the flag which i guess is why

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.699 
capture the flag which i guess is why
people<00:04:11.420> don't<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.810> playing<00:04:12.049> it<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.290> conquest

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709

people don't like playing it on conquest
and<00:04:13.069> I<00:04:13.519> actually<00:04:13.730> go<00:04:14.030> into<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.269> situation<00:04:14.450> where

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
and I actually go into a situation where

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.569 
and I actually go into a situation where
people<00:04:15.139> complaining<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.829> much<00:04:15.889> in<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.340> chat

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
people complaining so much in the chat

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.610 
people complaining so much in the chat
that<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> server<00:04:17.450> admin<00:04:17.840> actually<00:04:18.109> restarted

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that the server admin actually restarted

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.170 
that the server admin actually restarted
the<00:04:18.709> server<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.190> put<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.430> onto<00:04:19.579> another<00:04:19.910> one

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
the server and put it onto another one

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.510 
the server and put it onto another one
of<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.359> endgame<00:04:20.690> maps<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.229> all<00:04:21.889> my<00:04:22.099> god<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
of the endgame maps and all my god the

dirt<00:04:22.729> bikes<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.270> PC<00:04:23.630> are<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.050> much<00:04:24.289> fun<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.710> think

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
dirt bikes on PC are so much fun I think

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.010 
dirt bikes on PC are so much fun I think
I<00:04:25.190> jumped<00:04:25.430> into<00:04:25.550> a<00:04:25.639> server<00:04:25.880> we<00:04:26.120> all<00:04:26.270> started<00:04:26.810> in

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
I jumped into a server we all started in

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.110 
I jumped into a server we all started in
our<00:04:27.200> own<00:04:27.349> base<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.830> five<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.580> us<00:04:28.610> all<00:04:28.849> hopped

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
our own base and five of us all hopped

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.490 
our own base and five of us all hopped
onto<00:04:29.300> dirt<00:04:29.570> bikes<00:04:29.810> at<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:29.990> same<00:04:30.139> time<00:04:30.289> all

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
onto dirt bikes at the same time all

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.680 
onto dirt bikes at the same time all
raced<00:04:30.860> out<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.370> it<00:04:31.700> just<00:04:31.880> felt<00:04:32.090> such<00:04:32.330> an<00:04:32.510> epic

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
raced out and it just felt such an epic

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.779 
raced out and it just felt such an epic
battle<00:04:33.050> field<00:04:33.470> moment<00:04:33.860> or<00:04:33.979> racing<00:04:34.430> out<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
battle field moment or racing out of the

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.029 
battle field moment or racing out of the
deployment<00:04:35.660> on<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.110> back<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.289> dirt<00:04:36.590> bikes<00:04:36.889> I

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
deployment on the back of dirt bikes I

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.110 
deployment on the back of dirt bikes I
think<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.220> couple<00:04:37.250> of<00:04:37.580> them<00:04:37.669> fired<00:04:37.910> like

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
think a couple of them fired like

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.540 
think a couple of them fired like
celebratory<00:04:38.660> RPGs<00:04:39.470> into<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> air<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.400> was

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
celebratory RPGs into the air it was

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.400 
celebratory RPGs into the air it was
brilliant<00:04:40.789> fun<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.690> dirt<00:04:41.900> bikes<00:04:42.139> on<00:04:42.289> this

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
brilliant fun and the dirt bikes on this

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.320 
brilliant fun and the dirt bikes on this
are<00:04:42.530> actually<00:04:42.860> really<00:04:43.070> about<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.090> good

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
are actually really about the so good

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.480 
are actually really about the so good
there's<00:04:44.539> so<00:04:44.690> much<00:04:44.840> fun<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.860> all<00:04:46.039> I<00:04:46.070> can<00:04:46.340> really

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
there's so much fun so all I can really

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.159 
there's so much fun so all I can really
say<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.820> if<00:04:47.060> you've<00:04:47.210> got<00:04:47.360> battlefield<00:04:47.690> 3<00:04:48.020> for

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
say is if you've got battlefield 3 for

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.290 
say is if you've got battlefield 3 for
pc<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.889> don't<00:04:49.130> have<00:04:49.340> premium<00:04:49.610> but<00:04:50.150> you're

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
pc and you don't have premium but you're

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.700 
pc and you don't have premium but you're
thinking<00:04:50.690> about<00:04:50.900> which<00:04:51.139> one<00:04:51.349> of<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.530> map

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
thinking about which one of the map

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800 
thinking about which one of the map
packs<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.130> you<00:04:52.250> want<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> buy<00:04:52.760> buy<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:53.389> one

packs that you want to buy buy this one

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.930 
packs that you want to buy buy this one
because<00:04:54.229> this<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.740> by<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.190> far<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.639> best

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
because this is by and far the best

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.629 
because this is by and far the best
