00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
general parts of a bacteria starting

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.299 
general parts of a bacteria starting
with<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:09.200> membrane<00:00:10.200> around<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.679> bacteria

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
bacteria is the plasma membrane the same

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
bacteria is the plasma membrane the same

as on any cell animal cell plant cell
whatever<00:00:22.140> type<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> were<00:00:22.800> looking<00:00:23.100> at

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
whatever type of so you were looking at

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
whatever type of so you were looking at
fungus<00:00:23.970> cell<00:00:24.150> doesn't<00:00:24.420> matter<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.140> first

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
fungus cell doesn't matter the first

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.740 
fungus cell doesn't matter the first
thing<00:00:25.740> around<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.670> cytoplasm<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.390> always

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
thing around the cytoplasm is always

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
thing around the cytoplasm is always
going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.500> plasma<00:00:29.070> membrane<00:00:29.599> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
going to be your plasma membrane the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.650 
going to be your plasma membrane the
next<00:00:30.900> layer<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.430> cell<00:00:32.790> wall<00:00:33.030> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
next layer out here is your cell wall so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
next layer out here is your cell wall so
as<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.380> saw<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.800> plant<00:00:35.190> cells<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.910> bacteria

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
as we saw in plant cells the bacteria

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
as we saw in plant cells the bacteria
also<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> cell<00:00:37.530> wall<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
also have a cell wall so that's the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
also have a cell wall so that's the
layer<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.420> blue<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
layer that you see here in blue in the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
layer that you see here in blue in the
middle<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> outermost<00:00:42.180> layer<00:00:42.510> here

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
middle and then the outermost layer here

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
middle and then the outermost layer here
is<00:00:43.680> called<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> glycocalyx<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.989> glycocalyx

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
is called the glycocalyx the glycocalyx

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
is called the glycocalyx the glycocalyx
is<00:00:46.980> also<00:00:47.280> sometimes<00:00:47.520> called<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.059> slime<00:00:48.420> layer

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
is also sometimes called the slime layer

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.580 
is also sometimes called the slime layer
or<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> capsule<00:00:49.739> depending<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:51.379> how<00:00:52.550> closely

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
or the capsule depending on how closely

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.819 
or the capsule depending on how closely
how<00:00:55.590> closely<00:00:56.449> put<00:00:57.449> together<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.079> molecules

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
how closely put together the molecules

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.610 
how closely put together the molecules
are<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> outer<00:00:59.940> surface<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
are on that outer surface there but it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
are on that outer surface there but it
is<00:01:01.739> regardless<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.760> whether<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> slime

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is regardless of whether it's a slime

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.570 
is regardless of whether it's a slime
layer<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> capsule<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> always<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
layer or a capsule it is always the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.870 
layer or a capsule it is always the
glycocalyx<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.880> plasma

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
glycocalyx so we have the plasma

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
glycocalyx so we have the plasma
membrane<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.450> well<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> glycocalyx<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
membrane so well and the glycocalyx that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.420 
membrane so well and the glycocalyx that
you<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:12.229> around<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.590> outside<00:01:13.979> attached

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you see here around the outside attached

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
you see here around the outside attached
to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.720> outside<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.650> they're

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to the outside here you see they're

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
to the outside here you see they're
actually<00:01:17.189> extensions<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> plasma

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
actually extensions of the plasma

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
actually extensions of the plasma
membrane<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.650> they're<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:20.040> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
membrane as you see here they're kind of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
membrane as you see here they're kind of
coming<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.450> other<00:01:21.479> layers<00:01:21.930> but

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
coming through the other layers but

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
coming through the other layers but
they're<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.530> coming<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.009> nap<00:01:23.430> flats

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
they're actually coming from nap flats

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.179 
they're actually coming from nap flats
membrane<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> those<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.540> thin<00:01:27.540> Brahe

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
membrane so those are the thin Brahe

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.660 
membrane so those are the thin Brahe
that<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.590> we've<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.159> one

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that you see here then we've got one

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
that you see here then we've got one
long<00:01:32.850> extension<00:01:33.360> coming<00:01:33.600> off<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
long extension coming off here which is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.969 
long extension coming off here which is
a<00:01:34.290> portion<00:01:34.710> flagellum<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:36.409> inside<00:01:37.409> remember

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a portion flagellum and inside remember

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
a portion flagellum and inside remember
this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> prokaryotic<00:01:39.150> cell<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.840> do

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this is a prokaryotic cell so they do

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.889 
this is a prokaryotic cell so they do
not<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.740> nucleus<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.689> is

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
not have a nucleus what they do have is

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.370 
not have a nucleus what they do have is
a<00:01:42.930> nucleoid<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> nucleoid<00:01:44.880> region<00:01:45.200> which<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
a nucleoid or a nucleoid region which is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.310 
a nucleoid or a nucleoid region which is
where<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.920> DNA<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> bacteria<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.960> found

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
where the DNA of the bacteria is found

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.520 
where the DNA of the bacteria is found
so<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.299> bacterial<00:01:51.299> chromosome<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so this is the bacterial chromosome so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710 
so this is the bacterial chromosome so
this<00:01:52.770> area<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.820> nucleoid<00:01:54.329> or

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
this area here is your nucleoid or

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.010 
this area here is your nucleoid or
nucleoid<00:01:55.320> region<00:01:56.329> also<00:01:57.329> inside<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> cell

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
nucleoid region also inside the cell

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.649 
nucleoid region also inside the cell
here<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.189> little<00:01:59.939> pink<00:02:00.180> dots<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
here are the little pink dots that you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.730 
here are the little pink dots that you
see<00:02:00.750> here<00:02:01.140> these<00:02:01.350> are<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.700> ribosomes<00:02:03.740> for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
see here these are the ribosomes for

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740 
see here these are the ribosomes for
producing<00:02:05.280> proteins<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.850> course<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> then

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
producing proteins of course and then

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
producing proteins of course and then
you<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.530> additional<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.340> rings

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you see these additional little rings

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.290 
you see these additional little rings
that<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.849> see

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that you see

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
that you see
here<00:02:09.600> those<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:09.870> the<00:02:10.140> plasmids<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.280> may<00:02:11.460> or

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
here those are the plasmids you may or

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
here those are the plasmids you may or
may<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.210> know<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.960> plasmids<00:02:13.590> but

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
may not have to know the plasmids but

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
may not have to know the plasmids but
those<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.250> additional<00:02:14.550> little<00:02:15.000> rings<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.420> DNA

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
those are additional little rings of DNA

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.730 
those are additional little rings of DNA
that<00:02:15.990> we<00:02:16.110> see<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.790> also<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:19.020> bacterial

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
that we see here also on the bacterial

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.550 
that we see here also on the bacterial
cell<00:02:20.010> wall<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> different<00:02:22.350> layers

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
cell wall you see the different layers

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.550 
cell wall you see the different layers
of<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.920> cell<00:02:23.220> wall<00:02:23.460> here<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.170> these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
of the cell wall here and this is these

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.150 
of the cell wall here and this is these
random<00:02:26.040> positive<00:02:26.730> versus<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.480> gram-negative

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
random positive versus the gram-negative

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.980 
random positive versus the gram-negative
bacteria<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:30.300> see<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
bacteria and you see here that the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.650 
bacteria and you see here that the
grande<00:02:31.230> positive<00:02:31.800> bacteria<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.300> thicker

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
grande positive bacteria have a thicker

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.020 
grande positive bacteria have a thicker
layer<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.800> blue<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.580> here

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
layer of the blue that you see here

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.570 
layer of the blue that you see here
which<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.510> peptidoglycan<00:02:37.050> layer<00:02:37.620> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
which is your peptidoglycan layer you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.430 
which is your peptidoglycan layer you
see<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.790> gram-negative<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> thinner

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
see the gram-negative has a thinner

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.550 
see the gram-negative has a thinner
layer<00:02:40.770> okay<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:41.970> remember<00:02:42.270> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
layer okay so if you just remember a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.320 
layer okay so if you just remember a
plus<00:02:43.560> sign<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> thicker<00:02:44.670> symbol<00:02:45.120> than<00:02:45.270> a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
plus sign is a thicker symbol than a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.410 
plus sign is a thicker symbol than a
minus<00:02:45.750> sign<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.430> negative

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
minus sign so this one is your negative

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.840 
minus sign so this one is your negative
because<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.140> thinner<00:02:49.470> layer<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
because it's a thinner layer the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.910 
because it's a thinner layer the
gram-negative<00:02:51.090> also<00:02:51.960> has<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.410> additional

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
gram-negative also has this additional

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.130 
gram-negative also has this additional
layer<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:54.000> don't<00:02:54.210> see<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.960> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
layer here that we don't see here and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.700 
layer here that we don't see here and
these<00:02:55.800> are<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:56.340> Lippo<00:02:57.000> polysaccharides<00:02:57.990> so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
these are your Lippo polysaccharides so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.010 
these are your Lippo polysaccharides so
the<00:02:58.860> difference<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> peptidoglycan<00:03:00.060> in

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the difference in the peptidoglycan in

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.140 
the difference in the peptidoglycan in
the<00:03:01.200> cell<00:03:01.410> wall<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.460> additional<00:03:02.940> layer

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the cell wall and the additional layer

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.990 
the cell wall and the additional layer
of<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.630> peptidoglycan<00:03:03.960> x'<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.580> we<00:03:05.790> see

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
of the peptidoglycan x' is what we see

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.420 
of the peptidoglycan x' is what we see
is<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.300> difference<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.050> gram<00:03:07.920> positive

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
is the difference in the gram positive

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.520 
is the difference in the gram positive
bacteria<00:03:08.460> versus<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> gram<00:03:09.690> negative

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
bacteria versus the gram negative

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.560 
bacteria versus the gram negative
bacteria
