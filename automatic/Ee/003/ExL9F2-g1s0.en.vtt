again today i'll be doing the second

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.369 
again today i'll be doing the second
star<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.279> cosmic<00:00:05.730> code<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:05.970> galaxies<00:00:06.480> this

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
star in the cosmic code of galaxies this

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
star in the cosmic code of galaxies this
one<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> end<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> level<00:00:09.420> just

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
one is at the end of the level just

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.879 
one is at the end of the level just
about<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.889> third<00:00:11.070> star<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.150> same<00:00:12.889> but

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
about and the third star is the same but

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.109 
about and the third star is the same but
you'll<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.519> next<00:00:15.210> video<00:00:16.880> in<00:00:17.880> this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
you'll see that in next video in this

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.660 
you'll see that in next video in this
level<00:00:18.359> will<00:00:19.109> be<00:00:19.140> introduced<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.859> plenty<00:00:20.430> of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
level will be introduced to plenty of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.660 
level will be introduced to plenty of
swimming<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:22.140> skating<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:23.039> least<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
swimming and a skating at least in this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.800 
swimming and a skating at least in this
first<00:00:23.730> part<00:00:27.289> if<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> didn't<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.810> water

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
first part if you didn't know the water

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.709 
first part if you didn't know the water
is<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.230> ice<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.090> star<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
is now ice because in the first star of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.830 
is now ice because in the first star of
the<00:00:33.870> yellow<00:00:34.079> star<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> switch<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.540> turn

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the yellow star you use a switch to turn

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.440 
the yellow star you use a switch to turn
fine<00:00:37.469> into<00:00:37.890> ice<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.640> we're<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fine into ice so now that we're in the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
fine into ice so now that we're in the
caves<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.290> i<00:00:43.410> call<00:00:43.649> them

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
caves as i call them

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
caves as i call them
we<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.770> navigate<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.250> through<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
we need to navigate our way through so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.490 
we need to navigate our way through so
that<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.840> into<00:00:48.989> outer<00:00:49.170> space

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that we can get into outer space

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.270 
that we can get into outer space
i<00:00:54.170> mean<00:00:55.170> technically<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.070> outer<00:00:56.160> space

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
i mean technically we are in outer space

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
i mean technically we are in outer space
but<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.239> i<00:00:57.329> mean

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.090 

all<00:01:02.020> right<00:01:02.520> forget<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.670> box<00:01:07.770> some<00:01:08.770> reason<00:01:09.070> I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
all right forget the box some reason I

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.920 
all right forget the box some reason I
can't<00:01:09.310> long<00:01:09.520> jump<00:01:09.850> there<00:01:10.120> I<00:01:10.150> just<00:01:10.480> didn't<00:01:10.810> get

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
can't long jump there I just didn't get

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:29.570 
can't long jump there I just didn't get
in<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.140> red<00:01:11.320> speed

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.249 

hit<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> switch<00:01:30.540> till<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.410> get<00:01:31.650> through

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.499 

the<00:01:38.799> Gov<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.159> eels<00:01:39.369> those<00:01:39.850> things<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.390> are

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
the Gov the eels those things that are

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
the Gov the eels those things that are
annoying<00:01:40.869> as<00:01:40.990> hell

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.289 

and<00:01:54.549> here<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.820> go<00:01:54.969> into<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.840> pipe

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:10.650 

we're<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.390> coming<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> second<00:02:01.560> star

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.260 

I<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.530> lose<00:02:11.680> my<00:02:11.920> direction<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.820> little<00:02:13.060> bit

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
I kind of lose my direction a little bit

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.940 
I kind of lose my direction a little bit
at<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.690> point<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.650> star<00:02:17.920> is

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
at this point I think that the star is

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.130 
at this point I think that the star is
right<00:02:18.760> there<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.790> actually<00:02:22.570> isn't<00:02:22.930> it's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
right there but it's actually isn't it's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:34.080 
right there but it's actually isn't it's
a<00:02:23.290> little<00:02:23.560> bit<00:02:23.650> further<00:02:23.950> up

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.170 

and<00:02:34.180> there<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.110> there<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.090> be

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
and there it is right there just to be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.630 
and there it is right there just to be
safe<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.480> want<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.930> swim<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.530> go<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.370> off

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
safe you want to swim up and go on off

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.770 
safe you want to swim up and go on off
to<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.240> say<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.020> fall<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:42.780> grab

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
to the right say you just fall and grab

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.340 
to the right say you just fall and grab
store<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.980> there<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.160> go
