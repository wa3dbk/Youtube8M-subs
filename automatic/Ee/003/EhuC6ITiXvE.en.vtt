00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hi, I'm Alejandra, they do not talk and you're in 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.949
 my house that is your house we are going to 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.730
 work some legs the implant that 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:16.039
 call here are you bought them in a nursery 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.800
 remember friends that these legs of 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.910
 elephant are delicate and are in 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.550
 danger of extinction 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 whenever they buy a landline and they are 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.269
 of nursery that have permission that are left 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.519
 for forest use because you can even 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.440
 this when buying an elephant foot by 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.080
 that's better than shopping well live 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.960
 the acquaintances in commercial places that 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.000
 have the permission of similarity and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.310
 let's make a very fatherly arrangement to 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.280
 who is this rectangular coconut flower pot 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.760
 to put in a little corner so very 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.130
 very very zen ok ok let's start with 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.850
 Coconut fiber coconut flower pot 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.970
 remember that it is degradable horde of 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.440
 cyclable meat and that's why we love 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.149
 here 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.149
 ok let's use 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.570
 it's called expanded clay the chair 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.359
 expanded are 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.399
 pellets or grains of 'the clay the 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.920
 chair that are cooked at a few temperatures 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.200
 very high so that it helps you to the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 stability at this time we're going to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.429
 use to drain because to drain 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.009
 because the elephant plant is not very 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.170
 friend of the excess water then to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.959
 do not clump together so there is not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.850
 with too much water will blow a 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:41.500
 little bit of expanded clay 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.610
 that we already put a my bed 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.030
 and expanded and now we're going to put a 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.540
 land 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.480
 rich in substrates are efficient dust 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 of coconut more 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.050
 in natural ground always notice that your 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.850
 plant then you think how are you going 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.390
 accommodate you have a sad image 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.550
 mental and the words and so on and then 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.150
 that you prepare both on earth and in 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.150
 the stones 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.220
 ok we loose the pot remember that the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 loose squeezing 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.440
 when we loosen up look these pots are of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.830
 whereby the plastic 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.260
 in raids you have to work a little 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.980
 the root if you leave it like this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.829
 quite work adapt remember what 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.130
 that we have talked about in the roots the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:48.430
 very important knowledge base 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.530
 with them it is a very resistant plant 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.440
 do not attack and you broke tantita 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.170
 as long as the root remains stuck 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.910
 to the onion 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.050
 ok let's put here what I 'm 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.050
 looking is to form 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.260
 and a figure as if it were one 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.480
 Kate 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.920
 I'm going to take out the other one once for 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.920
 show you what we are looking for 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.780
 we are looking for a figure more or less 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.070
 so be like the three legs very 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.160
 stuck and now let's fill in with 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.160
 land 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:37.760
 the excess of land and to fill the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:43.350
 hollows always remember after 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.600
 plant a plant you have to water it 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.770
 have to give him food and the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:55.910
 good soil a little fertilizer and 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.910
 Now we are going to decorate it with 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.540
 delicious rinds little forgiveness 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.400
 wood we have here the bark of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.180
 wood what he's going to do is that he's going to 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.390
 help maintain humidity 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.390
 keep them from growing yellow 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.769
 clover and all those things also you 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.139
 you can put the white stones that 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:28.080
 would generate a very father contrast is a 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.560
 Very nice plant that you can put with 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.270
 You do not need much sun if you put on sun 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.150
 you need a lot more water if you put it 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.880
 in the shade no problem grows 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.970
 perfect and it is doing a very 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
 very interesting with the years go 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.900
 Acquiring very parent figures 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.090
 so what I recommend is that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.820
 you have them together so that over the years 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.509
 they are sticking they go running and 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.190
 they are generating a plant very father very 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:04.380
 very beautiful here that the fabric presents 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.710
 Now let's see a little 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.570
 if they remember that the copy is doubled and 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.570
 this is my house that is your house
