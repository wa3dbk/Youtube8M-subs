00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.649
 I use this oil enough to apply 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.039
 quite a bit on the palm 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.579
 rub and then hold over the tips 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.280
 hair at temperatures below + 25 degrees 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.350
 coconut oil hardens but don't get scared 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 its properties but it does not lose 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.550
 this way you instantly is an indicator 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 good quality butter 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 if she doesn't harden, then you bought 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.030
 fake coconut oil can 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 use not only by itself but also 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.290

 so at home we find coconut oil honey and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 eggs 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 the number of ingredients depends on the length 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.840
 and thick hair 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.659
 I like 2 tablespoons enough 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.850
 coconut oil pre it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.030
 need to melt 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 because water but in this form we 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.679
 most often happens but for the mask here I am 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.289
 melted microwave literally 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.179

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.329
 vitamins keratin is very good 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 smoothes hair eliminates dandruff 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.939
 charges them with energy and helps fight 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
 with scientists it ends now even less 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.990
 have to cut hair 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.739
 which of course pleases eggs are rich 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.650
 vitamins of group b and a phosphorus zinc 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.299
 and copper these elements are necessary for our 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.940
 body in general and hair in 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.860
 separately they nourish the hair make them 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.910
 healthy and improves growth 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.910
 I use 2 eggs for my length 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.769
 mix all ingredients first 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.030
 you can even beat a little egg so 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:36.890
 It will be easier 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.890
 add butter now honey 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 very nourishing mask she is very good 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 improves hair growth and hair becomes 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.580
 as if glowing from the inside is all 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 stir thoroughly until smooth 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.150
 consistency 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.390
 here you can even a little bit 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:06.180
 such a beater on and movements to do 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:08.310
 everything turned out the mask is ready I put 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.020
 first this mask on the roots then 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.600
 distribute over the entire hair length 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.630
 paying special attention to the tips 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.430
 one hour to wash off the mask you need to cool 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.860
 water is by no means hot otherwise 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.590
 eggs will just boil hair for 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.480
 enhance the effect put on your head 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 plastic bag or shower cap 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.709
 and also a terry towel from the first 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.080
 times it may not like Moscow 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.300
 because coconut honey oil will 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.519
 to leak you it will annoy 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.950
 therefore I recommend to throw the second 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.930
 towel on the shoulders and so will you 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.579
 much more comfortable this mask 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.910
 promotes hair growth 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.160
 nourishes them makes healthy and shiny 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.410
 but coconut oil is useful not only for 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.510
 hair she is perfect for tanning 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.579
 fortunately those times have already passed 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.430
 girls did not use the funds 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.019
 protect skin from ultraviolet rays 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.510
 remembering myself five years ago I didnâ€™t 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.090
 saw sense in them instead 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.090
 beautiful even tan red skin 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.700

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.440
 many will find out now I am actively 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.350

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.640

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.080
 firstly it moisturizes the skin no 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.450
 feelings of tightness after sun 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.760
 procedures and secondly tanning with it 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.650
 much faster that's why the company 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.530
 green planet chose it as 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.320
 main component according to tan oil 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.020
 Caribbean formula natural smell 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.440

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.569

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.059
 what else does a girl need for happiness on 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.429
 rest really use this oil 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:49.379
 recommended already on prepared skin 

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:51.119
 since having only three of them 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.659
 so in the first days of stay on 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.429
 the sun 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.860
 use funds in higher 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.809
 protection factor usually recommend 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.059
 start spf25 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.909
 gradually decreases the figure if the skin 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:06.629
 dark can then spf15 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:09.149
 Now a few words about this oil it 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.520

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:13.679
 distributed but before use 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.719
 be sure to shake and not yet 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:18.830
 forget to put it every time after 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.930
 bathing because it is not waterproof 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.279
