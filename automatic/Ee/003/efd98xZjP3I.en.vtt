 insert macabre music a certain idle 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:15.780
 happening at your pizzeria does not seem to 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:18.870
 A3 series, my God, the stage has changed. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 I'm sorry but I'll take you to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.319
 questioning 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 blood and was unable to show 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.280
 for you 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 we come to an interrogation ask the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.830
 they and they got along well with Fred then 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.099
 Come on, I got on well with him, it was mine. 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.099
 best friend 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:47.390
 he was faithful, he was partying a visit 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:47.390
 I dated himself to him as they 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:02.989
 respond well 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:07.650
 lived very well with him and he killed fred 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 chica chica fox but I think it was fox 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.500
 Because it has nothing to do with the cup. 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.540
 I think it was fox the black skin li 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.709
 here let me see 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.260
 ask him if he misses the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.180
 fred 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:26.100
 Yes, I think it's a bit suspicious. 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.239
 but I think it's the focus 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.620
 Focus here straight, I 'm right. 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.260
 What I'm talking about 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.769
 and you let the focus pass and it was not 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.620
 he who offered mathew opposite sim fox and 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.489
 bratty stop there 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.670
 know the reason is that the fox killed he sees 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.720
 Police time ready made the noise 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.799
 the police or you will not 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.139
 able to listen 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.880
 so come on, okay, I'll tell you a tile 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.500
 because I was tired of always staying 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.380
 behind those curtains 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.000
 ah I did not want to be different, I wanted 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.520
 to be on stage all the animals 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.010
 unix I wanted to be the main wanted 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.140
 being a leader there wanted to be a leader of 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.230
 all but now fred is dead now 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:16.920
 it will not be the easiest fred now will 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.030
 being fox makes bill that was now all one 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.090
 gotcha 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.390
 We used fake blood to make blood. 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.000
 you should know that animatronics 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:33.690
 never dies if we die alone and live 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.220
 of what we are robots is the police tchan 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.020

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.470

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.450
 What happened to the cartoon cops? 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.260
 curious to see the cops killed 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.260
 was killed 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.900
 It's kind of obvious that they were killed 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.940
 because the critters killed them so they 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.960
 were really dead 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.470

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.090

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.740

 put the portal there for the guys to die for 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.750
