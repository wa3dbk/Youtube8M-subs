00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.690 

so<00:00:20.450> we<00:00:20.690> worked<00:00:20.930> two<00:00:21.260> single<00:00:21.590> crochets<00:00:22.040> in<00:00:22.400> each

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
so we worked two single crochets in each

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.510 
so we worked two single crochets in each
stitch<00:00:22.760> around<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:24.080> was<00:00:24.230> 12<00:00:24.710> stitches

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
stitch around and that was 12 stitches

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.510 
stitch around and that was 12 stitches
total<00:00:26.740> so<00:00:27.740> now<00:00:27.860> we're<00:00:27.980> going<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.160> do<00:00:28.279> two

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
total so now we're going to do two

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.019 
total so now we're going to do two
single<00:00:28.850> crochet<00:00:29.360> in<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.600> next<00:00:29.630> stitch<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:31.700> I

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
single crochet in the next stitch and I

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.700 
single crochet in the next stitch and I
think<00:00:32.239> it's<00:00:32.360> easier<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:32.900> go<00:00:33.050> ahead<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.650> do

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
think it's easier to go ahead and do

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.890 
think it's easier to go ahead and do
like<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.860> first<00:00:37.220> part<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.510> where<00:00:38.690> there's<00:00:38.840> a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
like the first part and where there's a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.049 
like the first part and where there's a
comma<00:00:39.230> just<00:00:39.620> start<00:00:39.950> with<00:00:40.129> that<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.700> then<00:00:40.820> go

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
comma just start with that and then go

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.280 
comma just start with that and then go
on<00:00:41.239> to<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.450> next<00:00:41.540> thing<00:00:41.690> instead<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:42.050> trying

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
on to the next thing instead of trying

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.830 
on to the next thing instead of trying
to<00:00:42.320> read<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.650> whole<00:00:42.890> line<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:43.670> trying<00:00:44.600> to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
to read the whole line and trying to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.479 
to read the whole line and trying to
remember<00:00:45.140> all<00:00:45.320> of<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.070> we're<00:00:46.220> just<00:00:46.250> gonna

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
remember all of that so we're just gonna

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.549 
remember all of that so we're just gonna
do<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:49.040> next<00:00:49.460> step<00:00:50.330> here<00:00:50.600> which<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.199> single

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
on and you see this is going to be round

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.740 
on and you see this is going to be round
four<00:02:35.549> where<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.360> single

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
four where we're going to have to single

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
four where we're going to have to single
crochet<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> next<00:02:37.440> stitch<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.160> then

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
crochet in the next stitch and then

single<00:02:38.970> crochet<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:39.959> each<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.379> next<00:02:40.680> two

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
single crochet in each of the next two

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.630 
single crochet in each of the next two
so<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.230> looks<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.829> they're

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.760 

repeat<00:03:43.580> from<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.300> star<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.660> here's<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.470> star

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
repeat from the star so here's the star

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
rose or rounds 5 through 7 we're going

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.790

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
to single crochet in each stitch around

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.219 
to single crochet in each stitch around
so<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:46.120> fairly<00:04:46.419> simple<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.930> just<00:04:46.990> have

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
so this is fairly simple you just have

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.170 
so this is fairly simple you just have
to<00:04:47.349> keep<00:04:47.560> counting<00:04:48.099> it's<00:04:48.789> going<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.030> be<00:04:49.150> a

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
to keep counting it's going to be a

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
in each of the first six stitches so

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.029 
in each of the first six stitches so
let's<00:05:47.129> do<00:05:47.370> that<00:05:47.689> two<00:05:48.689> single<00:05:49.080> crochet<00:05:49.529> in<00:05:49.770> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
first six stitches so here we go we're

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.070 
first six stitches so here we go we're
back<00:05:53.819> to<00:05:54.000> our<00:05:54.029> first<00:05:54.270> stitch<00:05:54.569> we're<00:05:54.900> going<00:05:54.930> to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
back to our first stitch we're going to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.589
