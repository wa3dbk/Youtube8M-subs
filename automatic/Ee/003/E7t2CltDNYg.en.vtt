00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
so continuing in our discussions of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.299 
so continuing in our discussions of
rhythm<00:00:06.230> another<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.799> know<00:00:07.859> pattern<00:00:08.220> that's

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
rhythm another you know pattern that's

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.950 
rhythm another you know pattern that's
fun<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.580> play<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> I'd<00:00:09.120> love<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
fun to play with and I'd love to get a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.110 
fun to play with and I'd love to get a
dozen<00:00:10.440> people<00:00:10.740> doing<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.219> perfect<00:00:11.700> sync

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
dozen people doing this in perfect sync

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.919 
dozen people doing this in perfect sync
is<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.620> call<00:00:13.740> chase<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.219> Sun<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
is what we can call chase the Sun and

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.269 
is what we can call chase the Sun and
again<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> pattern<00:00:16.740> work<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
again this is a pattern work if you

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.540 
again this is a pattern work if you
count<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> downbeats<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> goes<00:00:18.859> one<00:00:19.859> two

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
count the downbeats it goes one two

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
count the downbeats it goes one two
three<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.900> two<00:00:22.529> three<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:24.359> three<00:00:24.750> one

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
three one two three one two three one

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.490 
three one two three one two three one
two<00:00:25.740> three<00:00:26.609> which<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.599> great<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.109> that's<00:00:28.230> fine

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
two three which is great and that's fine

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
two three which is great and that's fine
and<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.949> might<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> count<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and that might be a good way to count it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870 
and that might be a good way to count it
however<00:00:31.140> again<00:00:31.320> we're<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> playing<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
however again we're gonna be playing for

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.990 
however again we're gonna be playing for
for<00:00:33.180> music<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.829> it'll<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.190> it'll<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> nice

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to be able to put it on the for for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.799 
to be able to put it on the for for
consistently<00:00:38.910> although<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.600> will

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
consistently although you we will

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
consistently although you we will
ultimately<00:00:39.989> learn<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> play<00:00:41.070> threes<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
ultimately learn how to play threes you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
ultimately learn how to play threes you
know<00:00:41.940> three<00:00:42.450> four<00:00:42.480> rhythms<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.050> four<00:00:43.290> core

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
know three four rhythms on four core

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
know three four rhythms on four core
music<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:46.710> again<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.309> we're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
music but then what we do again is we're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.510 
music but then what we do again is we're
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> count<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.739> downbeat<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.160> hands

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
going to count the downbeat as two hands

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.139 
going to count the downbeat as two hands
are<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.809> shoulders<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.460> the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
behind your hips behind your shoulders
hips<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:31.259> all<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.740> getting<00:01:31.890> used<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
hips it's all about just getting used to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
hips it's all about just getting used to
counting<00:01:32.930> both<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> poi<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.590> pointing

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
counting both when the poi are pointing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.249 
counting both when the poi are pointing
down<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> player<00:01:36.270> pointing<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
down and when the player pointing up I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
down and when the player pointing up I
hope<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.130> makes<00:01:38.250> sense<00:01:38.310> well<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.140> few

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
hope that makes sense well know in a few

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.249 
hope that makes sense well know in a few
weeks<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> makes<00:01:41.070> sense

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
weeks if that makes sense

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.389 
weeks if that makes sense
so<00:01:43.259> again<00:01:43.439> I'll<00:01:43.530> put<00:01:43.619> music<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so again I'll put music on and you can

00:01:44.399 --> 00:02:44.170 
so again I'll put music on and you can
just<00:01:44.430> try<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> follow<00:01:44.970> on

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.789 

again<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.209> hope<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.659> makes<00:02:45.810> sense<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.319> you

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
again I hope that makes sense if you

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.350 
again I hope that makes sense if you
can't<00:02:47.129> do<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.459> you're<00:02:47.819> still<00:02:48.000> you're<00:02:48.120> not<00:02:48.239> in

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
can't do this you're still you're not in

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 
can't do this you're still you're not in
trouble<00:02:48.680> don't<00:02:49.680> worry<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.159> your<00:02:50.250> best

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
trouble don't worry just do your best

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.880 
trouble don't worry just do your best
and<00:02:50.689> this<00:02:51.689> is<00:02:51.750> an<00:02:51.930> experiment<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.500> try<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.709> get

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
and this is an experiment to try to get

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
and this is an experiment to try to get
people<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.540> prerequisites<00:02:54.540> through<00:02:54.989> videos

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
people to prerequisites through videos

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.399 
people to prerequisites through videos
so<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.299> point<00:02:57.510> love<00:02:57.720> camp<00:02:58.049> not

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
so it's a it's a point love camp not

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:09.900 
so it's a it's a point love camp not
ploidy<00:02:58.950> stressed-out<00:02:59.280> camp

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.970 

you
