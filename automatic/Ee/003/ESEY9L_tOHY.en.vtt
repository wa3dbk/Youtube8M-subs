00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.070 
just started using this so I can't
really<00:04:04.400> say<00:04:04.730> how<00:04:05.060> effective<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:05.900> what

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
really say how effective it is but what

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.229 
really say how effective it is but what
I've<00:04:06.200> seen<00:04:06.380> so<00:04:06.440> far<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:07.069> like<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.580> I'm<00:04:07.760> not

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
I've seen so far I like it I'm not

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.120 
I've seen so far I like it I'm not
breaking<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.290> that's<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.709> good<00:04:09.739> sign

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
breaking out so that's a good sign

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.250 
breaking out so that's a good sign
they're<00:04:10.819> both<00:04:10.970> pretty<00:04:11.239> light<00:04:11.569> creams<00:04:11.989> I

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
they're both pretty light creams I

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.050 
they're both pretty light creams I
really<00:04:12.890> like<00:04:13.069> both<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.280> them<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.760> i<00:04:13.910> would

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
really like both of them and i would

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.330 
really like both of them and i would
definitely<00:04:14.510> repurchase<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.319> equate<00:04:15.620> it's

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
definitely repurchase the equate it's

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.520 
definitely repurchase the equate it's
one<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.760> best<00:04:17.030> out<00:04:17.329> there<00:04:17.359> for<00:04:17.959> me<00:04:18.109> for<00:04:18.380> my

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
one of the best out there for me for my
skin<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:20.180> think<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:21.079> know<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:22.310> four

skin and I think that you know for four

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.180 
skin and I think that you know for four
dollars<00:04:22.700> it's<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:24.410> fantastic<00:04:25.070> it's
