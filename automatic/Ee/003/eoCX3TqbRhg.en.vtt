I<00:01:44.640> guess<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> would<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.509> worth<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
I guess it would be worth it you get the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.210

it<00:01:47.700> works<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.079> sometimes<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.890> upload

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it works well but sometimes the upload

times<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.390> videos<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.619> bit

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
times for the videos can be a bit

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.819 
times for the videos can be a bit
tedious<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.840> south<00:01:55.140> spot<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
tedious and if you are south spot like I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.789 
tedious and if you are south spot like I
do<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.780> it's<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.320> even<00:01:58.469> worth

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
do then it's like it's not even worth

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920 
do then it's like it's not even worth
