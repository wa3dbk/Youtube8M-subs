around it show you everything about it
what<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.630> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.079> when<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> want<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
what you want to do when you want to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
what you want to do when you want to
turn<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> front<00:00:38.790> tine<00:00:39.090> tiller<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
turn it into a front tine tiller is you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190 
turn it into a front tine tiller is you
take<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:41.070> cover<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.780> swing<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
take that back cover off you swing the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.029 
take that back cover off you swing the
handle<00:00:43.559> around<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.270> then<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> start<00:00:45.660> killing

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
handle around and then you start killing

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.029 
handle around and then you start killing
from<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> front<00:00:47.489> instead<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> we'll

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
from the front instead and we'll

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:28.820 
from the front instead and we'll
demonstrate<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> moment

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.060 

and<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.730> it<00:01:30.290> now<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.740> their

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and there you have it now it's their

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.950 
and there you have it now it's their
front<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.430> time<00:01:32.640> killer

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:03:47.550 

let's<00:01:36.500> turn<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.890> up

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.170 

all<00:03:48.560> right<00:03:48.770> I<00:03:48.800> also<00:03:49.070> want<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.460> point<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.850> that

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
all right I also want to point out that

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.030 
all right I also want to point out that
in<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.930> rear<00:03:51.110> tine<00:03:51.380> mode<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:53.090> tires<00:03:53.750> do<00:03:54.710> turn

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
in the rear tine mode the tires do turn

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.700 
in the rear tine mode the tires do turn
forward<00:03:55.430> while<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> tines<00:03:56.810> turn<00:03:57.140> backwards

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
forward while the tines turn backwards

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.660 
forward while the tines turn backwards
so<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> self-propelled<00:04:00.290> unit<00:04:00.860> but

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
so that it is a self-propelled unit but

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.040 
so that it is a self-propelled unit but
when<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> engine<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.300> stopped<00:04:02.540> like<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.930> is

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
when the engine is stopped like it is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.950 
when the engine is stopped like it is
now<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.620> cannot<00:04:04.460> roll<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.940> because<00:04:05.780> that

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
now you cannot roll it because that

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.680 
now you cannot roll it because that
transmission<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.710> locked<00:04:06.980> how<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.000> move<00:04:08.420> this

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
transmission is locked how you move this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.100 
transmission is locked how you move this
is<00:04:09.580> you<00:04:10.580> turn<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.910> handle<00:04:11.000> around<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:11.690> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
is you turn the handle around and the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:51.040 
is you turn the handle around and the
wheels<00:04:12.320> get<00:04:12.500> freed<00:04:12.740> up<00:04:12.920> like<00:04:13.670> so

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.680 

and<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.200> wheels<00:04:52.380> are<00:04:52.530> freed<00:04:53.540> there<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.630> is

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
and the wheels are freed there it is

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.170 
and the wheels are freed there it is
