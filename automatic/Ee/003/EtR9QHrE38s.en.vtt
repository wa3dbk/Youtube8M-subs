brickmaster<00:00:13.019> review<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.429> lego<00:00:14.700> creator<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
brickmaster review the lego creator and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.189 
brickmaster review the lego creator and
true<00:00:16.470> personality<00:00:17.460> alligator<00:00:18.170> or<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
true personality alligator or a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.460 
true personality alligator or a
crocodile<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:20.130> does<00:00:20.279> not<00:00:20.430> say<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.970> think<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
crocodile it does not say I think it's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.550 
crocodile it does not say I think it's
an<00:00:22.560> alligator<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.970> best<00:00:24.300> guess<00:00:24.560> but

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
an alligator that's my best guess but

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
an alligator that's my best guess but
that's<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> animation<00:00:26.580> whole<00:00:26.820> thing<00:00:27.090> right

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that's the animation whole thing right

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.070 
that's the animation whole thing right
there<00:00:28.099> only<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.609> 15<00:00:30.359> pages<00:00:30.570> long<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
there only about 15 pages long like that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.580 
there only about 15 pages long like that
you<00:00:32.600> really<00:00:33.600> long<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.079> longer<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you really long it's longer than I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
you really long it's longer than I
thought<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.760> hand<00:00:36.030> mine's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
thought like this is my hand mine's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
thought like this is my hand mine's
pretty<00:00:36.660> big<00:00:37.790> still<00:00:38.790> longer<00:00:39.149> than<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.950> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
pretty big still longer than that this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.229 
pretty big still longer than that this
one's<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.370> nice<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.940> very<00:00:44.940> easy

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
one's really nice I like it a very easy

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.410 
one's really nice I like it a very easy
to<00:00:45.510> build<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.050> 30<00:00:46.230> seconds<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> features

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to build up like 30 seconds but features

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.319 
to build up like 30 seconds but features
are<00:00:48.600> its<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> moving<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.920> tail<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
are its got a moving the tail and the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
are its got a moving the tail and the
back<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.230> move<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.469> still<00:00:52.710> moves<00:00:52.980> sounds<00:00:53.579> like

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
back to move it still moves sounds like

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.689 
back to move it still moves sounds like
a<00:00:53.730> scorpion<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.070> that's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
a scorpion but it's like that but that's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.510 
a scorpion but it's like that but that's
not<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> point<00:00:57.410> legs<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.530> move<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.160> once

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
not the point legs don't move the once

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.689 
not the point legs don't move the once
you<00:00:59.699> well<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.390> sort<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.430> but<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you well they sort of do like this but I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
you well they sort of do like this but I
guess<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.420> move<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.559> not

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
guess they do move but on it's not

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
guess they do move but on it's not
exactly<00:01:05.070> easy<00:01:06.380> uh<00:01:07.380> these<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.280> its<00:01:08.490> eyes<00:01:08.700> by

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
exactly easy uh these are its eyes by

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.870 
exactly easy uh these are its eyes by
the<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.090> these<00:01:09.360> black<00:01:09.689> things<00:01:10.580> then<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.790> you
