00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
I noticed about this is the fact that it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.280 
I noticed about this is the fact that it
is<00:04:10.180> incredibly<00:04:11.180> fast<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:11.810> focusing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
is incredibly fast at focusing

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.809 
is incredibly fast at focusing
especially<00:04:12.590> for<00:04:13.010> doing<00:04:13.190> your<00:04:13.220> post<00:04:13.550> sports

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
and stuff that's outside need to be

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.740 
and stuff that's outside need to be
reactive<00:04:16.340> be<00:04:16.549> really<00:04:16.790> fast<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.389> that's

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
reactive be really fast and that's

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.360 
reactive be really fast and that's
really<00:04:18.049> really<00:04:18.200> helps<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:19.040> other<00:04:19.070> thing

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
