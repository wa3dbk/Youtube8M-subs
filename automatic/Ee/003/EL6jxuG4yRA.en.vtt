00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.819 
tree red matrix chard basically or admit
the<00:00:20.849> matrix<00:00:21.150> chard<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.599> used<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.110> make<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
the matrix chard are used to make the

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.679 
the matrix chard are used to make the
matrix<00:00:23.160> cube<00:00:23.610> which<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.360> you<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.660> a

going to show you how to get the red

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.740 
going to show you how to get the red
ones<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.610> easiest<00:00:33.030> red<00:00:33.390> matrix

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
ones so one of the easiest red matrix

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.770 
ones so one of the easiest red matrix
charge<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.680> Korriban<00:00:35.780> it's

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
is this Dalek one and inside there will

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.700 
is this Dalek one and inside there will
be<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.879> red<00:00:48.089> matrix<00:00:48.390> chard<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:49.379> will<00:00:49.499> be<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
be your red matrix chard there will be a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.189 
be your red matrix chard there will be a
champion<00:00:50.010> mob<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.179> 5000<00:00:51.690> HP<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.109> will

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
champion mob with like 5000 HP that will

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.259 
champion mob with like 5000 HP that will
protect<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.679> so<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.609> alone

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
alright so further yada for this red

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
alright so further yada for this red
matrix<00:01:25.890> shard<00:01:26.720> it's<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> easy<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.230> find

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
matrix shard it's kind of easy to find

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
matrix shard it's kind of easy to find
after<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> bought<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.760> hid<00:01:29.940> retainer<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
after you bought the hid retainer so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.920 
after you bought the hid retainer so
basically<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.630> let's<00:01:33.630> say<00:01:33.780> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
basically you go from let's say your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
basically you go from let's say your
base<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.650> Imperial<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.370> then<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.760> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
base for Imperial and then you go to the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.860 
base for Imperial and then you go to the
let<00:01:36.630> outpost<00:01:37.440> Peter<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.370> from<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.150> area<00:01:39.510> you

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
let outpost Peter and from this area you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.800 
let outpost Peter and from this area you
just<00:01:40.110> pull<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> ropes<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:42.480> at<00:01:42.600> some

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
just pull the ropes out and at some

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
just pull the ropes out and at some
point<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.260> just<00:01:43.290> hold<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:43.980> right<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.400> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
point you just hold your right and you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
point you just hold your right and you
will<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.910> data<00:01:45.120> Kron<00:01:45.450> inside<00:01:46.230> on<00:01:46.380> some

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
will see the data Kron inside on some

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.290 
will see the data Kron inside on some
heists<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.490> hitter<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.000> tuna<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
heists so you use your hitter of tuna on

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.210 
heists so you use your hitter of tuna on
the<00:01:48.360> ice<00:01:48.570> block<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:49.680> melt<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the ice block and it's going to melt the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.180 
the ice block and it's going to melt the
ice<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.660> on<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.770> loot<00:01:53.070> your

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
ice so on and then you can loot your

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.050 
ice so on and then you can loot your
matrix<00:01:53.520> shard

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
matrix shard

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.060 
matrix shard
so<00:01:54.900> yep<00:01:55.410> let's<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:57.830> come<00:01:58.830> on

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so yep let's do this come on

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.220 
so yep let's do this come on
melt<00:01:59.370> melt<00:02:00.210> already<00:02:00.750> melt<00:02:02.120> it's<00:02:03.120> melted<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
melt melt already melt it's melted so

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.300 
melt melt already melt it's melted so
then<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.440> can<00:02:04.560> move<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.830> matrix<00:02:05.130> out

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
then you can move your matrix out

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.149 
then you can move your matrix out
alright<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.510> for<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> last<00:02:07.020> red<00:02:07.320> matrix<00:02:07.740> shard

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
alright so for the last red matrix shard

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.759 
alright so for the last red matrix shard
you<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.879> go<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> plant<00:02:09.360> hilum<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.840> um

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
you have to go on the plant hilum and um

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.820 
you have to go on the plant hilum and um
the<00:02:11.310> pvp<00:02:11.760> plant<00:02:11.970> basically<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.629> i'm<00:02:13.530> you're

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the pvp plant basically and i'm you're

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
the pvp plant basically and i'm you're
gonna<00:02:14.069> go<00:02:14.310> from<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> base<00:02:14.790> those<00:02:15.690> down<00:02:15.989> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
gonna go from the base those down the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.260 
gonna go from the base those down the
slope<00:02:16.409> road<00:02:16.739> up<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
slope road up here and then I go to the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.720 
slope road up here and then I go to the
Republic<00:02:19.230> base<00:02:19.440> which<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.550> there

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
Republic base which is just down there

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.820 
Republic base which is just down there
pretty<00:02:20.970> much<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.990> dodge<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.319> Republic

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
pretty much so you dodge the Republic

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.540 
pretty much so you dodge the Republic
defense

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
defense

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.070 
defense
because<00:02:24.120> they're<00:02:24.300> gonna<00:02:24.390> wreck<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.870> since

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
because they're gonna wreck you since

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.530 
because they're gonna wreck you since
they're<00:02:25.260> champions<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> head<00:02:27.300> over<00:02:27.330> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
they're champions and you head over to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.490 
they're champions and you head over to
this<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.960> camp<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.720> data<00:02:30.930> crown<00:02:31.200> slash

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this little camp on the data crown slash

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.420 
this little camp on the data crown slash
red<00:02:32.010> matrix<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.480> tent<00:02:33.690> I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
red matrix I will be in a little tent I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.350 
red matrix I will be in a little tent I
think<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.700> one

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
think it's this one

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
think it's this one
yep<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.860> go<00:02:38.010> inside<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
yep it's this one so you go inside you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.690 
yep it's this one so you go inside you
kill<00:02:39.030> whatever<00:02:39.210> mob<00:02:40.050> inside<00:02:43.400> all<00:02:44.400> right<00:02:44.430> and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
kill whatever mob inside all right and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.550 
kill whatever mob inside all right and
then<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.210> have<00:02:45.330> your<00:02:45.480> data<00:02:45.690> cron<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.320> lose

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then you have your data cron so you lose

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.260 
then you have your data cron so you lose
it<00:02:46.710> then<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.490> red<00:02:47.700> matrix<00:02:48.060> shard

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
it then you have your red matrix shard

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.500 
it then you have your red matrix shard
and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.440> make<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:51.030> little<00:02:51.300> tube

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
and then you can make this little tube

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
and then you can make this little tube
if<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.140> need<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.440> red<00:02:52.560> ones<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.490> there<00:02:53.700> will

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
if you need the red ones so there will

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.030 
if you need the red ones so there will
be<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.940> video<00:02:54.180> about<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.410> location<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
be a video about the location of the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.250 
be a video about the location of the
blue<00:02:56.250> ones<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:57.180> green<00:02:57.480> ones<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.020> yellow

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
blue ones the green ones and the yellow

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.800 
blue ones the green ones and the yellow
ones<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.800> red<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.130> matrix<00:02:59.550> shards<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.330> if

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
ones the red of the matrix shards and if

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.050 
ones the red of the matrix shards and if
you<00:03:00.930> need<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.320> where<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.800> go<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> how

you need to know where to go for the how

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.300 
you need to know where to go for the how
to<00:03:03.120> assemble<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.230> matrix<00:03:04.410> cube<00:03:04.860> we

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
to assemble it into the matrix cube we

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.070 
to assemble it into the matrix cube we
already<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> video<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.570> show<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.810> how
