00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
can upgrade both of them because they

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.849 
can upgrade both of them because they
both<00:03:14.370> need<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.090> upgraded<00:03:15.620> don't<00:03:16.620> waste

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
both need to be upgraded don't waste

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.360 
both need to be upgraded don't waste
your<00:03:17.069> money

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
your money

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.009 
your money
you<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.639> if<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:17.879> around<00:03:18.060> 12<00:03:18.389> there's<00:03:18.870> no

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
you know if it's around 12 there's no

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.599 
you know if it's around 12 there's no
need<00:03:19.199> to<00:03:19.230> upgrade<00:03:19.440> your<00:03:19.680> guns<00:03:19.980> your<00:03:20.280> guns<00:03:20.489> are

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
need to upgrade your guns your guns are

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.979 
need to upgrade your guns your guns are
still<00:03:20.790> going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.120> dominant

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
still going to be dominant

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.539 
still going to be dominant
so<00:03:22.349> don't<00:03:22.530> upgrade<00:03:22.709> them<00:03:23.010> until<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> know<00:03:23.489> you

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
so don't upgrade them until you know you

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.670 
so don't upgrade them until you know you
get<00:03:23.819> up<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.239> round<00:03:24.510> 20<00:03:24.959> or<00:03:25.109> so<00:03:25.319> when<00:03:25.560> you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
get up to that round 20 or so when you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.170 
get up to that round 20 or so when you
when<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.160> start<00:03:26.430> needing<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.730> get<00:03:26.879> some<00:03:27.060> more

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
when you start needing to get some more

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.659 
when you start needing to get some more
ammo<00:03:27.329> again<00:03:28.139> you'll<00:03:28.319> get<00:03:28.440> máximos<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.459> nukes

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
ammo again you'll get máximos and nukes

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.729 
ammo again you'll get máximos and nukes
and<00:03:29.940> instant<00:03:30.299> kills<00:03:30.449> almost<00:03:30.840> every<00:03:31.199> round<00:03:31.409> so

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and instant kills almost every round so

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.589 
and instant kills almost every round so
it<00:03:31.799> won't<00:03:31.919> be<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.400> big<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.819> deal<00:03:33.030> alright

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
it won't be that big of a deal alright

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.199 
it won't be that big of a deal alright
time<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.199> actual<00:03:34.590> strategy<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.879> lot

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
time for the actual strategy now a lot

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.849 
time for the actual strategy now a lot
of<00:03:36.329> people<00:03:36.569> say<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.930> run<00:03:37.109> in<00:03:37.199> circles<00:03:37.349> run<00:03:37.739> in

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
of people say just run in circles run in

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.140 
of people say just run in circles run in
circles<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> best<00:03:38.579> way<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.760> go<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.090> I

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
circles is the best way to go and I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.210 
circles is the best way to go and I
agree<00:03:39.269> with<00:03:39.599> that<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:40.260> town<00:03:40.590> it's<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.980> lot

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
agree with that on town it's a lot

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
agree with that on town it's a lot
harder<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.669> run<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:41.909> circles<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.359> stay<00:03:42.569> alive

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
harder to run in circles and stay alive

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.089 
harder to run in circles and stay alive
so<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.139> going<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.319> be<00:03:43.440> telling<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.739> guys<00:03:43.859> to

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
so I'm going to be telling you guys to

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.759 
so I'm going to be telling you guys to
run<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.489> figure-eight<00:03:45.359> almost<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.290> figure<00:03:46.620> eight

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
run a figure-eight almost a figure eight

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.640 
run a figure-eight almost a figure eight
so<00:03:47.280> your<00:03:47.430> goal<00:03:47.729> is<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.299> run<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.840> two<00:03:49.440> different

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
so your goal is to run in two different

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.219 
so your goal is to run in two different
circles<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.639> mix<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.449> up<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.750> don't<00:03:51.900> have<00:03:52.049> to

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
circles and mix it up you don't have to

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.899 
circles and mix it up you don't have to
run<00:03:52.379> in<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> same<00:03:52.799> figure<00:03:53.069> eight<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.519> can<00:03:53.549> do

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
run in the same figure eight you can do

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.460 
run in the same figure eight you can do
you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.269> turn<00:03:54.419> around<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.720> run<00:03:54.810> backwards<00:03:55.319> in

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
you can turn around and run backwards in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.259 
you can turn around and run backwards in
a<00:03:55.560> circle<00:03:55.919> you<00:03:56.010> can<00:03:56.069> run<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.150> see

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
a circle you can run you can just see

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.640 
a circle you can run you can just see

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
it really is it takes down your health

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.740 
it really is it takes down your health
so<00:04:08.459> much<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:08.879> if<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:08.970> get<00:04:09.180> hit<00:04:09.359> one<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:09.659> two

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
so much and if you get hit one or two

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.869 
so much and if you get hit one or two
times<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.139> could<00:04:10.319> possibly<00:04:10.799> go<00:04:10.979> down<00:04:11.250> which

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
times you could possibly go down which

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.759 
times you could possibly go down which
you<00:04:12.060> don't<00:04:12.239> want<00:04:12.419> to<00:04:12.479> happen<00:04:12.629> so<00:04:13.349> your<00:04:13.530> best

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
you don't want to happen so your best

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.469 
you don't want to happen so your best
bet<00:04:13.889> is<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.250> constantly<00:04:14.849> run<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.299> circles

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
bet is to constantly run in circles

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.750 
bet is to constantly run in circles
between<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.620> juggernaut<00:04:17.099> building<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.699> the
