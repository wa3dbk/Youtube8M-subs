the transmission hydraulic circuit works

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.510 
the transmission hydraulic circuit works
so<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.090> see<00:02:09.239> over<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
so as you can see over here this is the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
so as you can see over here this is the
transmission<00:02:11.520> oil<00:02:11.730> through<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.480> strainer

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
transmission oil through the strainer

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.789 
transmission oil through the strainer
the<00:02:13.890> oil<00:02:14.159> is<00:02:14.340> sucked<00:02:14.670> by<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.799> transmission

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
the oil is sucked by the transmission

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.830 
the oil is sucked by the transmission
oil<00:02:16.920> pump<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.969> question<00:02:18.299> type<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.599> pump

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
oil pump so this question type of pump

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.349 
oil pump so this question type of pump
sucks<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.439> oil<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.829> this<00:02:20.340> pump<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.180> installed

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.069 
sucks the oil and this pump is installed
towards<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.819> gearbox<00:02:23.819> itself<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.659> gets

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
towards the gearbox itself and it gets

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.800 
towards the gearbox itself and it gets
its<00:02:25.260> drive<00:02:25.620> from<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> torque<00:02:26.819> converter<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
its drive from the torque converter the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.740 
its drive from the torque converter the
torque<00:02:28.109> converter<00:02:28.260> dock<00:02:28.829> is<00:02:29.269> fixed<00:02:30.269> towards

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
torque converter dock is fixed towards

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.229 
torque converter dock is fixed towards
the<00:02:30.870> cross<00:02:31.799> and<00:02:31.980> type<00:02:32.129> um<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.670> gets<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.969> drive

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the cross and type um so it gets a drive

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.089 
the cross and type um so it gets a drive
from<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.689> torque<00:02:33.930> converter<00:02:34.109> and<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.829> torque

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
from the torque converter and the torque

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.030 
from the torque converter and the torque
converter<00:02:35.250> gets<00:02:35.790> its<00:02:35.969> drive<00:02:36.239> from<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.709> engine

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
converter gets its drive from the engine

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.080 
converter gets its drive from the engine
itself<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.579> prime<00:02:38.790> mover<00:02:39.379> okay<00:02:40.639> so<00:02:41.639> as<00:02:41.819> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
itself the prime mover okay so as it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.449 
itself the prime mover okay so as it
such<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.689> oil<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.079> it<00:02:43.200> supplies<00:02:43.859> it<00:02:44.129> towards

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
such the oil and it supplies it towards

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.420 
such the oil and it supplies it towards
the<00:02:44.780> transmission<00:02:45.780> oil<00:02:45.840> filter<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
the transmission oil filter so here the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.300 
the transmission oil filter so here the
oil<00:02:47.540> get<00:02:48.540> filtered<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.260> again<00:02:49.799> gets<00:02:50.010> supplied

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
oil get filtered and again gets supplied

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.300 
oil get filtered and again gets supplied
toward<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.060> oil<00:02:52.019> pressure<00:02:52.439> maintenance<00:02:52.769> well

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
toward the oil pressure maintenance well

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.099 
toward the oil pressure maintenance well
so<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.909> actually<00:02:54.299> maintains<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> pressure

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
so this actually maintains the pressure

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.050 
so this actually maintains the pressure
over<00:02:55.409> here<00:02:55.829> which<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.370> required<00:02:56.879> for

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
over here which is required for

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.449 
over here which is required for
different<00:02:57.209> operation<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.469> here<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.099> oil<00:02:59.280> is

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
different operation from here the oil is

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.149 
different operation from here the oil is
getting<00:02:59.669> diverted<00:03:00.090> towards<00:03:00.750> two<00:03:01.560> directions

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
getting diverted towards two directions

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.940 
getting diverted towards two directions
as<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.579> see<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:03.329> flow<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.169> going<00:03:04.469> towards

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
as you can see one flow is going towards

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.490 
as you can see one flow is going towards
the<00:03:05.519> torque<00:03:05.760> converter<00:03:05.939> so<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.750> first<00:03:07.079> raises

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the torque converter so it first raises

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.119 
the torque converter so it first raises
a<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.609> torque<00:03:08.879> converter<00:03:09.060> relief<00:03:09.689> well<00:03:10.129> then

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
a the torque converter relief well then

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.970 
a the torque converter relief well then
it<00:03:12.000> reaches<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.840> torque<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.379> water<00:03:13.560> pressure

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
it reaches the torque on water pressure

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
it reaches the torque on water pressure
regulating<00:03:14.669> bail<00:03:14.879> and<00:03:15.150> finally<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:16.230> goes

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
regulating bail and finally it goes

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.379 
regulating bail and finally it goes
towards<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> torque<00:03:17.430> converter<00:03:17.579> for<00:03:18.120> its

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
towards the torque converter for its

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.869 
towards the torque converter for its
functioning<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.190> know<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.519> function<00:03:20.790> of

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
functioning so you know the function of

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.069 
functioning so you know the function of
the<00:03:20.940> relief<00:03:21.239> valve<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.629> excess<00:03:21.900> pressure

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
the relief valve so excess pressure

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.099 
the relief valve so excess pressure
comes<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.829> relief<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:24.329> particular<00:03:24.840> pressure

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
comes it relief that particular pressure

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.020 
comes it relief that particular pressure
and<00:03:25.409> through<00:03:25.949> the<00:03:26.069> return<00:03:26.340> line<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.879> see

line so it goes towards the tank the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.050 
line so it goes towards the tank the
return<00:03:38.639> line<00:03:38.819> okay<00:03:39.599> now<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.099> second<00:03:41.549> phase<00:03:41.579> of

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
return line okay now the second phase of

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.629 
return line okay now the second phase of
it<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.509> the<00:03:42.659> circuit<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.319> from<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.250> oil

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
it at the circuit going from the oil

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.670 
it at the circuit going from the oil
pressure<00:03:45.000> maintenance<00:03:45.239> well<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.319> what

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
pressure maintenance well so what

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.509 
pressure maintenance well so what
happens<00:03:47.189> is<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:48.180> moves<00:03:48.750> towards<00:03:49.409> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
happens is that that moves towards the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.659 
happens is that that moves towards the
solenoid<00:03:50.519> control<00:03:51.120> bag<00:03:51.479> okay<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:53.099> unit

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
solenoid control bag okay so this unit

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.089 
solenoid control bag okay so this unit
actually<00:03:53.819> controls<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.769> forward<00:03:55.769> reverse

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
actually controls the forward reverse

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.360 
actually controls the forward reverse
operation<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.689> transmission<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:59.040> from

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
operation of the transmission so from

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.490 
operation of the transmission so from
here<00:03:59.579> as<00:03:59.790> we<00:04:00.000> check<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.449> forward<00:04:00.750> or<00:04:01.199> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
here as we check the forward or the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.679 
here as we check the forward or the
reverse<00:04:01.829> switch<00:04:02.040> what<00:04:02.669> happens<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.239> that<00:04:03.269> the

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
reverse switch what happens is that the

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.129 
reverse switch what happens is that the
oil<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.109> means<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.590> plate<00:04:04.829> towards<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.170 
this will be encased towards the gear
for<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.859> forward<00:04:14.220> application<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.970> for

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
for the forward application and for

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.569 
for the forward application and for
reverse<00:04:15.479> where<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.870> select<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.859> oil<00:04:17.009> diverts

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
reverse where we select the oil diverts

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.249 
reverse where we select the oil diverts
to<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.789> different<00:04:18.180> position<00:04:18.299> where<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
to a different position where the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.860 
to a different position where the

forward<00:04:22.860> reverse<00:04:23.370> clutch<00:04:24.000> unit<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.740> that's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
forward reverse clutch unit so that's

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.129 
forward reverse clutch unit so that's
what's<00:04:26.430> happening

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
what's happening

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.219 
what's happening
which<00:04:27.550> reflects<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.939> gearbox<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:30.139> the

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
which reflects in the gearbox on the

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.589 
which reflects in the gearbox on the
transmission<00:04:30.830> as<00:04:31.009> we<00:04:31.520> select<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:31.909> forward<00:04:32.150> or

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
transmission as we select the forward or

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.320
