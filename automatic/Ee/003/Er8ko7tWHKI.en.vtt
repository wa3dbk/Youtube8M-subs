00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
I'm going to go ahead and take part of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.480 
I'm going to go ahead and take part of
this<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.539> fold<00:01:13.719> it<00:01:13.899> down<00:01:14.079> and<00:01:14.409> I'm<00:01:15.219> going<00:01:15.430> to

this and fold it down and I'm going to

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.160 
this and fold it down and I'm going to
just<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.789> about<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:16.000> centimeter<00:01:16.539> here<00:01:16.840> but<00:01:17.049> you

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
just do about a centimeter here but you

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.109 
just do about a centimeter here but you
can<00:01:17.380> definitely<00:01:17.619> play<00:01:18.219> around<00:01:18.520> with<00:01:18.729> how<00:01:18.880> much

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
can definitely play around with how much

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.670 
can definitely play around with how much
of<00:01:19.329> this<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.509> fold<00:01:19.899> down<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.380> you'll<00:01:20.469> see

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
of this you fold down and you'll see

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.050 
of this you fold down and you'll see
you'll<00:01:21.039> get<00:01:21.159> different<00:01:21.280> results<00:01:21.490> for

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
you'll get different results for

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.849 
you'll get different results for
everything<00:01:22.390> when<00:01:22.509> you're<00:01:22.630> done<00:01:22.899> depending<00:01:23.590> on

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
everything when you're done depending on

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.099 
everything when you're done depending on
how<00:01:24.039> much<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.700> fold<00:01:25.119> down<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:26.020> I've

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
how much of this you fold down so I've

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.599 
how much of this you fold down so I've
got<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> little<00:01:26.500> bit<00:01:26.740> folded<00:01:27.100> down<00:01:27.219> there<00:01:27.460> we'll

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
got a little bit folded down there we'll

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.940 
got a little bit folded down there we'll
just<00:01:27.759> flip<00:01:27.969> everything<00:01:28.270> over<00:01:28.750> take<00:01:29.439> that<00:01:29.649> top

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
just flip everything over take that top

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.010 
just flip everything over take that top
edge<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.700> fold<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.000> straight<00:01:31.270> into<00:01:31.719> the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
edge and fold it straight into the

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
edge and fold it straight into the
center<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.909> same<00:01:34.149> thing<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:34.719> side<00:01:34.780> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.270 

need<00:01:39.939> something<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.890> they<00:01:42.039> take

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
need something like this then they take

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.279 
need something like this then they take
the<00:01:42.490> sides<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.969> fold<00:01:43.479> into<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.960> center

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
the sides and fold into the center

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.020 
the sides and fold into the center
imagine<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:44.859> there's<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.189> line<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.549> connects

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
imagine is there's a line that connects

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.389 
imagine is there's a line that connects
between<00:01:46.179> these<00:01:46.539> two<00:01:46.719> points<00:01:46.859> now<00:01:47.859> i<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:48.310> only

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
between these two points now i can only

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.160 
between these two points now i can only
fold<00:01:48.789> into<00:01:48.999> the<00:01:49.270> center<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.689> not<00:01:49.840> going<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
fold into the center it's not going to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.870 
fold into the center it's not going to
obviously<00:01:50.320> fold<00:01:50.950> all<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.249> way<00:01:51.399> over<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
obviously fold all the way over to the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.090 
obviously fold all the way over to the
side<00:01:52.240> or<00:01:52.270> anything<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:53.439> going<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.710> fold<00:01:53.950> a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
side or anything just going to fold a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.969 
side or anything just going to fold a
little<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.429> this<00:01:54.579> over<00:01:54.969> here<00:01:55.530> match<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.770> those

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
little of this over here match up those

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.359 
little of this over here match up those
points<00:01:58.109> i'm<00:01:59.109> going<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.409> tuck<00:01:59.649> those<00:01:59.890> points

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
points i'm going to tuck those points

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.039 
points i'm going to tuck those points
right<00:02:00.579> underneath<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.210> part<00:02:01.509> we<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:01.840> made

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
right underneath that part we just made

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.809 
right underneath that part we just made
here<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:03.700> them<00:02:03.880> secure<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.630> underneath<00:02:05.819> then

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
here get them secure it underneath then

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.600 
here get them secure it underneath then
i'm<00:02:06.909> going<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> take<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:08.500> top<00:02:08.890> part<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.429> you

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
i'm going to take this top part that you

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.450 
i'm going to take this top part that you
see<00:02:09.819> here<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.470> fold<00:02:11.470> between<00:02:12.040> those<00:02:12.220> two

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
see here and fold between those two

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.380 
see here and fold between those two
points<00:02:12.490> down<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.550> there's<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.880> lot<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.120> paper

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
points down and there's a lot of paper

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.210 
points down and there's a lot of paper
so<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> might<00:02:16.960> want<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.260> kind<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.500> adjust<00:02:17.650> as

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
so you might want to kind of adjust as

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.780 
so you might want to kind of adjust as
you<00:02:18.340> do<00:02:18.490> this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
you do this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.369 
you do this
to<00:02:18.849> make<00:02:19.000> sure<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.360> get<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.659> right<00:02:19.689> there<00:02:20.140> but

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
to make sure you get it right there but

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.459 
to make sure you get it right there but
we<00:02:20.469> want<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.680> make<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.069> good<00:02:21.280> solid<00:02:21.879> crease

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
we want to make it a good solid crease

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.440 
we want to make it a good solid crease
and<00:02:23.469> then<00:02:23.530> we're<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.189> open<00:02:24.400> things<00:02:24.879> up<00:02:25.150> &amp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and then we're going to open things up &amp;

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.619 
and then we're going to open things up &amp;
open<00:02:26.170> them<00:02:26.530> up<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:27.010> sides<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.239> this

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
open them up on the sides so that this

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.720 
open them up on the sides so that this
is<00:02:28.840> going<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.109> stand<00:02:29.439> up<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.799> serve<00:02:30.129> as<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.700> of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
is going to stand up and serve as one of

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.910 
is going to stand up and serve as one of
the<00:02:30.909> edges<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:32.109> could<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.469> same<00:02:32.650> thing

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the edges and I could do the same thing

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.020 
the edges and I could do the same thing
over<00:02:33.040> here<00:02:33.159> too<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:34.930> these<00:02:35.230> two

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
over here too so that I get these two

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530 
over here too so that I get these two
sides<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:39.280> nice<00:02:39.489> space<00:02:39.879> here<00:02:40.269> where<00:02:40.450> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
sides and the nice space here where you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.199 
sides and the nice space here where you
can<00:02:40.689> light<00:02:40.930> put<00:02:41.409> things<00:02:41.650> inside<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.970> little

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
can light put things inside and a little

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.429 
can light put things inside and a little
points<00:02:43.450> here<00:02:43.599> that<00:02:43.629> could<00:02:43.900> connect<00:02:44.260> to

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
points here that could connect to

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.679 
points here that could connect to
something<00:02:44.680> if<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.040> want<00:02:45.189> them<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:46.450> gives

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
something if you want them to that gives

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.069 
something if you want them to that gives

eight centimeters long and it stands

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.780 
eight centimeters long and it stands
about<00:03:22.229> based<00:03:23.229> on<00:03:23.440> how<00:03:23.650> far<00:03:23.889> I<00:03:23.949> curved<00:03:24.400> over

about based on how far I curved over

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.460 
about based on how far I curved over
things<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.419> didn't<00:03:25.629> make<00:03:25.840> it'll<00:03:26.349> be

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
things and you didn't make it'll be

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.469 
things and you didn't make it'll be
different<00:03:26.680> depth<00:03:27.220> depending<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.909> how<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.150> did

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
different depth depending on how you did

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.520 
different depth depending on how you did
things<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:29.680> that's<00:03:29.859> how<00:03:30.010> deep<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:31.530> the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
things but that's how deep it is and the
