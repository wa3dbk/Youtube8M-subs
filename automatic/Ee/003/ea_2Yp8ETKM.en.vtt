00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 on my on the seriousness 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.729
 more I feel those languages ​​you can from 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 this i didn't have it is it was 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.689
 horrible 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 marijke you didn't have him live normally 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.720
 before and then suddenly you come out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.579
 anesthesia and then you notice that life 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.820
 no longer will be the same how respond 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.060
 you on it 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.979
 yes at first it was a lot of disbelief eyes 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.860
 actually the use of disbelief actually 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.950
 the first word or thought that uses 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.900
 and without their brands so most 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:13.160
 sensations that I thought that was possible 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:17.930
 not that that drives me a little 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.700
 excuse to go 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.700
 you try again you your future 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.810
 not a solid one very quickly 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.140
 That also means that biased her 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.870
 sexuality 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.930
 also becomes a major problem for sharing 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.380
 to my van close it just to 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.640
 made and not to it 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.190
 so it works if you if you if you are with 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.230
 sex is about it is not just it 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.410
 physical that but sometimes too dear 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.410
 words 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.040
 that this is really not possible 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 well then answer further 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.730

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 home brand specie for each other 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.090
