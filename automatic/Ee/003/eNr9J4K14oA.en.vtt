00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.830
 I will show you how to download and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.870
 install in a new mode that is called 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.739
 lv real photos 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.320
 and it's in the quality x 128 is going to 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.870
 download on a media page and the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.940
 link is in the description and you 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.820
 they will click on who to download 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.680
 we must download is a little heavy 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.580
 I think that heavy 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.740
 20 mb a little download it and here it 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.100
 just downloaded will continue as in 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.940
 a winrar can decompress it in its 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.950
 desktop or search 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.799
 and on his desk in some folder that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.710
 have and then for example I that I have 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:17.030
 windows 8 we come here 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 and we look for the percent app folder 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.979
 percent data that is where it is where 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.770
 are all minecraft files 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.210
 now you can occupy it in the folder is the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 first thing that comes out is called point 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.350
 minecraft then we go where it says 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.350
 the resource packs 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.560
 all we have to do is 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 copy it move it 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 from where they had it to here 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.150
 and so they just wait for it to end 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.150
 to pass 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.700
 ready is your 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.790
 he is already he is the mobile is the the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.400
 agreement of textures and is installed 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.090
 for this pack of textures really not 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.090
 are needed 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.959
 - It takes months to be as it does not 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.540
 although it seems it is not so heavy many 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.020
 they say this this text payment 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.960
 them is heavy but really that is what 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.090
 supports the computer easily 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.620
 but good since I already canceled 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.620
 I have the good mod here 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.879
 the textures pack 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.670
 Now I 'm going back to pay attention to myself so that 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.310
 See it 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.330
 and ready we are here this is the year 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.580
 of textures is the beginning but good 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.310
 I'm going to show here is for example in the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.240
 version 1.8 to change them go the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.140
 options 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.140
 after 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.970
 in restoring pax 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 and here comes 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 for example the east at the beginning will come out 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.010
 on this left side you click on the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.880
 arrow and it's going to happen over here they give it 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.850
 then it's going to take a little bit 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.560
 take an approximately between one and 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.500
 two minutes loading the engine since 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.750
 As I told you, it's a bit heavy but 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.820
 They are not going to encourage both the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.010
 Minecraft to me only got me 10 image 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.010
 10 fps is images per second 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.800
 and this time not 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.990
 and then now let's see let's see the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.990
 mod
