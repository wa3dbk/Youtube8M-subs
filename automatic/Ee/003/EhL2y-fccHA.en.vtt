money to do it and basically you know
try<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.059> some<00:00:45.239> low-tech<00:00:45.390> things<00:00:45.870> very

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
try it out some low-tech things very

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.500 
try it out some low-tech things very
obvious<00:00:46.530> things<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.800> sandpaper<00:00:47.510> certain

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
obvious things like sandpaper certain

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
obvious things like sandpaper certain
types<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.719> chemicals<00:00:49.250> but<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> coolest

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
types of chemicals but the coolest

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.660 
types of chemicals but the coolest
things<00:00:51.710> actually<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> few<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.250> one

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
things actually there was a few so one

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.100 
things actually there was a few so one
was<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> milling<00:00:54.390> machine<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.989> at

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
was the milling machine which I have at

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.779 
was the milling machine which I have at
etech<00:00:55.410> sort<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> reporters<00:00:56.399> everyone<00:00:56.670> she

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
etech sort of reporters everyone she

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.660 
etech sort of reporters everyone she
knows<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.969> lot<00:00:57.030> lots<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> hackerspaces<00:00:57.899> have

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
knows a lot lots of hackerspaces have

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
knows a lot lots of hackerspaces have
you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.910> their<00:01:00.059> disposal<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:01.020> actually

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you know at their disposal it's actually

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
you know at their disposal it's actually
work<00:01:01.410> pretty<00:01:01.440> well<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.219> access<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
work pretty well to get access to the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
work pretty well to get access to the
layers<00:01:03.000> even<00:01:03.539> though<00:01:03.629> boards<00:01:03.960> aren't<00:01:04.110> totally

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
layers even though boards aren't totally

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
layers even though boards aren't totally
planner<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> mess

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
planner so you kind of have to mess

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.250 
planner so you kind of have to mess
around<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> z-axis

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
around a little bit with the z-axis

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590 
around a little bit with the z-axis
height<00:01:07.710> maybe<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.580> touch-up<00:01:08.909> work<00:01:09.060> that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
height maybe do some touch-up work that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.890 
height maybe do some touch-up work that
was

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
was

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.800 
was
full<00:01:10.100> service<00:01:11.100> grinding<00:01:11.610> awesome<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.690> these

gigantic machines for finishing services

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.860 
gigantic machines for finishing services
of<00:01:15.480> metal<00:01:16.040> giant<00:01:17.390> ridiculous<00:01:18.390> size<00:01:18.570> things

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
of metal giant ridiculous size things

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.420 
of metal giant ridiculous size things
that<00:01:19.050> are<00:01:19.140> super<00:01:19.470> super<00:01:19.590> accurate<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.340> was

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that are super super accurate that was

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
that are super super accurate that was
almost<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.820> laughing<00:01:21.330> yeah<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.350> episode

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
almost like laughing yeah like episode

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
almost like laughing yeah like episode
are<00:01:23.430> basically<00:01:23.670> shaping<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:25.290> know

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
are basically shaping off you know

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
are basically shaping off you know
layers<00:01:25.620> at<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> time<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> down<00:01:27.660> in

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
layers at a time to get to get down in

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.190 
layers at a time to get to get down in
our<00:01:28.020> case<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.230> next<00:01:28.620> layer<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:29.300> copper<00:01:30.300> which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
our case the next layer of copper which

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
our case the next layer of copper which
is<00:01:31.350> awesome<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.890> 3d<00:01:32.610> x-ray<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.120> cat<00:01:33.330> scan

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
is awesome and then 3d x-ray so cat scan

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
is awesome and then 3d x-ray so cat scan
it<00:01:34.230> was<00:01:34.350> cool<00:01:34.980> because<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.460> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it was cool because you know a lot of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.250 
it was cool because you know a lot of
people<00:01:35.550> know<00:01:35.760> about<00:01:36.060> x-ray<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.870> x-rated

process<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.260> yeah<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
process and yeah that you have like you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
process and yeah that you have like you
can<00:01:50.250> slice<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.790> through<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:51.450> even<00:01:51.690> with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
can slice right through it so even with

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.150 
can slice right through it so even with
the<00:01:51.810> thin<00:01:52.080> circuit<00:01:52.440> board<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.770> slice

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
the thin circuit board you can slice

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.500 
the thin circuit board you can slice
right<00:01:53.400> through<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.910> see<00:01:54.030> individual

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
right through that and see individual

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.850 
right through that and see individual
layers<00:01:54.660> so<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.080> was<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
layers so that was I think that was the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.650 
layers so that was I think that was the
coolest<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> totally<00:01:57.240> surprised

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
coolest one just a totally surprised

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.030 
coolest one just a totally surprised
total<00:01:58.140> surprise<00:01:58.320> attacks<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
total surprise attacks where you can

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.219 
total surprise attacks where you can
work<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.310> off<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.090> gave<00:02:00.540> 45<00:02:01.020> minute

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
work it off and you just gave 45 minute

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.570 
work it off and you just gave 45 minute
talk<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.650> were<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:01.920> black<00:02:02.340> hat

the<00:03:06.790> b-sides<00:03:07.150> conference<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:08.070> basically<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the b-sides conference on basically the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.100 
the b-sides conference on basically the
b-sides<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.120> circuit<00:03:10.510> board<00:03:10.690> work<00:03:10.870> so

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
b-sides of this circuit board work so

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.170 
b-sides of this circuit board work so
the<00:03:11.260> stuff<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.590> didn't<00:03:11.860> work<00:03:11.980> but<00:03:12.730> could<00:03:13.060> be

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the stuff that didn't work but could be

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.790 
the stuff that didn't work but could be
used<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.690> different<00:03:14.080> for<00:03:14.500> different<00:03:14.560> things

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
used and different for different things

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.350 
used and different for different things
of<00:03:15.100> hardware<00:03:15.370> person<00:03:15.700> human<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.180> like

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
of hardware person human so like

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.780 
of hardware person human so like
acoustic<00:03:16.840> microscopy<00:03:17.350> tried<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> do<00:03:18.519> on<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
acoustic microscopy tried to do on the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.580 
acoustic microscopy tried to do on the
circuit<00:03:19.060> board<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.900> basically<00:03:20.470> use

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
circuit board to basically use

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.949 
circuit board to basically use
ultrasound<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.940> image<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.209> device<00:03:22.540> didn't

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
ultrasound to image the device didn't

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.280 
ultrasound to image the device didn't
work<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.290> board

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
work on the board

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.600 
work on the board
but<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.380> worked<00:03:25.530> well<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.280> look<00:03:26.460> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
but it worked well to like look the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.400 
but it worked well to like look the
epoxy<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.210> get<00:03:27.330> information<00:03:27.450> about<00:03:27.870> systems

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
epoxy and get information about systems

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.320 
epoxy and get information about systems
so<00:03:28.650> that's<00:03:29.580> not<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> b-sides

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
so that's not like the b-sides

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.870 
so that's not like the b-sides
presentation<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> b-sides<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.010> then

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
presentation of the b-sides and then

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.580 
presentation of the b-sides and then
yeah<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:33.600> was<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> other

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
yeah what was the other

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.160 
yeah what was the other
wait<00:03:36.160> for<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.430> giant<00:03:36.819> troll<00:03:37.660> bucket<00:03:38.019> too

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
wait for this giant troll bucket too

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.850 
wait for this giant troll bucket too
good<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.030> then<00:03:40.150> Thursday<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.830> a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
good I and then Thursday was a to a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.530 
good I and then Thursday was a to a
black<00:03:42.190> hat<00:03:42.400> tool<00:03:42.640> arsenal<00:03:43.150> which<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.390> actually

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
black hat tool arsenal which is actually

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.610 
black hat tool arsenal which is actually
really<00:03:43.810> cool<00:03:43.989> thing<00:03:44.200> I've<00:03:44.290> ever<00:03:44.349> done<00:03:44.500> before
