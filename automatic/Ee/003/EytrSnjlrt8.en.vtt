to have at least more than one sheet of
a<00:00:53.110> particular<00:00:53.650> design<00:00:54.010> because<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.880> like<00:00:55.060> doing

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
a particular design because I like doing

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.720 
a particular design because I like doing
modular<00:00:55.750> things<00:00:56.050> like<00:00:56.410> making<00:00:56.710> boxes<00:00:56.980> or<00:00:57.610> like

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
modular things like making boxes or like

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.930 
modular things like making boxes or like
making<00:00:58.620> Tomoko<00:00:59.620> who<00:00:59.770> says<00:01:00.040> things<00:01:00.310> kusudama

is<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.360> kind<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.660> stuff<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.050> having<00:01:02.710> just<00:01:02.829> one

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
is that kind of stuff so having just one

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.200 
is that kind of stuff so having just one
sheet<00:01:03.370> like<00:01:03.550> this<00:01:03.700> would<00:01:03.850> drive<00:01:03.970> me<00:01:04.180> crazy

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
sheet like this would drive me crazy

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.060 
sheet like this would drive me crazy
because<00:01:04.689> I'd<00:01:04.780> be<00:01:04.869> like<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.199> need<00:01:05.590> another<00:01:05.619> sheet

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
because I'd be like I need another sheet

different<00:01:19.390> designs<00:01:19.689> in<00:01:20.079> one<00:01:20.409> pack<00:01:21.039> now<00:01:22.049> this

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
different designs in one pack now this

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.469 
different designs in one pack now this
is<00:01:23.229> made<00:01:23.439> by<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:23.619> company<00:01:23.649> called<00:01:24.219> compass<00:01:25.060> and

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
is made by a company called compass and

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.459 
is made by a company called compass and
it<00:01:26.229> looks<00:01:26.469> like<00:01:26.679> it's<00:01:26.889> part<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.460> Tojo<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:28.539> so

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
it looks like it's part of Tojo and so

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.690 
it looks like it's part of Tojo and so
you<00:01:29.530> know<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.920> probably<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.280> pretty<00:01:30.490> good

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
you know it's probably a pretty good

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.859 
you know it's probably a pretty good
pretty<00:01:31.240> good<00:01:31.359> paper

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
pretty good paper

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.980 
pretty good paper
I<00:01:32.049> would<00:01:32.200> assume<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.700> can't<00:01:34.149> remember<00:01:34.539> how

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
I would assume and I can't remember how

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.020 
I would assume and I can't remember how
much<00:01:35.499> it<00:01:35.560> was<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:35.950> want<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.399> say<00:01:36.490> was<00:01:36.609> like<00:01:36.729> three

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
much it was I want to say was like three

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.029 
much it was I want to say was like three
or<00:01:37.179> four<00:01:37.359> hundred<00:01:37.479> yen<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.499> it's<00:01:38.619> really<00:01:38.799> not

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
or four hundred yen so it's really not

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.910 
or four hundred yen so it's really not
super<00:01:39.729> expensive<00:01:40.200> let's<00:01:41.200> open<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.560> up<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.799> see

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
super expensive let's open it up and see

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.660 
super expensive let's open it up and see
what<00:01:42.039> we've<00:01:42.159> got<00:01:42.369> inside<00:01:42.609> here

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
it's kind of cool how it comes in this

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.760 
it's kind of cool how it comes in this
nice<00:01:51.920> little<00:01:51.980> pouch<00:01:52.880> like<00:01:53.360> thing<00:01:53.720> here<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:54.680> you

nice way to keep your paper because I
think<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.360> one<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.290> know<00:02:03.320> evil<00:02:03.860> parts

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
think the one of the you know evil parts

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.090 
think the one of the you know evil parts
of<00:02:04.460> two<00:02:04.910> origami<00:02:05.510> paper<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:06.140> having<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> edges

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
of two origami paper is having the edges

of two origami paper is having the edges
bump<00:02:07.430> up<00:02:07.580> against<00:02:08.000> things<00:02:08.240> because<00:02:08.630> then<00:02:08.780> they

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
bump up against things because then they

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.380 
bump up against things because then they
get<00:02:09.380> bent<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.979> dented<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.700> that's<00:02:10.970> not<00:02:11.150> cool

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
get bent and dented and that's not cool

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.750 
get bent and dented and that's not cool

um<00:04:47.380> but<00:04:47.979> yeah<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.310> think<00:04:48.789> it's<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.210> really<00:04:49.449> pretty

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
um but yeah I think it's a really pretty

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.920 
um but yeah I think it's a really pretty
cool<00:04:49.960> pattern<00:04:50.410> here<00:04:50.680> I'll<00:04:50.979> go<00:04:51.220> ahead<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.930> fold

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
cool pattern here I'll go ahead and fold

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.980 
cool pattern here I'll go ahead and fold
one<00:04:53.199> up<00:04:53.350> but<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.039> thin<00:04:54.520> paper<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.419> it's

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
one up but it is a thin paper so it's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.740 
one up but it is a thin paper so it's
not<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.620> know<00:04:56.740> super<00:04:57.250> super<00:04:58.180> thick<00:04:58.449> in<00:04:58.600> any

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
not you know super super thick in any

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.219 
not you know super super thick in any
way<00:04:59.639> but<00:05:00.639> it's<00:05:01.180> probably<00:05:01.660> gonna<00:05:01.870> hold<00:05:02.080> its

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
way but it's probably gonna hold its

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.990 
way but it's probably gonna hold its
fold<00:05:02.470> pretty<00:05:02.740> good<00:05:02.889> I<00:05:02.919> here<00:05:03.160> I'm<00:05:03.280> assuming<00:05:03.430> let

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
fold pretty good I here I'm assuming let

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.570 
fold pretty good I here I'm assuming let
me<00:05:04.090> see<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:04.479> let<00:05:04.600> me<00:05:04.740> get<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> piece<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.340> I'll

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
me see here let me get a piece that I'll

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.620 
me see here let me get a piece that I'll
just<00:05:06.789> that's<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.690> pretty<00:05:07.990> spring<00:05:08.500> one<00:05:08.680> here<00:05:08.979> I

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
just that's a pretty spring one here I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.439 
just that's a pretty spring one here I
almost<00:05:10.630> don't<00:05:10.840> want<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.080> fold<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.470> because

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
almost don't want to fold it because

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.520 
almost don't want to fold it because
guess<00:05:13.449> I<00:05:13.660> won't<00:05:13.900> be<00:05:14.050> able<00:05:14.139> to<00:05:14.229> have<00:05:14.380> that

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
guess I won't be able to have that

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.950 
guess I won't be able to have that
pattern<00:05:14.770> again<00:05:15.190> cuz<00:05:15.910> there's<00:05:16.090> only<00:05:16.270> one<00:05:16.660> oh

collection for sure get this guy out of
the<00:05:23.949> way<00:05:24.130> but<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.240> is<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.389> good<00:05:25.660> thinner<00:05:26.080> kind<00:05:26.500> of

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
the way but it is a good thinner kind of

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.140 
the way but it is a good thinner kind of
paper<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.220> gonna<00:05:27.310> hold<00:05:27.490> its<00:05:27.699> crease<00:05:27.910> as<00:05:28.120> well

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
paper it's gonna hold its crease as well

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.230 
paper it's gonna hold its crease as well
but<00:05:29.110> it's<00:05:29.289> got<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:29.620> nice<00:05:29.830> sturdiness<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.789> it<00:05:30.940> so

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
but it's got a nice sturdiness to it so

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.450 
but it's got a nice sturdiness to it so
I<00:05:31.510> have<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.289> feeling<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.770> would<00:05:32.860> be<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.039> really

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460
