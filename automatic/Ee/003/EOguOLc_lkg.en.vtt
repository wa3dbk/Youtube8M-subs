apps<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:30.030> sort<00:00:31.030> of<00:00:31.120> unique<00:00:31.660> in<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.320> fact<00:00:32.529> that

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
apps are sort of unique in the fact that

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.729 
apps are sort of unique in the fact that
they<00:00:34.059> came<00:00:34.329> out<00:00:34.359> in<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.839> late<00:00:35.109> 80s<00:00:37.589> some<00:00:38.589> of

you out there may note that there were
punch<00:00:45.159> amps<00:00:45.550> as<00:00:45.670> early<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.030> the<00:00:46.359> early<00:00:46.659> 80s

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
punch amps as early as the early 80s

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.279 
punch amps as early as the early 80s
which<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:49.390> not<00:00:49.510> going<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.719> talk<00:00:50.230> about

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
which we're not going to talk about

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.989 
which we're not going to talk about
those<00:00:50.710> right<00:00:50.949> now<00:00:51.070> because<00:00:51.219> I<00:00:51.370> don't<00:00:51.519> have<00:00:51.760> any

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
those right now because I don't have any

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.229 
those right now because I don't have any
and<00:00:53.159> these<00:00:54.159> are<00:00:54.370> kind<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.699> first<00:00:54.940> ones

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
and these are kind of the first ones

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.720 
and these are kind of the first ones
that<00:00:55.480> I<00:00:55.929> used<00:00:56.379> back<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.399> eighties<00:00:57.699> so

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
that I used back in the eighties so

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.950 
that I used back in the eighties so
these<00:00:58.059> are<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> ones<00:00:58.479> that<00:00:58.569> I'm<00:00:58.719> going<00:00:58.929> to

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
these are the ones that I'm going to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.470 
these are the ones that I'm going to
talk<00:00:59.109> about<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.969> as<00:01:01.030> you<00:01:01.149> can<00:01:01.300> see<00:01:01.359> here<00:01:03.480> each

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
talk about so as you can see here each

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.390 
talk about so as you can see here each
of<00:01:04.540> these<00:01:04.720> amps<00:01:05.140> had<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.530> bass<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.160> treble

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
of these amps had the bass and treble

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.620 
of these amps had the bass and treble
controls<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.210> bass<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.810> 0-2<00:01:08.770> plus<00:01:09.190> 18<00:01:09.700> at<00:01:10.030> 45

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
controls the bass is 0-2 plus 18 at 45

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.240 
controls the bass is 0-2 plus 18 at 45
Hertz<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.640> treble<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.150> 0<00:01:13.480> to<00:01:13.600> 12<00:01:14.140> plus<00:01:14.890> 12

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
Hertz and the treble is 0 to 12 plus 12

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.150 
Hertz and the treble is 0 to 12 plus 12
and<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.580> believe<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.060> was<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.360> like<00:01:17.290> 20,000

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
and I believe that was it like 20,000

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.560 
and I believe that was it like 20,000
Hertz<00:01:18.310> pretty<00:01:18.730> high<00:01:19.680> anyway<00:01:20.680> you'll<00:01:20.890> see<00:01:21.130> here

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
Hertz pretty high anyway you'll see here

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.410 
Hertz pretty high anyway you'll see here
there<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.600> no<00:01:23.130> barrier<00:01:24.130> strip<00:01:24.670> connections

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
there is no barrier strip connections

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.770 
there is no barrier strip connections
like<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.750> new<00:01:25.900> amps<00:01:26.320> these<00:01:27.220> are<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.750> know

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
like the new amps these are you know

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.900 
like the new amps these are you know
straight<00:01:29.260> wired<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.890> most<00:01:30.070> people<00:01:30.340> use<00:01:30.580> butt

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
straight wired and most people use butt

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.980 
straight wired and most people use butt
connectors<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:32.910> those<00:01:33.910> type<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.360> connectors

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
connectors and those type of connectors

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.820 
connectors and those type of connectors
to<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:36.640> them<00:01:36.730> hooked<00:01:36.880> up<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:38.320> I'll<00:01:38.410> just<00:01:38.590> kind

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
to get them hooked up but I'll just kind

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.080 
to get them hooked up but I'll just kind
of<00:01:38.890> show<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.130> around<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.730> amp<00:01:39.850> there's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
of show you around the amp there's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.230 
of show you around the amp there's
nothing<00:01:40.360> really<00:01:41.250> nothing<00:01:42.250> really<00:01:42.580> fancy<00:01:42.850> on

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
nothing really nothing really fancy on

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.790 
nothing really nothing really fancy on
the<00:01:43.360> sides<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:45.400> may<00:01:45.580> notice<00:01:45.910> that<00:01:46.800> they're

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
the sides you may notice that they're

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.340 
the sides you may notice that they're
kind<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.130> upside-down<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.150> reason<00:01:50.050> for<00:01:50.200> this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
kind of upside-down the reason for this

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.270 
kind of upside-down the reason for this
is<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:51.310> believe<00:01:52.350> Rockford<00:01:53.350> planned<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:54.010> you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
is I believe Rockford planned on you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.890 
is I believe Rockford planned on you
mounting<00:01:54.730> these<00:01:54.880> like<00:01:55.090> underneath<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.630> seat

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
mounting these like underneath the seat

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.500 
mounting these like underneath the seat
and<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.640> would<00:01:57.850> mount<00:01:58.000> them<00:01:58.180> upside<00:01:58.480> down

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
and so you would mount them upside down

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.000 
and so you would mount them upside down
that<00:01:58.930> way<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.110> could<00:01:59.350> actually<00:01:59.530> see<00:01:59.980> the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
that way you could actually see the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.960 
that way you could actually see the
letters<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.680> guess<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:03.010> don't<00:02:03.400> know<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.730> for<00:02:03.910> a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
letters I guess I don't know that for a

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.530 
letters I guess I don't know that for a
fact

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
fact

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.590 
fact
but<00:02:05.540> anyway<00:02:05.870> there<00:02:06.560> are<00:02:06.790> two<00:02:07.790> examples<00:02:08.420> of

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
but anyway there are two examples of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.950 
but anyway there are two examples of
old-school<00:02:10.180> Rockford<00:02:11.180> Fosgate<00:02:11.330> punch

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
old-school Rockford Fosgate punch

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.850 
old-school Rockford Fosgate punch
