00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.740
 one I will show here an idea of ​​a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.769
 and was sent 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 is a central one of a s10 and talking 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.970
 that the fan did not state that the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.730
 his weakness is the fan 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.430
 so look at a simulator 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 I here is the main one of the 12 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.189
 people when you have a simulator is 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 I need to interpret an electric diagram 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.780
 This is fine tuned here, I did not 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 Whip this central here but here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.200
 I have already done it already so much by 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 Feed pump of the vehicle finally 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 What I have here is only 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.719
 really show the car 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's working 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.440
 after that i called the pin 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 corresponding to the drive 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 electro fan in case here is the a4 and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 if there are four that's here I 'm 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.430
 monitoring the electric fan as 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.010
 is showing here 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 I have here a sensor scale of 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 temperature of water that I have to 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.180
 it's 100 degrees I have to be 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 with 1.7 volts 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.100
 so here he is with him monitoring everything 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.390
 here, recording a moment that I am 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.430
 sending or the operation signal so that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.070
 the fan can be turned on 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.150
 so look, and here's my sign of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.420
 wind anthem 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.420
 Here looks just changing side 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.150
 as I change here 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.150
 I'm giving a sequence of 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:58.790
 that temperature for example 94 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.000
 the average around d2 of two votes to 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:11.060
 a point 7 or 90 to 100 degrees 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.180
 I'm going to have year or year and the whole 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 condition of the situation as if it were 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.840
 of the ready car arrived at a point 7 to 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.959
 docked at tui and 100 degrees ie the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 electronic central as it was sent 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.860
 that she was defective 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.840
 really she might even be getting married 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.519
 I did not have this monitoring that I am 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.890
 having here then is not always always 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.900
 for someone to bring you to be a 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.010
 then before you execute 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.769
 any service 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 you need to at least make sure 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.329
 that this is a real defect 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.090
 so I have total control here 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.230
 location of the electronic 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.230
 look that 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:11.660
 and I 'm becoming the most have to 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.040
 be connected not one needs to be connected 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.549
 there is no electronic central is 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.079
 energized 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.660
 that is, it is about to 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.769
 not necessarily working 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.359
 You need're working nozzle 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.320
 working spark so I can 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.540
 monitor this I can also leave 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.640
 off from rotation and without me 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.079
 have all those controls here that are 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.250
 two actuator is actuator is then I 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.049
 also has to see the same condition 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.230
 I do not necessarily need to be 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.230
 listening to the noise here me too 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.470
 I can see or just power up 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.340
 I can only energize you because the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.590
 central 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.530
 It is at the moment that it came to 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.950
 energy it is already in the beginning 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.920
 and within this standard 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.090
 the temperature sensor is also 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.410
 monitored 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.120
 Do you agree with me when you saw the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.160
 key contact it does not hold 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.720
 with whatever temperature we are going to suppose 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.340
 of 20 degrees and from 50 to 60 degrees or 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.910
 with the coming up to almost 4,2 roth 4.3 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.770
 that is, it is monitored beauty 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.530
 This is my personal idea. 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.790
 here as well as a simulation here 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.080
 that I wanted to show on the part of 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.700
 monitoring of the electric fan 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.700
 principle of its operation
