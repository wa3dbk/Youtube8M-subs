00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
 Mr.Hotsia: This is my first step. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.166
 Who came up in Thai Lue village 

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.026
 This is the house of Tai Lue. 

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:05.749
 I am coming up here. 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.049
 We are going to cook Tai Lue together. 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.478
 Let's go and see what kind of cooking they have. 

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:15.050
 Barn 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.683
 Will the barn stay in the house, right? 

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:21.398
 Tai Lue rice barn 

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:22.901
 Then went down 

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:25.197
 And that I am familiar with is 

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.239
 dried fish!!! 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.273
 Yes 

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:30.016
 Dried fish or dried fish 

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.277
 This way he called dry fish. 

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:37.852
 As we learned some words, we were right. 

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.298
 This is the kitchen. 

00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:43.327
 The ancient kitchen of the Tai Lue people will be like this. 

00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:46.462
 He will be in the house part, not separated. 

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:51.429
 And it will be in the upper floor, not on the ground floor like the people 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.454
 The tribe of the people we went to Will be on the ground floor 

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:57.241
 Of the Tai Lue people will raise the platform high 

00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.621
 And below, it is not very good to see. 

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:04.968
 But there is no pet dog. 

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.255
 But some chickens 

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.431
 He said that there is a dog. It's complicated. 

00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:11.154
 But some houses are raised 

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:16.291
 The Tai Lue village is clean, more clean than many of the villages we visit. 

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.601
 We went to look around 

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:19.234
 Eh!!! 

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:21.271
 What is his aunt doing? 

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.158
 What is this? 

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:23.553
 Aunt 

00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:24.255
 Is this a stove? 

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:25.224
 W: Aunt will wash the stove 

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:26.067
 Mr.Hotsia: Wash the stove 

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:30.191
 W: Ye 

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:30.931
 Mr.Hotsia: Oh !!! 

00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:32.556
 The stove is like this. 

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:33.878
 Keep coming new 

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:34.513
 W: Yeah 

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:35.857
 Keep coming new 

00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:38.865
 Mr.Hotsia: What does this stove do to eat the most delicious? 

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.133
 W: Jiao 

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:40.984
 Mr.Hotsia: Chiao 

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:41.447

00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:57.882
 Tai Lue 

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.011
 This is a dragonfly ball. 

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.179
 Yes 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.943
 This baby dragonfly 

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:05.621
 Phi Kasem took me to eat dragonflies. 

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.191
 Jiao Khai, the best of this world, has never been found. 

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.168
 M: A lot of protein. 

00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:10.841

 Mr.Hotsia: This one. 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.200
 Tai Lue people eat their dragonfly eggs. 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.855
 Today I will take you to the top. 

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:18.397
 What is the Lue language? 

00:02:18.397 --> 00:02:19.554
 Aunt asked for another round. 

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:21.082
 W: E 

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:21.856

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.039
 Mr.Hotsia: Okay. We come to taste each other. 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.665
 This is a roasted dragonfly ball. 

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:28.189
 Tai Lue food is very ancient. 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.271
 Remove the dragonfly 

00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.650
 The larvae come with eggs. 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.202
 Finished and then roasted 

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:38.392

 Salt has a pond 

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.556

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:07.825
 Then it will drown its wings 

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.368
 Chew into it, it will be a little cracked
