00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 plants can grow to two 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 different species multiply either 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.189
 sexually by semen so 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 generative or asexual 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.690
 individual plant parts such as 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 example by litter that would be the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 vegetative propagation what the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 differences between generative and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.199
 we are showing vegetative proliferation 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.199
 you now 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.080
 the generative multiplication is based on the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.880
 sexual reproduction that 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.220
 Basically, that means so much 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.270
 genetic material of two individuals 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.520
 combined 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.190
 This creates a new generation 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.160
 with new characteristics the genetic 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.660
 material of the new generation is 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.800
 unique that works the same way as 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 in humans 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.180
 there is also the genetic material of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.280
 two parents recombined and that 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.160
 child thus has a unique 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.440
 mixture from the genes of the parents at 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.540
 The pollen grains form the plants 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.010
 male sex cells the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.050
 female gender cells are located 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 within the seed plants of the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.370
 Plant more later 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.620
 at the naked you saw the running 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.500
 Pollination differently than the covered 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.090
 You looked naked and covered are covered 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.110
 two different plants 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.640
 categories 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 we'll explain what they are now 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.290
 Differences between are the pines 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.750
 belong to the naked one saw with them 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.240
 the seed plants are open between 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.470
 the shed of the female cones here 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.990
 shown in simplified form 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.090
 the blue ones are the seed plants and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.160
 speaks of naked one saw because the seeds 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.440
 do not plant from a flyer 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.050
 are wrapped but lying around open 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 here you see his seed to shelf paint 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.760
 enlarged shape at the top of the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.920
 exposed seed plants enters 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.290
 liquid drops through a small 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.610
 opening the pollen grains the most 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.100
 be transported across the wind 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.710
 stay dripping on this liquid 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.410
 sticking out of the pollen grains grow 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.500
 then the so-called poles hoses with 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.750
 which then the spermatocytes of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.510
 the pollenkÃ¶rnern brought to the egg cell 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 which then fertilizes the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.140
 his designation covered 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 That's why this plants 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340
 class the seed plants in a fruit 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.410
 sheet are completely enclosed 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.450
 the seed plants are here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.620
 in there and now let's have a look 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.959
 a little closer 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.510
 the pollination proceeds as follows 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.150
 the pollen grains land on the upper one 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 part of the stamp of the navel of the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.530
 bullseye then grows a great 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.950
 hose through the stamp to the seeds 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.260
 on 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.269
 get down through this tube the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.819
 male sex cells then to the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.340
 female and can fertilize these 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.220
 Here you can see the embryo sack and that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.129
 here the device is the result of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.989
 generative multiplication is the seed 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.050
 He then comes under auspicious 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.580
 conditions a new plant with 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.500
 unique genetic material and new 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.630
 characteristics the advantages of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.209
 generative multiplication are a big one 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.430
 genetic diversity and adaptive 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.959
 plants will also be on the seed 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.280
 not so easy diseases or 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.560
 transmit pests 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.599
 in vegetative proliferation 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.880
 Parts of the mother plant for evaluation 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.560
 brought how it should work 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.690
 looks easy on your next video 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.370
 click on it we hope the video has 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.000
 Failed if Egypt thumbs 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.739
 up 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.739
 three people until then and ciao
