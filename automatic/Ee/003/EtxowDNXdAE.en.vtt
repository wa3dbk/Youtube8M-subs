older<00:00:45.660> design<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.940> I've<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.390> similar<00:00:48.989> to

older design and I've got one similar to
this<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> uses<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.730> modern<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> kind<00:00:51.690> of

this but it uses more modern and kind of
cheaper<00:00:52.320> stuff<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:53.520> pesky<00:00:54.449> if'

a35<00:01:25.799> z5<00:01:26.549> tube<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.500> designed<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a35 z5 tube is I think designed so that

a35 z5 tube is I think designed so that
the<00:01:30.960> circuit<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.560> opened<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.520> case<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the circuit will be opened in case of a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
the circuit will be opened in case of a
short<00:01:35.390> because<00:01:36.390> looking<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> schematic

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
short because looking at the schematic

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.870 
short because looking at the schematic
here<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.820> AC<00:01:39.299> power<00:01:40.310> flows<00:01:41.310> through<00:01:41.579> both<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
here all AC power flows through both the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
here all AC power flows through both the
dial<00:01:42.119> lamp<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> part<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> filament<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
dial lamp and part of the filament to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
dial lamp and part of the filament to
get<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> plate<00:01:45.110> there's<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.380> direct

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get up to the plate there's no direct

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.060 
get up to the plate there's no direct
connection<00:01:47.100> between<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.820> AC<00:01:47.970> line<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
connection between the AC line and the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
connection between the AC line and the
plate<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.149> acts<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> fusible

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
plate and so this acts as a fusible

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.880 
plate and so this acts as a fusible
resistor<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
resistor to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.910 
resistor to
help<00:01:55.640> protect<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:56.990> case<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.410> short<00:01:57.440> but

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
help protect in the case of a short but

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.820 
help protect in the case of a short but
I<00:01:57.980> wanted<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.640> doubly<00:01:59.450> sure<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.930> we<00:02:00.350> have

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I wanted to be doubly sure that we have

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.700 
I wanted to be doubly sure that we have
protection<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.910> put<00:02:02.120> a<00:02:02.150> actual<00:02:03.110> fuse<00:02:03.440> in

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
protection so it put a actual fuse in

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.940 
protection so it put a actual fuse in
the<00:02:03.800> circuit<00:02:04.280> tube<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:06.140> we<00:02:06.530> put<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:06.920> new

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the circuit tube and we put all new

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.140 
the circuit tube and we put all new
capacitors<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.520> one<00:02:10.520> thing<00:02:10.790> was<00:02:11.000> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
capacitors in it and one thing was that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.300 
capacitors in it and one thing was that
I<00:02:11.300> think<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.630> mouse<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.110> Eton<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.470> wiring<00:02:13.100> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I think a mouse at Eton the wiring the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.950 
I think a mouse at Eton the wiring the
old<00:02:13.580> wire<00:02:13.850> on<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.330> that's<00:02:14.540> why<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.720> had<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
old wire on it that's why I had to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.820 
old wire on it that's why I had to
replace<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:17.210> three<00:02:17.390> 5z5<00:02:17.960> tube<00:02:18.560> had

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
replace it and the three 5z5 tube had

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.420 
replace it and the three 5z5 tube had
shorted<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.860> filament

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
shorted and I think the filament

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.180 
shorted and I think the filament
filament<00:02:23.330> had<00:02:23.750> shorted<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.470> burned<00:02:24.680> open

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
filament had shorted out and burned open

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.580 
filament had shorted out and burned open
and<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.510> when<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.750> first<00:02:26.930> plugged<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
and so when I first plugged it in the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.170 
and so when I first plugged it in the
dial<00:02:27.830> lamp<00:02:28.070> shorted<00:02:28.460> right<00:02:28.640> out<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.880> think

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
dial lamp shorted right out I think

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.200 
dial lamp shorted right out I think
because<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.690> short<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.670> scent

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
because of the short and the the scent

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.680 
because of the short and the the scent
didn't<00:02:32.450> power<00:02:32.690> up<00:02:33.050> because<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:34.330> tube<00:02:35.330> had

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
didn't power up because the tube had

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.980 
didn't power up because the tube had
blown<00:02:36.410> open<00:02:36.890> because<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.370> short<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> new

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
blown open because of a short so a new

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.010 
blown open because of a short so a new
tube<00:02:39.290> was<00:02:39.500> needed<00:02:39.830> for<00:02:39.860> this<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:40.520> otherwise

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
tube was needed for this one otherwise

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.640 
tube was needed for this one otherwise
it's<00:02:42.020> all<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.410> original<00:02:43.010> tubes<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:45.350> dial

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's all the original tubes the dial

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.910 
it's all the original tubes the dial
cord<00:02:46.070> on<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:47.540> one<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.260> little<00:02:48.680> bit

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
cord on this this one is a little bit

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520 
cord on this this one is a little bit
different<00:02:49.370> than<00:02:49.580> similar<00:02:50.030> ones<00:02:50.209> I've<00:02:50.420> seen

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
different than similar ones I've seen

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.580 
different than similar ones I've seen
this<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.740> just<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.070> spring-loaded<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
this is just a spring-loaded see if you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.380 
this is just a spring-loaded see if you
can<00:02:54.740> see<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.100> here<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.370> just<00:02:55.730> operates<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
can see it here this just operates on a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.560 
can see it here this just operates on a
spring<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:58.370> some<00:02:58.640> spring<00:02:58.940> tension<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
spring there's some spring tension on it

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.979 
spring there's some spring tension on it
and<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.989> actually<00:03:00.500> moves<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.890> dial<00:03:01.130> pointer

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
and that actually moves the dial pointer

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.250 
and that actually moves the dial pointer
and<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.440> hook<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.070> up<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.600> works<00:03:05.840> kind

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and I hook this up so that it works kind

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.610 
and I hook this up so that it works kind
of<00:03:06.350> like<00:03:06.560> those<00:03:07.360> FM<00:03:08.360> tuners<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.380> might

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
of like those FM tuners that you might

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.479 
of like those FM tuners that you might
have<00:03:10.010> seen<00:03:10.340> those<00:03:11.209> type<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.780> use<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.489> pool

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
have seen those type that use a pool

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.600 
have seen those type that use a pool
type<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.300> variable<00:03:14.780> inductor<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:16.010> Conny<00:03:16.310> that

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
type of variable inductor the Conny that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.670 
type of variable inductor the Conny that
you<00:03:16.670> kind<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.000> pull<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.300> string<00:03:17.900> there's<00:03:18.410> you

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you kind of pull a string there's you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.430 
you kind of pull a string there's you
know<00:03:18.739> some<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.220> those<00:03:19.310> FM<00:03:19.730> modules<00:03:20.300> use<00:03:21.170> that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
know some of those FM modules use that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.150 
know some of those FM modules use that
string<00:03:21.830> type<00:03:22.190> system<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.620> is<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
string type system so this just is the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.400 
string type system so this just is the
tuning<00:03:26.050> as<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:27.290> tuning<00:03:27.769> wheel<00:03:27.950> turns<00:03:29.410> just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
tuning as this tuning wheel turns just

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.800 
tuning as this tuning wheel turns just
pulls<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.980> this<00:03:31.190> little<00:03:31.459> piece<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.209> dial<00:03:32.420> cord

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
pulls on this little piece of dial cord

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.840 
pulls on this little piece of dial cord
which<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.200> pulls<00:03:33.500> on<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.860> dial<00:03:34.100> mechanism

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
which then pulls on the dial mechanism

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.759 
which then pulls on the dial mechanism
and<00:03:35.150> holds<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.050> at<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> right<00:03:36.440> place<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.280> made<00:03:38.060> a

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
and holds it at the right place I made a

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.040 
and holds it at the right place I made a
loop<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.459> knotted<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.750> the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
loop in this and knotted it so the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.800 
loop in this and knotted it so the
chassis<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:42.739> be<00:03:42.920> removed<00:03:43.430> from<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.209> cabinet

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
chassis can be removed from the cabinet

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.340 
chassis can be removed from the cabinet
for<00:03:45.530> servicing<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.400> also<00:03:47.360> had<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> repair<00:03:48.230> the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
for servicing I also had to repair the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.009 
for servicing I also had to repair the
wiring<00:03:48.890> going<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> loop<00:03:49.670> antenna<00:03:50.019> it's

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
wiring going to the loop antenna it's

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.060 
wiring going to the loop antenna it's
kind<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.320> an<00:03:51.440> early<00:03:51.620> style<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.400> loop<00:03:52.610> antenna

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
kind of an early style of loop antenna

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.260 
kind of an early style of loop antenna
usually<00:03:55.070> they're<00:03:55.310> built<00:03:55.550> into<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.030> back

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
usually they're built into the back

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.700 
usually they're built into the back
cabinet<00:03:56.990> or<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.350> back<00:03:58.040> panel<00:03:58.610> or<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.880> radio

but<00:04:00.710> this<00:04:00.890> one<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.310> just<00:04:01.340> kind<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.180> mounted

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
but this one is just kind of mounted

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.010 
but this one is just kind of mounted
inside<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.930> bakelite<00:04:03.380> cabinet<00:04:04.630> now<00:04:05.630> I'm

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
inside the bakelite cabinet now I'm

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.250 
inside the bakelite cabinet now I'm
going<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.290> turn<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.620> over<00:04:06.800> here<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.900> can<00:04:08.900> see

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
going to turn it over here you can see

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.680 
going to turn it over here you can see
what's<00:04:09.560> inside<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:12.530> turn<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.580> light<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:14.060> here

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
what's inside we turn the light on here

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.729 
what's inside we turn the light on here
I<00:04:17.530> guess<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> light<00:04:18.830> isn't<00:04:19.040> plugged<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.670> let's

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I guess the light isn't plugged in let's

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.600 
I guess the light isn't plugged in let's
see<00:04:21.739> here<00:04:22.540> it's<00:04:23.540> kind<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.870> strange<00:04:24.260> oh<00:04:24.680> well<00:04:25.580> I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
see here it's kind of strange oh well I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.970 
see here it's kind of strange oh well I
think<00:04:25.730> we<00:04:26.000> can<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.510> think<00:04:26.930> we<00:04:27.050> can<00:04:27.260> probably<00:04:27.440> see

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
think we can I think we can probably see

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.730 
think we can I think we can probably see

more<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.480> I<00:05:05.810> got<00:05:06.350> down<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.800> about<00:05:06.980> 0.04<00:05:07.760> 7<00:05:08.300> but

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
more but I got down to about 0.04 7 but

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.860 
more but I got down to about 0.04 7 but
you'd<00:05:09.230> still<00:05:09.560> get<00:05:09.770> some<00:05:10.630> oscillation<00:05:11.630> type

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
you'd still get some oscillation type

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.610 
you'd still get some oscillation type
noise<00:05:12.170> because<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.690> tuning<00:05:14.690> capacitor<00:05:14.840> here

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
rather than a circuit ground so in order

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.190 
rather than a circuit ground so in order
to<00:05:22.280> get<00:05:22.520> an<00:05:22.670> RF<00:05:23.000> ground<00:05:23.300> path<00:05:23.630> you've<00:05:23.900> got<00:05:24.050> to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
to get an RF ground path you've got to

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.990 
to get an RF ground path you've got to
go<00:05:24.290> through<00:05:24.320> this<00:05:25.120> RC<00:05:26.120> network<00:05:26.600> here<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.970> I

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
go through this RC network here so I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.540 
go through this RC network here so I
went<00:05:29.930> ahead<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.230> used<00:05:30.350> point<00:05:30.830> one<00:05:31.040> point<00:05:31.400> one

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
went ahead and used point one point one

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.470 
went ahead and used point one point one
seems<00:05:32.150> to<00:05:32.480> work<00:05:32.690> good<00:05:33.020> enough<00:05:33.760> but<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:35.120> think<00:05:35.360> it

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
seems to work good enough but I think it

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.390 
seems to work good enough but I think it
would<00:05:35.630> offer<00:05:35.810> less<00:05:36.170> leakage<00:05:36.470> current<00:05:37.160> from

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
would offer less leakage current from

the power line onto the chassis and then
also<00:05:40.820> for<00:05:41.240> additional<00:05:41.810> safety<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:43.190> put<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.090> on

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210

new<00:06:15.050> here<00:06:15.440> I<00:06:15.470> actually<00:06:15.860> got<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:16.430> computer

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
new here I actually got a computer

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.490 
new here I actually got a computer
that's<00:06:18.980> got<00:06:19.220> some<00:06:19.490> more<00:06:19.670> RAM<00:06:19.970> in<00:06:20.480> it<00:06:20.690> and<00:06:21.290> so

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
that's got some more RAM in it and so

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.930 
that's got some more RAM in it and so
I'm<00:06:21.650> going<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.920> stop<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.520> recording<00:06:23.240> here<00:06:24.940> my

I'm going to stop the recording here my

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.730 
I'm going to stop the recording here my

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
if that doesn't work I may just do this

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.430 
if that doesn't work I may just do this
as<00:06:27.920> two<00:06:28.160> separate<00:06:28.610> videos<00:06:29.030> I<00:06:29.270> might<00:06:29.450> even<00:06:29.630> do

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
as two separate videos I might even do

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.290 
as two separate videos I might even do
that<00:06:30.650> anyway<00:06:31.070> just<00:06:31.220> for<00:06:31.340> convenience<00:06:31.640> but<00:06:32.210> I

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
that anyway just for convenience but I

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.390 
that anyway just for convenience but I
might<00:06:32.510> see<00:06:32.750> if<00:06:32.870> I<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.230> edit<00:06:33.410> it<00:06:33.710> together<00:06:33.890> into

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
might see if I can edit it together into

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.730 
might see if I can edit it together into
one<00:06:34.790> I'm<00:06:35.780> going<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.080> put<00:06:36.290> it<00:06:36.380> all<00:06:36.530> back

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
one I'm going to put it all back

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.430 
one I'm going to put it all back
together<00:06:37.010> here<00:06:37.760> and<00:06:37.940> give<00:06:38.690> a<00:06:38.720> demonstration

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
together here and give a demonstration

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.010 
together here and give a demonstration
of<00:06:39.830> it
