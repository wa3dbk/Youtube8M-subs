underneath the chin and then I'm going
to<00:02:31.560> put<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.890> little<00:02:32.160> bit<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> detail<00:02:32.730> with

the<00:02:33.000> nostrils<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.020> add<00:02:34.500> them<00:02:34.740> up

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the nostrils just so I can add them up

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
the nostrils just so I can add them up
kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> flaring<00:02:35.520> out<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.820> little<00:02:36.120> bit<00:02:36.240> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
kind of flaring out a little bit and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.120 
kind of flaring out a little bit and
some<00:02:36.750> dimples<00:02:37.140> around<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> edges<00:02:37.950> so

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130

adding in the the the lip light and I
did<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.110> actually<00:03:16.470> looking<00:03:16.800> at<00:03:16.920> my<00:03:17.040> own<00:03:17.160> face

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
did this actually looking at my own face

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.199 
did this actually looking at my own face
just<00:03:17.760> made<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> snarl<00:03:18.660> 'if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.320> know<00:03:19.910> face<00:03:20.910> in

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
just made a snarl 'if you know face in

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.280 
just made a snarl 'if you know face in
the<00:03:21.360> mirror<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:22.920> just<00:03:23.130> drew<00:03:23.400> what<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> see

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
the mirror and then just drew what I see

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.330 
the mirror and then just drew what I see
basically<00:03:25.290> getting<00:03:25.560> better<00:03:25.890> at<00:03:26.130> drawing

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
basically getting better at drawing

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.270 
basically getting better at drawing
anything<00:03:26.850> not<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.390> lips<00:03:27.870> are<00:03:28.080> young<00:03:29.070> people

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
anything not just lips are young people

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
anything not just lips are young people
but<00:03:29.670> whatever<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.180> want<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.390> draw<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.780> just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
but whatever you want to draw it's just

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.070 
but whatever you want to draw it's just
going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> take<00:03:31.650> practice<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:33.120> again<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.019> I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
going to take practice so again and I

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.990 
going to take practice so again and I
felt<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.739> I'm<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> broken<00:03:35.670> record

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
felt kind of like I'm a broken record

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.660 
felt kind of like I'm a broken record
but<00:03:36.239> really<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.590> biggest<00:03:38.190> thing

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
but really this is the biggest thing

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.610 
but really this is the biggest thing
that<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:39.959> people<00:03:40.200> asking<00:03:40.590> me

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
all the time what can I do to get better

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.350

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
time and you'll slowly find that as you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.210 
time and you'll slowly find that as you
