00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 so here I put the balloon under 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.670
 33 liters spare tire I repeat small one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 took 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 why a little general refueling 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 now every corner he is big not 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.830
 need where not to soar in general once 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.490
 always spent why lose it extra 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.490
 on loading on the back of the machine 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:38.340
 33 liters for what to get 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.530
 flush trunk i think you already 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.640
 faced with the fact that a little balloon 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.600
 more in the end when the carpet you lay but 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.620
 here boulard turns balloon sticks out 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.829
 so it's better to take a little less 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.829
 the can he flush lie down with the floor 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 I primitively turned off the receiver 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:12.659
 through the hole there is a hole 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.530
 only the highway went there well i'm here i'm 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.960
 put that is the filling valve itself in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 the trunk did 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.360
 there is a very convenient place 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 bracket ie two screws 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.750
 drill a mounting plate 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.140
 screwed a tube here put a tube 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.369
 I will cover with thick felt so that nothing 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.649
 rubbing here in general it will walk all 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.740
 hide rug it closes not 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.970
 much that little bit of it can be seen but i think 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 not scary that's why here to valve 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.280
 set it was possible to withdraw it not 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.259
 the question that is the hole allows here 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.670
 10 more tubes push it up just 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:08.410
 the road such that yesterday I washed the car 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.680
 today is all dirty she imagine 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.150
 where is this valve put as it 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.180
 put permanent dirt will be so 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.370
 nice not always like me 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.819
 clean trunk opened refueled yes 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.840
 and all 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.360
 Multivalve I took this stuffy stuff 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 so here I do not have this arrow 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 see not need in general the sho 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.100
 here you will not look when rugs all 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.660
 it closes who will climb here 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.019
 watch dolls in a balloon 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.329
 that brushing up money saved on it would take 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.640
 ear balloon and multivalve it was all 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.739
 normal condition only these 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.579
 I bought two valves right there 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.049
 PTFE and gaskets new 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.239
 I put it like a valve, I 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.810
 went over everything else there is nothing 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.600
 there is no such terrible and grandmother 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.109
 put save a ton of money on it 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.109
 business
