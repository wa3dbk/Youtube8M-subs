00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.460 
play I got an opportunity to appreciate
that<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.789> especially<00:04:58.690> being<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.990> goalie<00:04:59.199> it's

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
that and especially being a goalie it's

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.560 
that and especially being a goalie it's
not<00:04:59.620> easy<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.949> watch<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.370> had<00:05:00.850> with<00:05:01.000> my<00:05:01.150> parents

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
difference between not being in

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.550 
difference between not being in
Vancouver<00:05:30.550> like<00:05:30.699> 2010<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.720> long<00:05:32.020> way<00:05:32.289> away<00:05:32.410> from

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
Vancouver like 2010 a long way away from

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.460 
Vancouver like 2010 a long way away from
North<00:05:33.010> America<00:05:33.160> and<00:05:33.580> Sochi<00:05:34.470> international

ice<00:05:35.620> maybe<00:05:35.919> different<00:05:36.400> surroundings<00:05:36.880> will<00:05:37.210> it

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
ice maybe different surroundings will it

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.820 
ice maybe different surroundings will it
be<00:05:37.449> a<00:05:37.479> little<00:05:37.720> easier<00:05:37.840> for<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.349> guys<00:05:38.560> you

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
be a little easier for you guys you

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.680 
be a little easier for you guys you
think<00:05:38.889> to<00:05:39.250> be<00:05:39.460> together<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.060> not<00:05:40.180> have<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.539> be

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
think to be together and not have to be

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.719 
think to be together and not have to be
a<00:05:40.720> part<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.590> masses<00:05:42.039> like<00:05:42.070> maybe<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.610> were

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
a part of the masses like maybe you were

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.700 
a part of the masses like maybe you were
there<00:05:43.030> you<00:05:43.539> know<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.659> think<00:05:43.780> there's<00:05:44.199> pros<00:05:44.680> and

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
there you know I think there's pros and

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.950 
there you know I think there's pros and
cons<00:05:44.919> I<00:05:45.190> think<00:05:45.370> definitely<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.330> Vancouver<00:05:46.810> we

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
cons I think definitely in Vancouver we

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.899 
cons I think definitely in Vancouver we
were<00:05:47.080> given<00:05:48.070> every<00:05:48.159> opportunity<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.820> be

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
were given every opportunity to be

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.460 
were given every opportunity to be
successful<00:05:49.120> you<00:05:49.750> know<00:05:49.960> from<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.229> dressing

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
successful you know from the dressing

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.960 
successful you know from the dressing
room<00:05:50.770> accommodations<00:05:50.979> everything<00:05:51.789> like<00:05:51.940> that

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
room accommodations everything like that

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.320 
room accommodations everything like that
but<00:05:52.470> having<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.590> team<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.919> get<00:05:54.070> there<00:05:54.250> I<00:05:54.280> think

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
but having the team to get there I think

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.490 
but having the team to get there I think
you<00:05:55.330> know<00:05:55.419> a<00:05:55.449> little<00:05:55.630> bit<00:05:55.780> more<00:05:55.840> because<00:05:56.320> of

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
you know a little bit more because of

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.689 
you know a little bit more because of
you<00:05:56.800> know<00:05:56.889> the<00:05:56.979> way<00:05:57.070> it's<00:05:57.250> set<00:05:57.400> up<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.639> think

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
you know the way it's set up I think

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.029 
you know the way it's set up I think
that<00:05:57.940> could<00:05:58.060> be<00:05:58.090> a<00:05:58.180> good<00:05:58.360> thing<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.949> you<00:05:59.949> know

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
that could be a good thing and you know

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.320 
that could be a good thing and you know
in<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.159> short-term<00:06:00.430> event<00:06:00.789> like<00:06:00.940> that<00:06:00.970> the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
in a short-term event like that the

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.120 
in a short-term event like that the
sooner<00:06:02.050> you<00:06:02.139> can<00:06:02.229> come<00:06:02.380> together<00:06:02.530> I<00:06:02.770> think<00:06:02.889> the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
sooner you can come together I think the

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.250 
sooner you can come together I think the
better<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:03.610> I'm<00:06:04.449> sure<00:06:04.630> that's<00:06:04.840> something<00:06:04.930> that

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
better so I'm sure that's something that

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.290 
better so I'm sure that's something that
everyone's<00:06:05.560> thought<00:06:05.770> about<00:06:05.979> but<00:06:06.280> you<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.150> we

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
everyone's thought about but you know we

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.760 
everyone's thought about but you know we
have<00:06:07.419> some<00:06:07.659> some<00:06:07.900> different<00:06:08.229> challenges<00:06:08.620> but

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
have some some different challenges but

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.589 
have some some different challenges but
