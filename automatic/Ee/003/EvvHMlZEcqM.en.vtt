and<00:00:30.259> this<00:00:30.410> thing<00:00:30.619> run<00:00:30.829> very<00:00:31.070> slow<00:00:31.310> to<00:00:31.369> begin

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
and this thing run very slow to begin

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.479 
and this thing run very slow to begin
with<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.269> was<00:00:32.390> suspecting<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:33.110> is

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
with and I was suspecting that is

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.570 
with and I was suspecting that is
nearing<00:00:34.489> failure<00:00:35.559> and<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.710> only<00:00:36.830> sounds<00:00:37.370> worse

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
nearing failure and it only sounds worse

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.000 
nearing failure and it only sounds worse
by<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:37.940> minute

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
by the minute

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.160 
by the minute
lots<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.160> clicking<00:00:40.550> sounds<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.210> as<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.050> heard

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
lots of clicking sounds and as you heard

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.540 
lots of clicking sounds and as you heard
those<00:00:42.320> noises<00:00:43.600> so<00:00:44.600> basically<00:00:45.110> this<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:45.589> a<00:00:46.190> good

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
those noises so basically this is a good

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.310 
those noises so basically this is a good
reason<00:00:46.850> why<00:00:47.059> it's<00:00:47.360> important<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.839> backup<00:00:48.170> your

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
reason why it's important to backup your

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.719 
reason why it's important to backup your
files<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.860> you<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:48.949> on<00:00:49.250> your<00:00:49.280> computer

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
files and you can on your computer

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.600 
files and you can on your computer
special<00:00:50.119> laptop<00:00:50.299> on<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.379> very<00:00:51.559> often<00:00:51.890> basis<00:00:54.610> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
special laptop on a very often basis and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.340 
special laptop on a very often basis and
right<00:00:55.790> now<00:00:55.970> I'm<00:00:56.180> trying<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:56.629> backup<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.110> files

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
right now I'm trying to backup the files

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.780 
right now I'm trying to backup the files
off<00:00:57.589> this<00:00:57.769> thing<00:00:57.979> I'm<00:00:58.129> not<00:00:58.190> sure<00:00:58.430> if<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.610> hard

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
off this thing I'm not sure if this hard

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.429 
off this thing I'm not sure if this hard
drives<00:00:59.059> going<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.510> make<00:00:59.690> it<00:00:59.809> long<00:00:59.960> enough

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:00.439 
drives going to make it long enough

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:03.009 
drives going to make it long enough
I<00:01:00.670> got<00:01:01.670> overhead<00:01:02.119> just<00:01:02.150> slower<00:01:02.600> or<00:01:02.809> half<00:01:02.989> the

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
I got overhead just slower or half the

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.490 
I got overhead just slower or half the
files<00:01:03.290> backed<00:01:03.650> up<00:01:03.860> only<00:01:04.580> 3.3<00:01:05.510> 2<00:01:05.659> gigs<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:06.380> it's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
files backed up only 3.3 2 gigs but it's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.480 
files backed up only 3.3 2 gigs but it's
taking<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.950> long<00:01:07.189> time<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.979> there<00:01:09.979> just<00:01:10.189> went

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
taking a long time and there just went

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.460 
taking a long time and there just went
so<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.180> guys<00:01:11.390> just<00:01:11.420> got<00:01:11.689> to<00:01:11.810> see<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> hard<00:01:12.229> drive

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
so you guys just got to see a hard drive

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.280 
so you guys just got to see a hard drive
fail<00:01:15.460> hard<00:01:16.460> disk<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:16.970> done<00:01:17.240> blue<00:01:17.930> screen<00:01:18.259> of

fail hard disk is done blue screen of

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.370 
fail hard disk is done blue screen of
death

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.300 

shut<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> computer<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.890> I'll<00:01:26.070> start<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
shut the computer off I'll start a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
shut the computer off I'll start a
backup

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460 

I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:34.740> hard<00:01:34.920> drive<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.310> done

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.389 

I<00:01:38.500> think<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.220> locked<00:01:39.490> up

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.459 

because<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.000> can<00:01:43.149> put<00:01:43.329> my<00:01:43.450> hand<00:01:43.960> dryer<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.289> don't

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
because I can put my hand dryer I don't

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:45.810 
because I can put my hand dryer I don't
feel<00:01:44.619> any<00:01:44.740> vibration<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.579> hard-disk

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
feel any vibration of the hard-disk

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.300 
feel any vibration of the hard-disk
Drive<00:01:46.179> has<00:01:46.359> just<00:01:46.600> locked<00:01:46.840> up<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.740> computer<00:01:48.159> is

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
Drive has just locked up the computer is

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.359 
Drive has just locked up the computer is
taking<00:01:48.670> longer<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.030> respond<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.750> post<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:51.189> you

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.190 
taking longer to respond and post as you
see<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:52.030> didn't<00:01:52.299> even<00:01:52.390> beat<00:01:52.539> off<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.780> hard

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
see it didn't even beat off the hard

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.219 
see it didn't even beat off the hard
drive<00:01:53.259> is<00:01:53.619> trying<00:01:53.829> to<00:01:53.890> boot<00:01:54.039> off<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.219> land<00:01:54.549> so

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
drive is trying to boot off the land so

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.370 
drive is trying to boot off the land so
this<00:01:56.229> hard<00:01:56.500> drive<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:56.799> cooked<00:01:58.200> first<00:01:59.200> time

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
this hard drive just cooked first time

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.959 
this hard drive just cooked first time
we<00:01:59.500> caught<00:01:59.709> a<00:01:59.740> hard<00:02:00.009> drive<00:02:00.219> failing<00:02:00.549> on<00:02:00.640> video

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
we caught a hard drive failing on video

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.199 
we caught a hard drive failing on video
but<00:02:01.959> yeah<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:02.369> explains<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.549> importance<00:02:04.030> of

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
but yeah this explains the importance of

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.459 
but yeah this explains the importance of
keeping<00:02:04.390> your<00:02:04.600> hard<00:02:04.899> drive

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
keeping your hard drive

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you're moving around because hard drives

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.520 
you're moving around because hard drives
are<00:02:12.370> very<00:02:12.519> fragile<00:02:12.879> do<00:02:13.690> not<00:02:13.870> slam<00:02:14.200> your<00:02:14.349> heart

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
