 Text or 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 everything can come 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.650

 Minute Sven less 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 so you can almost let it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 often become 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 Well, now it would be even more demanding 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 Furthermore, you can have such a dream 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 Soon you will get the user and level weather 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.370

 the last room 14 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.159
 it's all about channels 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.929
 alone Ellison is currently still active and war on now 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.639
 Save selection as a channel 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.479
 that pilots at new Alto Channel 1 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.189

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.489
 be active 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.339
 so tight that easy now 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.749
 Percent of all jobs it is transparent and all I know is 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.749
 there it is still visible 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.989
 Veiel that just everything 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:46.860

 right, too 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.759
 and it was already me 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.119
 so in fact is Gone again using the image 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.859

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.799
 and ready-made PNG yet 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.809
 So you have painted a picture 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.079
 Crying is always for the Lobo 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.899
 is clear 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.459
 others advertised 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.509
 by creating new levels 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.799
 and put those under 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.849

 or is she 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.989
 Already now I can often go at the end 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.459
 the rounds on selection 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.469
 can save from it 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.180
 and now I activate the simple Alliander I disable 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.789
 you can not see that either 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.629
 visible blackness 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.349

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.219
 nothing is copying yet 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
 okay now back to 32 percent 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.939

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.219
 All of a sudden, just go short 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:27.219
 now only have to show briefly 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 here the logo transparency 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.360
 Soy the bad recording quality I have to apologize now but then 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.710
 It simply is not the means with the program 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.110
 as easy as possible 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.129
 but should serve only briefly for illustration 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.459
 so it's not so fast if you could understand everything I did 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:49.800
 have made 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.949
