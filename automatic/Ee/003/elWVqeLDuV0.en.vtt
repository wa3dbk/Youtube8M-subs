00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.719 
financially he won't get the reward in
terms<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.530> legacy<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.340> he<00:01:56.430> went<00:01:56.580> out

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
terms of legacy because if he went out

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.410 
terms of legacy because if he went out
there<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.740> managed<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> upset<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.520> miguel

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.350 
there and he managed to upset a miguel
cotto<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:01.080> Pacquiao<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.710> Floyd<00:02:02.090> he<00:02:03.090> probably

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
cotto or Pacquiao or Floyd he probably

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
cotto or Pacquiao or Floyd he probably
wouldn't<00:02:03.780> make<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.170> much<00:02:04.320> money<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.820 
wouldn't make as much money in that
fight<00:02:05.250> as<00:02:05.810> he<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:06.960> fight<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> kill<00:02:07.409> brocket

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
fight as he would fight and kill brocket

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.720 
fight as he would fight and kill brocket
let's<00:02:08.009> say<00:02:08.159> Wembley<00:02:08.689> but<00:02:10.129> legacy<00:02:11.129> wise<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
let's say Wembley but legacy wise it

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.800 
let's say Wembley but legacy wise it
would<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:12.120> way<00:02:12.900> better

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
would be way better

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.740 
would be way better
than<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.290> jail<00:02:14.500> Brooke<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.849> maybe<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.690> not

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
than be in jail Brooke so maybe it's not

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.110 
than be in jail Brooke so maybe it's not
about<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.290> money<00:02:17.319> for<00:02:17.560> me<00:02:17.770> Akon<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.459> much<00:02:18.970> as

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
it's about a legacy at this stage of his

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's about a legacy at this stage of his
career<00:02:21.340> maybe<00:02:21.730> he's<00:02:21.940> looking<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.330> retire

remember<00:02:23.110> Aamir<00:02:23.349> Khan<00:02:23.590> early<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.160> his

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
remember Aamir Khan early on in his

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.830 
remember Aamir Khan early on in his
career<00:02:24.370> was<00:02:24.640> saying<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:25.060> he<00:02:25.569> wants<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
career was saying that he wants to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100 
career was saying that he wants to
retire<00:02:26.200> bile<00:02:26.470> at<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.770> age<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.810> 27<00:02:28.810> or

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
retire bile at the age of 27 or

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.360 
retire bile at the age of 27 or
something<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.590> 28<00:02:30.190> 27<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.739> he's<00:02:32.739> around

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
something like that 28 27 so he's around

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.089 
something like that 28 27 so he's around
our<00:02:33.580> age<00:02:33.700> now<00:02:34.000> i<00:02:34.030> believe<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
our age now i believe so this is the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.580 
our age now i believe so this is the
time<00:02:36.310> when<00:02:36.489> he<00:02:36.640> wanted<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.090> retire<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.380> maybe

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
time when he wanted to retire so maybe

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.589 
time when he wanted to retire so maybe
he's<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.040> looking<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.730> fight<00:02:40.000> against

he's just looking for that fight against
one<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.530> those<00:02:41.680> big<00:02:41.890> names<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.660> once<00:02:43.660> he<00:02:43.840> has

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.870
