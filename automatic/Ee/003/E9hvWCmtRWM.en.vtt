same<00:00:43.500> mentality<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> game<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.120> do

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
same mentality with this game as I do

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
same mentality with this game as I do
with<00:00:45.390> call<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> duty<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.320> red<00:00:46.530> dot<00:00:46.739> sight

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
with call of duty the red dot sight

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.260 
with call of duty the red dot sight
seemed<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.550> better<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> assault

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
seemed to be better with the assault

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670 
seemed to be better with the assault
rifles<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> seems<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.530> more

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
rifles it seems to be a little bit more

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.049 
rifles it seems to be a little bit more
precise<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> using

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
precise when it comes down to using

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
precise when it comes down to using
distance<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> holographic<00:00:52.320> seems<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> be

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
distance and the holographic seems to be

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
distance and the holographic seems to be
what<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> need<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.820> mia<00:00:54.270> close<00:00:54.780> range<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
what you need in mia close range to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
what you need in mia close range to
medium<00:00:55.559> range<00:00:55.739> combat<00:00:55.949> situations<00:00:56.610> whereas<00:00:57.180> i

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
medium range combat situations whereas i

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
medium range combat situations whereas i
think<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> red<00:00:57.840> dot<00:00:58.020> sight<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.559> for

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
think the red dot sight is better for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
think the red dot sight is better for
medium<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> long<00:00:59.370> range<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.149> m416<00:01:00.750> from

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
medium to long range in the m416 from

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
medium to long range in the m416 from
the<00:01:01.230> guns<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.649> experienced<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.340> far

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the guns that I've experienced so far

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
the guns that I've experienced so far
from<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> guns<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.750> noticed<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.260> far

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
from the guns that I have noticed so far

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
from the guns that I have noticed so far
is<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.700> best<00:01:05.939> medium<00:01:06.479> long<00:01:06.689> range<00:01:06.930> gun<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is the best medium long range gun that I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.109 
is the best medium long range gun that I
have<00:01:07.530> found<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.250> best<00:01:08.280> part<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
have found the best part about it is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
have found the best part about it is
it's<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> first<00:01:10.320> unlock<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's I think the first unlock it's the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's I think the first unlock it's the
first<00:01:11.850> unlock<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> assault<00:01:12.630> class<00:01:12.869> pretty

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
first unlock in the assault class pretty

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950 
first unlock in the assault class pretty
damn<00:01:13.920> close<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> takes<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.180> little

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
damn close but it takes a very little

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
damn close but it takes a very little
bit<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> bullets<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> kill<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.830> guy<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.250> not

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
breaching the first area of that map in

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500 
breaching the first area of that map in
the<00:02:49.470> subway<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.670> need<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.120> use<00:02:51.330> something

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the subway you need to use something

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.660 
the subway you need to use something
like<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.900> m416<00:02:52.440> where<00:02:52.769> range<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> little

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
like the m416 where range is a little

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.940 
like the m416 where range is a little
bit<00:02:53.819> more<00:02:54.030> useful<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.079> that's<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
bit more useful and that's just what I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.350 
bit more useful and that's just what I
think<00:02:56.250> about<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.700> gun<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:56.940> one<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.269> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
think about it this gun is one of the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.940 
think about it this gun is one of the
best<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.750> there<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.079> could<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:58.769> here

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
best out there you could I come up here

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.710 
best out there you could I come up here
I<00:02:59.130> pick<00:02:59.579> up<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.760> few<00:02:59.880> kills<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.329> close<00:03:00.569> range

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
I pick up a few kills in close range

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.900 
I pick up a few kills in close range
situation<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.130> wasted<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.579> lot<00:03:02.610> more

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
situation I would have wasted a lot more

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.270 
situation I would have wasted a lot more
ammo<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.569> seeing<00:03:03.780> as<00:03:03.840> how<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> UOP<00:03:04.590> 45<00:03:05.069> has<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
ammo and seeing as how the UOP 45 has a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940 
ammo and seeing as how the UOP 45 has a
few<00:03:05.640> fewer<00:03:06.239> less<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.690> bullets<00:03:07.019> available<00:03:07.769> for

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
few fewer less of bullets available for

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.770 
few fewer less of bullets available for
you<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.579> guy<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.940> was<00:03:09.030> running<00:03:09.060> away<00:03:09.510> was

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
you that guy that was running away was

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.780 
you that guy that was running away was
considerably<00:03:10.440> around<00:03:10.829> medium<00:03:11.280> range<00:03:11.519> shot

considerably around medium range shot

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.270 
considerably around medium range shot
and<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> made<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.170> guy<00:03:13.349> dancing<00:03:13.920> that's<00:03:14.069> nicer

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it he's got two left feet though so it's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.250
