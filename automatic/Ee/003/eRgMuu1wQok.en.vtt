near<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.530> sound<00:00:43.830> quality<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.940> extent

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
near the sound quality with an extent

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.350 
near the sound quality with an extent
like<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.840> without<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.490> don't<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.820> why

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
you want to use the external mic in my
opinion<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.690> doesn't<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:53.250> anything

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
opinion it really doesn't do anything

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.260 
opinion it really doesn't do anything
for<00:00:53.580> me<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:54.450> wearing<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.960> strapped<00:00:55.560> on<00:00:55.800> and

for me you're wearing it strapped on and
you<00:00:57.270> can't<00:00:57.540> really<00:00:57.750> plug<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.440> external

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
microphone into it and with the a s 30

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.390 
microphone into it and with the a s 30
it<00:01:01.890> can't<00:01:02.190> sit<00:01:02.670> without<00:01:03.660> being<00:01:04.259> like<00:01:04.890> inside

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it can't sit without being like inside

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.830 
it can't sit without being like inside
the<00:01:05.549> case<00:01:05.759> I<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> propped<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the case I kind of propped it up a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.020 
the case I kind of propped it up a
little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.079> how<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.259> put<00:01:07.500> stuff<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.860> between

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
little bit how to put stuff in between

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.819 
little bit how to put stuff in between

so this is a sound quality with me about

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.580 
so this is a sound quality with me about
two<00:01:11.220> feet<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.850> camera<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.320> minute

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
two feet from the camera so in a minute

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649 
two feet from the camera so in a minute
I'm<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> plug<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> external<00:01:15.270> mic<00:01:15.420> in

and plug the mic into it this is one of

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.309 
and plug the mic into it this is one of
the<00:02:23.520> reasons<00:02:23.880> why<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.110> cool

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
the reasons why I think this is a cool

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.710 
the reasons why I think this is a cool
feature<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.180> really<00:02:27.180> how<00:02:27.300> much<00:02:27.450> you're<00:02:27.599> going

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
feature but really how much you're going

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.420 
feature but really how much you're going
to<00:02:27.780> use<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.800> mounts<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.160> seen

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to use it and all the mounts have seen

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.030 
to use it and all the mounts have seen
doesn't<00:02:30.300> give<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.660> way<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
doesn't give you a way to put the

doesn't give you a way to put the
external<00:02:32.400> microphone<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:34.709> far<00:02:35.099> as

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
external microphone into it as far as

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.190 
external microphone into it as far as
the<00:02:35.310> cases<00:02:35.940> go<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.739> my<00:02:37.920> skeleton

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the cases go this is my skeleton

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
the cases go this is my skeleton
trapdoor<00:02:40.200> case<00:02:40.709> four<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:42.450> has<00:02:42.569> no<00:02:42.840> spot<00:02:43.140> to

trapdoor case four and it has no spot to
put<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> into<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> know<00:02:44.220> I've<00:02:44.459> seen<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.700> lot<00:02:44.880> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
put it into I know I've seen a lot of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.809 
put it into I know I've seen a lot of
people<00:02:45.860> customize<00:02:46.860> their<00:02:47.040> own<00:02:47.069> cases<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
people customize their own cases I

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.610 
people customize their own cases I
obviously<00:02:48.599> wouldn't<00:02:48.959> do<00:02:49.140> something<00:02:49.500> like

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
obviously wouldn't do something like

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.120 
obviously wouldn't do something like
that<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.480> thinking<00:02:51.480> about<00:02:51.650> why<00:02:52.650> you'd<00:02:52.830> want

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
that and thinking about why you'd want

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.309 
that and thinking about why you'd want
to<00:02:53.190> use<00:02:53.250> an<00:02:54.030> external<00:02:54.390> microphone<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.200> see

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
to use an external microphone I can see

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.390 
to use an external microphone I can see
maybe<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.769> were<00:02:55.890> like<00:02:56.100> on<00:02:56.250> your

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
maybe if you were like on your

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.970 
maybe if you were like on your
motorcycle<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.360> wanted<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.660> talk<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.799> say

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
motorcycle and you wanted to talk or say

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.990

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
you're doing something crazy and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.640 
somebody want to hear you screaming
rather<00:03:02.370> than<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.880> sound<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.390> wind<00:03:03.650> those

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
rather than the sound of the wind those

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.900 
rather than the sound of the wind those
