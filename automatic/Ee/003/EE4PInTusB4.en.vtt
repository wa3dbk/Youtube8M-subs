00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
out the turtles that I was talking about

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.750 
out the turtles that I was talking about
and<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.409> bunch<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> people

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and as you can see a bunch of people

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
and as you can see a bunch of people
snorkeling<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.100> probably<00:01:17.100> swimming<00:01:17.340> with

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
snorkeling and probably swimming with

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
snorkeling and probably swimming with
the<00:01:17.610> turtles<00:01:17.939> when<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> spot<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.350> move

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the turtles when you spot them they move

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
the turtles when you spot them they move
pretty<00:01:19.680> quickly<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
pretty quickly so you really have to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
pretty quickly so you really have to
stay<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.299> top<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.950> not

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
stay on top of them and you're not

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
stay on top of them and you're not
allowed<00:01:23.250> touching<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.000> hanging<00:01:24.180> on

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
allowed touching them so no hanging on

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.350 
allowed touching them so no hanging on
to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.000
