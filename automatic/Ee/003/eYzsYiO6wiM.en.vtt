like<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.400> these<00:04:30.849> two<00:04:31.150> children<00:04:31.539> in<00:04:31.629> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
like this these two children in the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.779 
like this these two children in the
shadows<00:04:32.050> Theo's<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.979> slice<00:04:33.220> him<00:04:33.490> up<00:04:33.580> and

shadows Theo's just slice him up and
whatnot<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:35.800> something<00:04:35.979> i<00:04:36.099> guess

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
whatnot and that's something i guess

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.830 
whatnot and that's something i guess
because<00:04:36.340> i<00:04:36.520> have<00:04:36.729> read<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.090> first<00:04:37.330> volume<00:04:37.539> of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
because i have read the first volume of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.680 
because i have read the first volume of
this<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:38.259> and<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:39.069> I<00:04:39.400> love<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.210> pacing<00:04:40.599> and

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
this right and so I love the pacing and

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.540 
this right and so I love the pacing and
how<00:04:40.960> they<00:04:41.199> adapted<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:41.740> episode<00:04:42.099> but<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.310> will

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
how they adapted this episode but I will

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.100 
how they adapted this episode but I will

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
have a problem with it because they skip

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.499 
have a problem with it because they skip
chapter<00:04:44.530> 2<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> they<00:04:45.400> adapted<00:04:45.849> chapters<00:04:46.270> 3

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
now and I like I honestly like and this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.540 
now and I like I honestly like and this
is<00:04:56.110> kind<00:04:56.319> of<00:04:56.470> spoiler<00:04:56.710> territory<00:04:56.889> but<00:04:57.400> not

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
is kind of spoiler territory but not

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.559 
is kind of spoiler territory but not
really<00:04:57.699> because<00:04:57.819> I'm<00:04:57.970> not<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.300> spoil<00:04:58.509> i

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
really because I'm not going to spoil i

00:04:58.569 --> 00:04:59.760 
really because I'm not going to spoil i
think<00:04:58.720> i'm<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.050> be<00:04:59.409> talking<00:04:59.590> about

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
think i'm just going to be talking about

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.350 
think i'm just going to be talking about
chapter<00:05:00.009> 2<00:05:00.250> what<00:05:00.370> we<00:05:00.520> didn't<00:05:00.759> cover<00:05:00.880> but<00:05:01.180> i

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
chapter 2 what we didn't cover but i

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.770 
chapter 2 what we didn't cover but i
like<00:05:01.900> how<00:05:02.289> they<00:05:03.009> didn't<00:05:03.490> go<00:05:03.729> into<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.539> whole

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
like how they didn't go into the whole

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.260 
like how they didn't go into the whole
setup<00:05:05.139> with<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.949> know<00:05:06.069> Warrick<00:05:06.789> and<00:05:06.909> Nicola

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
setup with you know Warrick and Nicola

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.059 
setup with you know Warrick and Nicola
and<00:05:07.630> trying<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.080> hint<00:05:08.259> at<00:05:08.380> their<00:05:08.560> backstory

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
and trying to hint at their backstory

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.740 
and trying to hint at their backstory
and<00:05:09.220> their<00:05:09.669> how<00:05:10.150> they<00:05:10.300> met<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.569> everything

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
and their how they met and everything

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.809 
and their how they met and everything
like<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.229> in<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.650> past<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.159> how<00:05:12.520> they<00:05:12.669> went

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
like that in the past and how they went

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.129 
like that in the past and how they went
to<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.150> chapter<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.509> kind<00:05:13.780> of<00:05:13.810> like<00:05:13.990> that

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
to that chapter I kind of like that

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.809 
to that chapter I kind of like that
because<00:05:14.259> that<00:05:14.620> serves<00:05:15.340> better<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:15.669> they<00:05:15.759> do

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
because that serves better if they do

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.760 
because that serves better if they do
that<00:05:16.030> like<00:05:16.180> next<00:05:16.539> episode<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.169> we<00:05:17.199> better

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
that like next episode and we better

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.140 
that like next episode and we better
with<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.099> set<00:05:18.250> up<00:05:18.370> with<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.580> twilights<00:05:19.000> and

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
with the set up with the twilights and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.820 
with the set up with the twilights and
the<00:05:19.210> tags<00:05:19.449> already<00:05:19.810> out<00:05:20.139> of<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.289> way<00:05:20.469> I<00:05:20.500> like

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
the tags already out of the way I like

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.010 
the tags already out of the way I like
how<00:05:21.009> they<00:05:21.190> they<00:05:21.610> decide<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.000> opt<00:05:22.150> rep<00:05:22.539> chapters

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
how they they decide to opt rep chapters

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.140 
how they they decide to opt rep chapters
three<00:05:23.229> and<00:05:23.259> four<00:05:23.590> and<00:05:23.740> speed<00:05:24.460> up<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.669> pacing<00:05:25.090> a

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
three and four and speed up the pacing a

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.309 
three and four and speed up the pacing a
little<00:05:25.360> bit<00:05:25.479> but<00:05:25.539> if<00:05:25.659> they<00:05:25.780> just<00:05:26.020> completely

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
little bit but if they just completely

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.439 
little bit but if they just completely
skip<00:05:26.740> over<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:27.130> fact<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:27.430> works<00:05:27.759> a<00:05:27.969> gigolo

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
skip over the fact that works a gigolo

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.689 
skip over the fact that works a gigolo
that<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.409> know<00:05:29.590> what<00:05:29.979> happened<00:05:30.370> in<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.520> past

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
that you know what happened in the past

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.520 
that you know what happened in the past

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
and how he had to end up in a rational

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.379 
and how he had to end up in a rational
man<00:05:32.800> everything<00:05:33.099> hinting<00:05:33.400> at<00:05:33.490> his<00:05:33.669> his<00:05:34.060> past

man everything hinting at his his past
with<00:05:34.599> Nicola<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:34.990> everything<00:05:35.319> like<00:05:35.409> that<00:05:35.469> if

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
with Nicola and everything like that if
