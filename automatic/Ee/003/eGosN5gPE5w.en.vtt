residue around the top of the jars

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.040 
residue around the top of the jars
because<00:04:00.330> we're<00:04:00.450> getting<00:04:00.540> ready<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.810> put<00:04:00.990> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
slopped around on it like this jar just

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.810 
slopped around on it like this jar just
need<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.770> make<00:04:13.890> sure<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.370> clean<00:04:14.610> this

need to make sure that you clean this
lid<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.340> will<00:04:17.580> seal<00:04:17.940> our<00:04:19.580> next<00:04:20.580> step<00:04:21.019> is

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
lid so it will seal our next step is

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.060 
lid so it will seal our next step is
you're<00:04:22.140> going<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.320> take<00:04:22.470> some<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> lids
