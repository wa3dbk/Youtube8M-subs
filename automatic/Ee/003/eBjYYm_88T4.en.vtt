00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.800
 to highlight part of the web material 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.059
 use extra kink 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.059
 kinking 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.949
 kink always goes away from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 inflection points and to the point 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.220
 endings i mean he can go like 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.869
 hour after counterclockwise 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.470
 for example for creating kinks one by one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.980
 to the side 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.339
 you need to enter the following data vertex 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.350
 one start kinking top 2 end 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.290
 inflection level one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.430
 width 1 kinks in centimeters second 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.320
 level width 2 kinks in centimeters 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.839
 distance from will allow to start bending not 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.790
 from the very edge of the back side some 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.320
 the distance 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.659
 to create kinks with great 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.629
 number of levels you can add 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.580
 kinks over previously created data 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 from the example will lead to the creation of such 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 bend limit on the number of points 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.009
 no bend can cover only one 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.009
 side and all the shape around the perimeter 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.979
 you can also create multiple 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.979
 kinks 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 the program allows you to calculate the coordinates 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 points of the figure for cutting stretch 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.659
 ceiling 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.259
 To do this, click the dialog button 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.900
 cutting 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.020
 you need to specify the side or the top by 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.030
 which show will go then choose 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.190
 material group and the material itself from 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 whose ceiling will be cut for 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.960
 each material has values 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 tension coefficient value 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 coefficient can be any on your 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 discretion width of material in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.399
 centimeters is also given for any 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.159
 of the material 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.280
 but you can change it, and hand it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.220
 dialogue, you can also set the direction 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.119
 the seam according to the indentation from their side 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.770
 diagonally or even perpendicular name 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.319
 if walked perpendicular to the side 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.989
 either diagonally you can select centers 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.060
 so you can choose either that he will 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.880
 pass through one of the vertices either by 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.569
 center then you need to press the button 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.370
 ok and the cut result will be on screen in 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.250
 any moment you can call the body again 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.200
 paint and set other shape parameters 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 turns so that the seam is all 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 ryazan tall linen design clearly 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.250
 around the figure in order to avoid unnecessary 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.840
 spending material when the program 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.930
 is in dealer mode 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.790
 dealers work only in this mode too 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.019
 I hide it is displayed just lines 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
 seam directions 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.970
 highlighted in green print forms with 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.970
 cutting is also not available
