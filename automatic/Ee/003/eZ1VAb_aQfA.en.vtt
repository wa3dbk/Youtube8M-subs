00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to do is race against the clock to see

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
to do is race against the clock to see
the<00:01:14.670> Sun<00:01:14.880> come<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.659> soon<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
basically you have to get as fast as you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.020 
basically you have to get as fast as you
can<00:01:19.829> and<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.130> far<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.399> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.789> from<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
nighttime so here we go so basically

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.940 
nighttime so here we go so basically
here<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.729> open<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.689> wings<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.740> just

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
here when you open your wings you just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
here when you open your wings you just
let<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> button<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.210> touch

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
let go of the button and then you touch

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
let go of the button and then you touch
you<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> tighten<00:01:32.039> up<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.399> drop<00:01:32.700> real

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you kind of tighten up and drop real

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
you kind of tighten up and drop real
quick<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.609> started

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
quick so as you can see I just started

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:46.350 
quick so as you can see I just started
getting<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> little<00:01:36.270> air<00:01:39.439> drop<00:01:40.439> take<00:01:40.979> off

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.090 

take<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.539> few<00:01:47.780> tries<00:01:48.079> just<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.619> figure<00:01:48.979> out

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
take the few tries just to figure out

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.719 
take the few tries just to figure out
how<00:01:49.399> exactly<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:51.500> can<00:01:51.710> really<00:01:52.009> start<00:01:52.219> taking

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
how exactly you can really start taking

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
how exactly you can really start taking
off<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.119> get<00:01:53.240> an<00:01:53.329> air<00:01:53.539> time

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.760 

so<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> Sun<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.420> slowly<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.710> I'm

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
so the Sun is slowly going down and I'm

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.370 
so the Sun is slowly going down and I'm
trying<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> race<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.539> sky<00:02:06.869> from<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
trying to race the the sky from the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.650 
trying to race the the sky from the
coming<00:02:07.710> night<00:02:10.640> we've<00:02:11.640> got<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.970> big<00:02:12.300> jump

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
coming night we've got this big jump

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.750 
coming night we've got this big jump
right<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.780 

so<00:02:18.569> when<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.379> cross<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.890> little<00:02:20.190> area<00:02:20.459> it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so when you cross this little area it's

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.850 
so when you cross this little area it's
a<00:02:20.879> different<00:02:21.239> island<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:22.379> have<00:02:22.530> checkpoints

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
a different island you have checkpoints

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
a different island you have checkpoints
you<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> fourth<00:02:24.420> island<00:02:24.930> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
you have to get to the fourth island to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.289 
you have to get to the fourth island to
kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.379> beat<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> level

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
kind of beat the level

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.300 
kind of beat the level
so<00:02:27.299> there's<00:02:27.690> small<00:02:28.110> objectives<00:02:28.799> as<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> stuff

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
so there's small objectives as the stuff

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
so there's small objectives as the stuff
doesn't<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.120> forever<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.659> ever

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
doesn't go on forever and ever

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.690 
doesn't go on forever and ever
you<00:02:31.049> got<00:02:31.230> me<00:02:31.590> seagull<00:02:32.099> sounds<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you got me seagull sounds in the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.640 
you got me seagull sounds in the
background<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:33.900> crow<00:02:34.170> sounds

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
background and then they got crow sounds

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.680 
background and then they got crow sounds
right<00:02:34.830> after<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.459> little<00:02:36.330> weird

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
right after a little weird

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.660 
right after a little weird
we're<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.410> birds<00:02:37.980> from<00:02:38.250> different

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
we're in birds from different

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.900 
we're in birds from different
environments<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.750> same<00:02:40.879> type<00:02:41.879> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
environments all on the same type of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.270 
environments all on the same type of
thing<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.440> got<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:46.890> know

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
when to sit to drop down so you try to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.200 
when to sit to drop down so you try to
hit<00:02:49.709> use<00:02:49.860> max<00:02:50.129> slopes<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.849> take<00:02:51.030> off

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210
