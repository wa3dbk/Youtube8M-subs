Dennis said this is the 12 year
expression<00:00:37.520> yes<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.739> 86<00:00:40.739> proof

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
expression yes so this is a 86 proof

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
expression yes so this is a 86 proof
take<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> look<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.600> color<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.680> that's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
take a look at that color and that's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.729 
take a look at that color and that's
more<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> lighter<00:00:45.210> side<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
more on the lighter side do you have for

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.170 
more on the lighter side do you have for
probably<00:00:47.280> gonna<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> honey

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
probably gonna be like the honey

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.260 
probably gonna be like the honey
yeah<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:49.530> say<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:50.010> he's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> corporate<00:00:51.059> color

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
yeah I'd say no he's a corporate color

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.439 
yeah I'd say no he's a corporate color
sure<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.320> take<00:00:52.620> another<00:00:52.739> shower

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.569 

so<00:01:01.019> first<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.469> noticing<00:01:01.500> Jeff<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> some

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so first thing I'm noticing Jeff is some

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.320 
so first thing I'm noticing Jeff is some
of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.929> alcohol<00:01:03.929> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> nose<00:01:05.330> yes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
of the alcohol on the nose yes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
of the alcohol on the nose yes
definitely<00:01:06.930> okay<00:01:07.259> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> twelve-year

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
definitely okay I think the twelve-year

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
definitely okay I think the twelve-year
ready<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.119> definitely<00:01:09.840> coming<00:01:09.960> through

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
ready just is definitely coming through

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.550 
ready just is definitely coming through
there<00:01:11.060> I'm<00:01:12.060> gonna<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.930> limb<00:01:13.020> assume

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
there I'm gonna go out on a limb assume

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.240 
there I'm gonna go out on a limb assume
this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.340> 12<00:01:14.610> year<00:01:14.970> light<00:01:15.720> label

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
this is probably a 12 year light label

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.350 
this is probably a 12 year light label
probably<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.520> something<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
probably something something like that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
probably something something like that
so<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.840> definitely<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:19.799> oaky<00:01:20.369> than

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so it's definitely much more oaky than

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
so it's definitely much more oaky than
you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:22.409> typical<00:01:22.619> Jim<00:01:23.009> Beam<00:01:23.189> product

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
yeah that's certainly the first known

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.179 
yeah that's certainly the first known
idea<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.430> well<00:01:27.110> some<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> Jim<00:01:28.530> Beam<00:01:28.740> meats

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
they on the taste that I did in the nose

oak<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.310> said<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.090> still<00:02:29.750> very<00:02:30.350> much<00:02:30.530> shaping

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
oak you said is still very much shaping

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.750 
oak you said is still very much shaping
the<00:02:31.250> flavor<00:02:31.520> palate<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:33.640> flavors<00:02:34.640> are

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the flavor palate here flavors are

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.270 
the flavor palate here flavors are
pretty<00:02:35.000> light<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.750> know<00:02:35.870> yeah<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.800> is<00:02:36.980> light

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
pretty light you know yeah it is light

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.850 
pretty light you know yeah it is light
again<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.630> before<00:02:38.720> those<00:02:38.990> not<00:02:39.320> non

bold<00:02:40.390> flavors<00:02:41.390> jumping<00:02:41.750> out<00:02:41.840> at<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.230> which

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
bold flavors jumping out at you which

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.930 
bold flavors jumping out at you which
for<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> twelve-year<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.490> would<00:02:43.610> think<00:02:43.730> there

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
for a twelve-year you would think there

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.420 
for a twelve-year you would think there
probably<00:02:43.970> would<00:02:44.510> be<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:45.740> know<00:02:45.860> some<00:02:46.130> some

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
probably would be you know some some

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.890 
probably would be you know some some
more<00:02:46.730> flavor<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:49.330> boldness<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.750> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
more flavor to it more boldness with it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.480 
more flavor to it more boldness with it
and<00:02:51.140> there's<00:02:51.290> with<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.560> sliding<00:02:51.800> scale<00:02:52.190> you

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
and there's with that sliding scale you

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.760 
and there's with that sliding scale you
know<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.820> age<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.900> then<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.140> proof<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.680> know

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
know the age and then the proof you know

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.910 
know the age and then the proof you know
such<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.640> higher<00:02:55.820> age<00:02:56.530> such<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> little

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
such a it's a higher age such a little

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.130 
such a it's a higher age such a little
proof<00:02:58.209> would<00:02:59.209> love<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.510> see<00:02:59.660> those<00:02:59.780> they<00:02:59.959> make

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
proof would love to see those they make

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.140 
proof would love to see those they make
it<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.410> hundred<00:03:00.770> proof<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.430> yeah<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
it like a hundred proof you know yeah I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.900 
it like a hundred proof you know yeah I
think<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.720> think<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.440> higher<00:03:03.920> proof<00:03:04.310> would<00:03:04.520> be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
think I think a higher proof would be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.300 
think I think a higher proof would be
more<00:03:05.360> advantageous<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:09.950> baking

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
more advantageous to this so that baking

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.880 
more advantageous to this so that baking
spicy<00:03:10.760> no<00:03:11.030> time<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.450> her<00:03:11.540> fingers<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.050> done

that caramels still there I'm getting a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.150 
that caramels still there I'm getting a
little<00:03:20.930> bit<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.260> hint<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.620> some<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.040> know

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
little bit of a hint of some you know

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.220 
little bit of a hint of some you know
some<00:03:22.310> dark<00:03:22.580> fruit<00:03:22.910> maybe<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.330> cherry<00:03:23.900> or

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
some dark fruit maybe like a cherry or

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.479 
some dark fruit maybe like a cherry or
something<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.980> definitely<00:03:25.160> agree

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
something like that I definitely agree

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.949 
something like that I definitely agree
with<00:03:25.610> cherry<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.269> dark<00:03:26.510> fruits<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:28.780> little<00:03:29.780> bit

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
with cherry at dark fruits a little bit

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.160 
with cherry at dark fruits a little bit
of<00:03:30.080> alcohol<00:03:30.230> on<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:32.540> know<00:03:32.630> on<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> palate

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
of alcohol on the you know on the palate

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.460 
of alcohol on the you know on the palate
as<00:03:33.290> well<00:03:34.239> once<00:03:35.239> your<00:03:35.390> water<00:03:35.480> down<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.959> ensure

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
as well once your water down you ensure

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.170 
as well once your water down you ensure
I<00:03:36.500> smell<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.860> little<00:03:36.950> bit<00:03:37.070> more<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.549> diminishes

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
I smell a little bit more it diminishes

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.580 
I smell a little bit more it diminishes
but<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> think<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.930> know<00:03:39.019> initially<00:03:39.200> there<00:03:39.530> was

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
but I think you know initially there was

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.430 
but I think you know initially there was
a<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:39.890> bit<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.900> little<00:03:41.900> bit<00:03:41.989> alcohol

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
a little bit of a little bit alcohol

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.009 
a little bit of a little bit alcohol
with<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.739> as<00:03:42.860> well<00:03:43.209> yeah<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.239> mean<00:03:44.390> an

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.690 
with that as well yeah I mean an
interesting<00:03:45.500> expression<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.489> know<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.610> know

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
interesting expression you know I know

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300 
interesting expression you know I know
we've<00:03:47.090> had<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.810> white<00:03:48.200> label<00:03:48.440> we've<00:03:48.830> had<00:03:49.070> the

Jeff what would you of any final

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.870 
Jeff what would you of any final
thoughts<00:04:01.280> before<00:04:01.670> we<00:04:02.209> jump<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.570> reading<00:04:02.900> I

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
thoughts before we jump to the reading I

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.699 
thoughts before we jump to the reading I
mean<00:04:04.880> III<00:04:05.299> definitely<00:04:05.510> would<00:04:06.230> have<00:04:06.320> expected

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
mean III definitely would have expected

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.020 
mean III definitely would have expected
a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:06.799> bit<00:04:06.950> more<00:04:07.220> out<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.610> from<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.820> 12

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
a little bit more out of it from a 12

a little bit more out of it from a 12
