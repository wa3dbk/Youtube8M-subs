00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.260 

okay

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.990 

note<00:00:04.930> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.780 

Green<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.520> slightly<00:00:12.080> flickering<00:00:13.080> red

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.560 

when<00:00:17.390> it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
when it

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.029 
when it
when<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.289> left<00:00:20.980> wire<00:00:21.369> on<00:00:21.609> the<00:00:21.699> coil<00:00:23.039> connected

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
when the left wire on the coil connected

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.689 
when the left wire on the coil connected
is<00:00:24.279> probe<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:27.070> blinking<00:00:27.489> it's<00:00:27.939> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is probe it's a blinking it's a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.310 
is probe it's a blinking it's a
pulsating<00:00:30.449> red<00:00:31.130> with<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> green

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
pulsating red with a green

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:46.600 
pulsating red with a green
like<00:00:34.950> right

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.310 

this<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.390> how<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.690> supposed<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.200> look

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
this is how it supposed to look

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.150 
this is how it supposed to look
pulsating<00:00:51.070> green<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.930> no<00:00:53.200> red

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.580 

that's<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.910> way<00:00:58.030> it's<00:00:58.150> supposed<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.540> look<00:00:58.630> the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
that's the way it's supposed to look the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:12.960 
that's the way it's supposed to look the
proper<00:01:00.100> operating<00:01:00.960> coil<00:01:01.960> connector

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:23.139 

as<00:01:13.510> you<00:01:13.660> can<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.230> red

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.899 

the<00:01:23.479> red<00:01:23.719> being<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.170> ground<00:01:24.590> not<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.729> red

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
the red being the ground not the red

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.349 
the red being the ground not the red
being<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.270> positive<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.670> green<00:01:29.030> being

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
being the positive and the green being

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.340 
being the positive and the green being
the<00:01:29.570> ground<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.750> red<00:01:32.960> being<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
the ground with the red being the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.940 
the ground with the red being the
positive<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.069> green<00:01:34.340> being<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.789> ground

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
positive and the green being the ground

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.370 
positive and the green being the ground
you'll<00:01:36.950> see<00:01:37.219> that<00:01:37.399> in<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.819> problem<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.630> one

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
you'll see that in the problem the one

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.370 
you'll see that in the problem the one
with<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.619> problem<00:01:40.039> circuit<00:01:40.929> it's<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:42.079> steady

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
with the problem circuit it's a steady

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.980 
with the problem circuit it's a steady
ground<00:01:43.030> with<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> pulsating

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.660 

right

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.630 

the<00:01:55.940> pulsating<00:01:56.660> positive<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.190> supposed

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the pulsating positive is not supposed

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.120 
the pulsating positive is not supposed
to<00:01:58.730> be<00:01:58.910> that<00:01:59.090> pulsating<00:01:59.690> positive

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.820 

supposed<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.220> be<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.460> pulsating<00:02:06.790> green<00:02:07.830> that's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
supposed to be a pulsating green that's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.490 
supposed to be a pulsating green that's
it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.700 

as<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.520> with<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.760> proper<00:02:14.150> point

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.640 

that<00:02:18.710> when<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.920> jiggle<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.430> wire<00:02:19.640> here

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that when you jiggle the wire here

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.010 
that when you jiggle the wire here
there's<00:02:21.650> no<00:02:21.890> change<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.550> engine<00:02:23.270> speed<00:02:23.570> that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
there's no change in engine speed that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.490 
there's no change in engine speed that
motor<00:02:24.320> engine<00:02:24.770> does<00:02:25.070> not<00:02:25.100> stall<00:02:25.580> out<00:02:26.500> do

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
motor engine does not stall out do

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.890 
motor engine does not stall out do
anything<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.950> want<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.400> wire<00:02:28.670> if<00:02:29.660> it's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
anything you want with this wire if it's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.820 
anything you want with this wire if it's
not<00:02:30.080> stall<00:02:30.380> out<00:02:30.820> okay
