00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.480
 at five thirty in the morning 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.970
 5 on average because Isabel was with 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.430
 very many everyone dress then and I'll go 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.470
 to her cradle reassured her of change 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.060
 could the pee friendship that he deserves 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.060
 because the truth is that it was like a 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.910
 little bit of fever then she stayed 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.369
 there and I went to the kitchen I put the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.519
 computer and you as you make a 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.339
 sketch of how to start throwing patterns 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.859
 you saw sad things, nothing, I think 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.480
 I'm ready to come out the truth 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.640
 because I had a lot of interest I'm going to 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.620
 repeat because I had a lot of desire to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.390
 go back to work I always said it when 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.460
 we were uploading the radio the other day 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.470
 it's really something that's a necessity 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.620
 because I feel that after what happened 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.020
 to jorge he lived a duel of very many 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.380
 tranquility and I feel that I lived it very 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.480
 intensely then today I need 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.460
 connect with life more than ever not 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.860
 you know what the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.660
 who swore that the last talk that I 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.540
 I was he told me I want to go back to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.009
 see in the musical that was marten that 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
 I got together we had on the pony line 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.460
 doctor I want to see you again in the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 musical and every monologues and that you 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.140
 you almost expect me to be alone as always 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.799
 then really for me it's like a 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.450
 thing I feel like a very special life 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.939
 in the body you understand why I could 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.459
 debut tomorrow because I know he 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.189
 I would be happy if he saw me through 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.170
 marcela tauro know that what this is 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.759
 very sensitive one of the things he said 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.579
 a little while ago he said maybe maybe that 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.060
 sensitivity that they felt in bot was 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.469
 also a factor for getting married 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 one of the things that we were here or 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.310
 analyzing I say I think it's a new 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.179
 forest stage from what 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.770
 happened with what happened to jorge ibáñez and 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.469
 I say it seems that maybe she 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 need or felt a message then 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.069
 that when I told you already I told you 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.110
 I promised and I'll fulfill it because before 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.329
 debut or after the debut I'll go 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.520
 I'm going to sit because we have a lot 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.289
 I have a lot of things to talk about 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.060
 tell you many things that were 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.750
 happening in life 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.870
 and I really believe that everyone 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.150
 something is this proposal to live in a 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.290
 moment 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 wonderful of my life that comes in a 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.590
 ideal moment comes to me in a moment of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.840
 much artistic desire then the truth 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.819
 what I say can not aesthetic the was that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.909
 another person is going to send me just ethical 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.430
 in something that I need with so much but 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.200

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.139

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.810
