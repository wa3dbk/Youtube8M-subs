00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.700
 Hello friends. We are in the bathroom today because I want to show you how to fix 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.900
 Toilet tank when no longer leakage of water. In addition, we will learn to open 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:24.199
 Tank with double stream. Others are very easy to open, they will screw, 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 But they have a double flow trick. Let's go for it. Good: The first thing we'll do 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.579
 Do is pry with a screwdriver in the buttons. First smaller 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.870
 Then bigger. Here we find a bolt that connects the lid, and empties 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.359
 And Medi. We raised a bit, and we removed the bezel. When lifting 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:56.410
 Above we find a piece that is loaded and which gives us problems. 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.239
 Rotate it as if it was a little theme, even "chatter." You can rip 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.020
 A little, but easy. The circular piece we see here is one with rubber. going to 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.690
 The plumbing workshop with complete piece to give you the specified rubber to be 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:28.970
 A change. Once you change the distance to put the dump truck, you can put yourselves cover. Put it down 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 Everything in the opposite order've done before. We again bezel, now tighten the screw and put the button. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.910
 I forgot to say that you have naturally closed water and check before 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:04.650
 Closing this may resolve the problem. As you can see it is very simple and does not cost too 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.900
 Time. There.
