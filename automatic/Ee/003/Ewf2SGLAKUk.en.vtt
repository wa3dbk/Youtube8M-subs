one of the most destructive things we

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.870 
one of the most destructive things we
can<00:02:07.840> do<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.050> ourselves<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.340> things<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:09.670> did<00:02:09.759> in

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
can do to ourselves the things we did in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.930 
can do to ourselves the things we did in
the<00:02:09.910> past<00:02:10.090> are<00:02:10.420> over<00:02:10.720> with<00:02:10.980> yeah<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.220> may<00:02:12.670> still

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the past are over with yeah it may still

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.569

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
we can't just wallow in the past

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.820 
we can't just wallow in the past
everything<00:02:18.270> will<00:02:18.390> sort<00:02:18.569> its<00:02:18.690> way<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.290> mean

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
everything will sort its way out I mean

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.330 
everything will sort its way out I mean
it<00:02:19.980> may<00:02:20.069> not<00:02:20.190> seem<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.540> will<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
slowly is for me but I know it will sort

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.300 
slowly is for me but I know it will sort
its<00:02:25.680> way<00:02:25.800> out<00:02:26.870> what<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.959> gotta<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.680> focus<00:02:29.040> on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310

on<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.069> things<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.519> could<00:02:32.640> do<00:02:32.730> different

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
on the things that we could do different

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.780 
on the things that we could do different
life<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.959> prevent<00:02:34.319> us<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:34.670> repeating<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
life to prevent us from repeating the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.540 
life to prevent us from repeating the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that we make adds to the complexity the

that we make adds to the complexity the
message<00:02:46.110> i<00:02:46.230> really<00:02:46.500> want<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> send<00:02:46.860> out<00:02:46.950> to
