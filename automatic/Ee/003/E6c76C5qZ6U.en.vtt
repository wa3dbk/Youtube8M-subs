00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.630
 this moment among the waters after the video 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.780
 where do you explain how to have a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.379
 cracked version I want to show this one 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.390
 who will teach you how to install a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.130
 emulator to play games by 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.260
 example game boy advance as I go 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.800
 close on a mac 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.150
 I specify 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.719
 I have a mac os x so you it's simple 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.700

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 so normally you have on home 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.129
 you go into an emulator and there he 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 is worth more beautiful to complain 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.930

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 I can not tell him I have a pc emulator this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.359
