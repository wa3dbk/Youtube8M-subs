third tip and trick is on air oh snap

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.260 
third tip and trick is on air oh snap
now<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:59.500> air<00:01:59.650> oh<00:01:59.680> snap<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.820> little<00:02:01.060> thing

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
now with air oh snap this little thing

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.870 
now with air oh snap this little thing
little<00:02:01.900> thing<00:02:02.560> they<00:02:02.680> have<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.490> allows

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
little thing they have here is allows

can<00:02:29.920> snap<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:30.520> side<00:02:30.730> window<00:02:31.000> by<00:02:31.120> doing

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
can snap the right side window by doing

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.809 
can snap the right side window by doing
the<00:02:31.420> same<00:02:31.690> exact<00:02:32.110> effect<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:33.280> go<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.580> snap

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
the same exact effect now go and snap

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.030 
the same exact effect now go and snap
that<00:02:34.090> done<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:34.870> now<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.050> can<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.680> work<00:02:35.800> my

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that done so now I can go in and work my

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.370 
that done so now I can go in and work my

word document as well as working on my
inner<00:02:39.280> explore<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.880> find<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.180> different<00:02:40.360> stuff

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
inner explore to find a different stuff

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.570 
inner explore to find a different stuff
or<00:02:40.900> research<00:02:41.350> or<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:42.100> know<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.370> case

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
or research or you know this case

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.729 
or research or you know this case
Arduino<00:02:43.090> board<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.440> nice<00:02:44.560> little

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
Arduino board so that's a nice little

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.080 
Arduino board so that's a nice little
thing<00:02:44.950> as<00:02:45.100> well<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.489> want<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.670> maximize

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
thing as well as but I want to maximize

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.370 
thing as well as but I want to maximize
things<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.840> bring<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> top

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
things I can go and bring it to the top

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.100 
things I can go and bring it to the top
and<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:48.069> maximized<00:02:48.670> I<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.630> crazy<00:02:49.900> but

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
and it's maximized I know it's crazy but

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.340 
and it's maximized I know it's crazy but
anyways<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.360> same<00:02:52.569> thing<00:02:52.600> also<00:02:52.900> actually

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
anyways so the same thing also actually

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.410 
anyways so the same thing also actually
happens<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.800> hotkeys<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:55.180> can<00:02:55.330> actually

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
happens with hotkeys you can actually

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.750 
happens with hotkeys you can actually
hold<00:02:55.720> down<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.019> windows<00:02:56.470> key<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.250> use<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
hold down the windows key and use the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.699 
hold down the windows key and use the
arrow<00:02:57.940> keys<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.269> do<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> same<00:02:58.780> effect<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.530> if<00:02:59.620> i

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
arrow keys to do the same effect so if i

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.259 
arrow keys to do the same effect so if i
wanted<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> maximize<00:03:00.160> window<00:03:00.819> i<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.120> actually

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
wanted to maximize window i can actually

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.699 
wanted to maximize window i can actually
hold<00:03:01.600> hold<00:03:01.989> down<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> windows<00:03:02.200> key<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.650> hit

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
hold hold down the windows key and hit

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.559 
hold hold down the windows key and hit
up<00:03:02.950> as<00:03:03.160> long<00:03:03.760> as<00:03:03.819> i<00:03:03.910> hit<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.060> arrow<00:03:04.209> key<00:03:04.420> up

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
up as long as i hit the arrow key up

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.030 
up as long as i hit the arrow key up
maximize<00:03:05.230> them<00:03:05.350> we<00:03:05.440> definitely<00:03:05.739> bring<00:03:05.950> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
maximize them we definitely bring it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
maximize them we definitely bring it
back<00:03:06.190> down<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.519> where<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.910> hit<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
back down to where this and hit the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.210 
back down to where this and hit the
arrow<00:03:07.209> key<00:03:07.390> down<00:03:07.569> once<00:03:07.840> if<00:03:08.080> i<00:03:08.620> want<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> snap<00:03:09.100> it

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
arrow key down once if i want to snap it

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.530 
arrow key down once if i want to snap it
to<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.400> left<00:03:09.519> hand<00:03:09.760> side<00:03:09.850> i<00:03:10.000> hit<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.299> left

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
to the left hand side i hit the left

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.570 
to the left hand side i hit the left
hand<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:11.319> left<00:03:11.560> an<00:03:11.799> arrow<00:03:11.980> key<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.370> then<00:03:12.489> if

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
hand up left an arrow key and then if

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.009 
hand up left an arrow key and then if
i'm<00:03:12.670> honest<00:03:12.940> after<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.299> do<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.600> right<00:03:13.810> hand

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
i'm honest after I do the right hand

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.630 
i'm honest after I do the right hand
arrow<00:03:14.170> key<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:15.100> brings<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> mail

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
arrow key and that brings in the mail

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.100 
arrow key and that brings in the mail
first<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:16.239> do<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.420> again<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.870> it's<00:03:17.019> on

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
first and then do it again and it's on

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.870 
first and then do it again and it's on
the<00:03:17.200> right<00:03:17.380> side<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.250> arrow<00:03:18.549> snaps

i've got this stuff right here so what i
can<00:03:58.060> do<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.299> i<00:03:58.630> can<00:03:58.780> actually<00:03:59.160> hover<00:04:00.160> over<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
can do is i can actually hover over the

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.400 
can do is i can actually hover over the
internet<00:04:01.000> explorer<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.510> actually<00:04:01.930> see<00:04:02.260> all

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
internet explorer and actually see all

the<00:04:02.500> windows<00:04:02.709> that<00:04:02.799> open<00:04:03.190> obviously<00:04:03.579> I've<00:04:03.670> got

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the windows that open obviously I've got

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.610 
the windows that open obviously I've got
a<00:04:03.850> bunch<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.090> Arduino<00:04:04.480> ones<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.530> then

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
a bunch of Arduino ones but I can then

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.349 
a bunch of Arduino ones but I can then
also<00:04:05.890> hover<00:04:06.280> over<00:04:06.609> and<00:04:06.760> actually<00:04:06.880> see<00:04:07.329> a

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
also hover over and actually see a

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.660 
also hover over and actually see a
preview<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:08.140> each<00:04:08.709> one<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:08.950> those<00:04:09.100> individual

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
preview of each one of those individual

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.550 
preview of each one of those individual
windows<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.299> nice<00:04:10.569> so<00:04:11.290> same<00:04:11.530> thing

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
windows which is nice so same thing
