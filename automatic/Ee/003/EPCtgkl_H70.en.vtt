00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 yes bloks his speech in support of the military 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.410
 John Kerry operations in particular built 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 to build fear 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 it was a lot like scary to many 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.289
 speech of the bush administration before the start 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.619
 invasion of iraq and if congress 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.170
 vote against the military operation 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.320
 confrontation in the future is inevitable with 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 Assad whether in Syria with nuclear weapons in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 iran or nuclear weapons of north korea 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.320
 and the choice that you have to make 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.430
 the world will be even more difficult to guide 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.379
 Secretary of State Kerry also talked about 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 mitigating circumstances of the military 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.270
 action against Syria to the question not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 will the US air forces betray by force 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590
 to extremists john kerry replied 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 negative he said extremists in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.730
 Syria will not benefit from hitting the USA though 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.309
 many experts argue the opposite 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.859
 also the state secretary said that otherwise 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.110
 there is no choice but to bomb Syria here 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 how he explains the willingness of the usa to attack 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.500
 in Syria bypassing the UN Security Council and in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.500
 violation of international law 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 he condemns the chemical attack without pointing 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 on the guilty not referring to the Assad not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 call responsible just condemns 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 chemical attack and Russia blocked 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 resolution is one of many 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 the contradictions of the performance of kerry at the very 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.470
 In fact, Russia blocked only those 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 resolutions which without any 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.009
 authoritative investigation he 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 attributed guilt exclusively 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.000
 Assad government john kerry not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 mentioned that the us did everything possible 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 so that a group of UN inspectors does not have 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.020
 authority to determine who is behind 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 attacks in syria all we have is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
 US intelligence and some of their 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.170
 Allies United States states that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.880
 classified evidence on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.450
 the grounds that they take their 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 solutions 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.040
 the public will not be presented in order 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 In time, many members of Congress even 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.149
 those who have not seen this evidence already 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.810
 have declared their willingness to allow 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.810
 attacks on syria
