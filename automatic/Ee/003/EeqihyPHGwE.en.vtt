00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
hello my name is Ning cam and this is

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.250 
hello my name is Ning cam and this is
the<00:00:08.889> third<00:00:09.160> in<00:00:09.430> a<00:00:09.520> series<00:00:09.549> of<00:00:09.879> short<00:00:10.330> tutorials

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
the third in a series of short tutorials

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.619 
the third in a series of short tutorials
on<00:00:11.500> violin<00:00:11.920> playing<00:00:12.160> in<00:00:12.369> general<00:00:12.789> I<00:00:13.000> thought

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
on violin playing in general I thought

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.240 
on violin playing in general I thought
we'd<00:00:13.750> talk<00:00:13.869> about<00:00:14.049> something<00:00:14.410> that<00:00:14.619> perhaps

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
we'd talk about something that perhaps

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.220 
we'd talk about something that perhaps
filin<00:00:15.969> teachers<00:00:16.330> don't<00:00:16.510> tend<00:00:16.720> to<00:00:16.779> spend<00:00:17.080> much

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
filin teachers don't tend to spend much

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.500 
filin teachers don't tend to spend much
time<00:00:17.260> on<00:00:17.650> in<00:00:17.830> lessons<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.640> that<00:00:18.910> is<00:00:19.060> pit

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
time on in lessons and that is pit

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.190 
time on in lessons and that is pit
ceccato

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
ceccato

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.010 
ceccato
now<00:00:21.010> if<00:00:21.100> you<00:00:21.250> are<00:00:21.400> a<00:00:21.430> harpist<00:00:21.880> pizza<00:00:22.630> counter

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
now if you are a harpist pizza counter

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.070 
now if you are a harpist pizza counter
would<00:00:23.200> be<00:00:23.940> very<00:00:24.940> very<00:00:25.360> important<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:25.990> you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
would be very very important to you

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.420 
would be very very important to you
because<00:00:26.170> that's<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.530> way<00:00:26.740> you<00:00:26.800> make<00:00:26.950> music

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
because that's the way you make music

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.450 
because that's the way you make music
that's<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.760> way<00:00:27.880> your<00:00:28.060> instrument<00:00:28.600> plays<00:00:28.780> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that's the way your instrument plays and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.590 
that's the way your instrument plays and
since<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.610> can<00:00:30.760> do<00:00:30.880> pizza<00:00:31.030> canto<00:00:31.420> on<00:00:31.539> the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
since we can do pizza canto on the

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.170 
since we can do pizza canto on the
violin<00:00:31.930> we<00:00:32.379> should<00:00:32.619> care<00:00:32.949> about<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.670> quality

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
violin we should care about the quality

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.660 
violin we should care about the quality
of<00:00:34.300> pizza<00:00:34.600> cutter<00:00:34.809> as<00:00:35.110> it's<00:00:35.560> just<00:00:36.370> as<00:00:36.489> much

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
of pizza cutter as it's just as much

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.060 
of pizza cutter as it's just as much
part<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.090> music<00:00:37.390> making<00:00:37.540> as<00:00:38.200> playing<00:00:38.739> anything

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
part of music making as playing anything

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.150 
part of music making as playing anything
with<00:00:39.160> your<00:00:39.250> bow<00:00:39.460> or<00:00:39.790> wrists<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.840> all<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:41.770> so

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
with your bow or wrists and all that so

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.930 
with your bow or wrists and all that so
let's<00:00:42.820> see<00:00:43.440> how<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:44.770> very<00:00:45.100> qualities<00:00:45.910> of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
let's see how it in very qualities of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.630 
let's see how it in very qualities of
pizza<00:00:46.329> cutter<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:47.350> quality<00:00:47.860> of<00:00:47.950> fit<00:00:48.100> ceccato

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
pizza cutter the quality of fit ceccato

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.090 
pizza cutter the quality of fit ceccato
is<00:00:48.820> determined<00:00:49.570> by<00:00:50.079> how<00:00:50.260> deep<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.739> go<00:00:50.890> into

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
is determined by how deep you go into

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.310 
is determined by how deep you go into
the<00:00:51.220> string<00:00:51.460> before<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.910> pit<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.510> how

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
the string before you pit and how

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.830 
the string before you pit and how
quickly<00:00:53.680> or<00:00:54.130> slowly<00:00:54.550> you<00:00:55.149> leave<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.540> string

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
quickly or slowly you leave the string

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.110 
quickly or slowly you leave the string
after<00:00:56.110> you've<00:00:56.680> pits<00:00:56.980> so<00:00:57.579> for<00:00:57.730> example

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
after you've pits so for example

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.420 
after you've pits so for example
something<00:00:58.329> that's<00:00:58.600> short<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.190> exciting<00:01:00.190> an

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
something that's short and exciting an

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.149 
something that's short and exciting an
accent<00:01:00.969> it<00:01:01.090> would<00:01:01.239> be<00:01:04.409> okay<00:01:05.409> see<00:01:05.469> how<00:01:05.649> fast<00:01:05.920> my

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
accent it would be okay see how fast my

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.249 
accent it would be okay see how fast my
hand<00:01:06.340> has<00:01:06.759> left<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.119> string<00:01:07.390> now<00:01:07.899> if<00:01:07.990> you<00:01:08.079> want

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
hand has left the string now if you want

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.300 
hand has left the string now if you want
something<00:01:08.439> that's<00:01:08.619> slower<00:01:09.749> perhaps<00:01:11.310> heavier

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
something that's slower perhaps heavier

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.929 
something that's slower perhaps heavier
more<00:01:13.060> melancholic<00:01:13.899> with<00:01:14.319> a<00:01:14.350> longer<00:01:14.850> sort<00:01:15.850> of

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
more melancholic with a longer sort of

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.199 
more melancholic with a longer sort of
resonance<00:01:16.799> put<00:01:17.799> your<00:01:17.950> finger<00:01:18.280> deeper<00:01:18.999> into

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
resonance put your finger deeper into

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:20.459 
resonance put your finger deeper into
the<00:01:19.299> string<00:01:19.539> which<00:01:19.719> means<00:01:19.959> getting<00:01:20.200> more

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
the string which means getting more

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.050 
the string which means getting more
behind<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.920> string<00:01:21.189> now<00:01:21.369> before<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.789> pits

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
behind the string now before you pits

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.120 
behind the string now before you pits
you<00:01:22.240> want<00:01:22.389> to<00:01:22.479> travel<00:01:22.990> down<00:01:23.139> the<00:01:23.289> string<00:01:23.590> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
you want to travel down the string and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.539 
you want to travel down the string and
then<00:01:24.789> release<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.270> slowly<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.950> speed<00:01:27.369> of

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
then release it slowly and the speed of

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.550 
then release it slowly and the speed of
your<00:01:27.700> hand<00:01:27.909> after<00:01:28.149> will<00:01:28.659> determine<00:01:29.139> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
your hand after will determine the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:42.310 
your hand after will determine the
quality<00:01:29.709> so<00:01:30.249> something<00:01:30.579> like<00:01:30.609> this

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.660 

now<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.710> how<00:01:43.829> slowly<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.250> move<00:01:44.490> my

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
now can you see how slowly I move my

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.179 
now can you see how slowly I move my
hand<00:01:44.909> after<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> pits<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.409> gives<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
hand after the pits it gives the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.969 
hand after the pits it gives the
listener<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:48.200> character<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> hang

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
listener a character that they can hang

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.910 
listener a character that they can hang
on<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.460> almost<00:01:50.609> sort<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.770> forces<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
on to it's almost sort of forces them to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.919 
on to it's almost sort of forces them to
listen<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.429> you<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:54.149> wonderful<00:01:54.719> because

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
listen to you that's wonderful because

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.770 
listen to you that's wonderful because
that's<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:56.039> music

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
that's what you want when you make music

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:15.050 
that's what you want when you make music
so<00:02:12.079> see<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.200> difference<00:02:13.730> think<00:02:14.730> about<00:02:14.940> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so see the difference think about it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.759 
so see the difference think about it
when<00:02:15.180> you're<00:02:15.299> practicing<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:16.500> fun

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
when you're practicing have fun

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.949 
when you're practicing have fun
experimenting<00:02:17.310> I'll<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.750> next
