what<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.569> aluminum<00:00:07.080> oxide<00:00:07.730> Luminox<00:00:08.730> oxide

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
what is the aluminum oxide Luminox oxide

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.749 
what is the aluminum oxide Luminox oxide
does<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> few<00:00:09.929> things<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.309> used<00:00:11.580> in

does a few things I can be used in

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
does a few things I can be used in
conjunction<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.420> HAARP<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.290> has<00:00:13.469> been

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
conjunction with HAARP and this has been

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.180 
conjunction with HAARP and this has been
disclosed<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.790> long<00:00:14.940> time<00:00:15.240> ago<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:16.190> HAARP

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
disclosed a long time ago that HAARP

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
disclosed a long time ago that HAARP
which<00:00:17.430> travels<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.119> electromagnetic

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
which travels with electromagnetic

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590 
which travels with electromagnetic
pulsations<00:00:19.770> through<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> atmosphere<00:00:20.760> can

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
pulsations through the atmosphere can

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.929 
pulsations through the atmosphere can
act<00:00:21.840> more<00:00:21.930> effectively<00:00:22.519> when<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.789> has

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
act more effectively when it has

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
act more effectively when it has
metallic<00:00:24.420> surfaces<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.260> other<00:00:25.380> words<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
metallic surfaces in other words it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
metallic surfaces in other words it
makes<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.920> more<00:00:26.039> conductive<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> air

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
makes it more conductive that the air

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.290 
makes it more conductive that the air
becomes<00:00:27.539> conductive<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> circuit<00:00:29.300> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
becomes conductive like a circuit and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110 
becomes conductive like a circuit and
again<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.289> your<00:00:31.500> target<00:00:31.800> has<00:00:32.309> happened<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> be

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
again if your target has happened to be

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
again if your target has happened to be
the<00:00:33.270> population<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> say<00:00:34.829> conductive

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the population when you say conductive

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
the population when you say conductive
are<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> talking<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.360> let<00:00:36.630> let's<00:00:37.290> say<00:00:37.500> if

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
are you talking about let let's say if

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.729 
are you talking about let let's say if
there's<00:00:37.920> an<00:00:38.100> electrical<00:00:38.640> storm<00:00:38.969> no<00:00:40.489> pulses<00:00:42.739> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
there's an electrical storm no pulses so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.160 
there's an electrical storm no pulses so
the<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.399> conductive<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.629> subject

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the more the more conductive the subject

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.150 
the more the more conductive the subject
is<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:47.059> either<00:00:48.059> inhaling<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.230> consuming<00:00:49.920> or

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is by either inhaling or consuming or

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
is by either inhaling or consuming or
whatever<00:00:50.460> we're<00:00:50.730> doing<00:00:50.940> both<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:52.410> up

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
whatever we're doing both with up

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860 
whatever we're doing both with up
aluminum<00:00:52.980> oxide<00:00:53.430> especially<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.390> any

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
aluminum oxide especially or any

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
aluminum oxide especially or any
metallic<00:00:55.170> substance<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.520> they're<00:00:56.670> making

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
metallic substance so they're making

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
metallic substance so they're making
that<00:00:57.059> each<00:00:57.539> individual<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.500> receptor<00:00:59.160> which

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that each individual a receptor which

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
that each individual a receptor which
makes<00:00:59.640> perfect<00:00:59.850> sense<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.590> have

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
makes perfect sense and they have

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.420 
makes perfect sense and they have
admitted<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.520> fried<00:01:03.030> heart<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.080> large

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
admitted the fried heart out on on large

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.390 
admitted the fried heart out on on large
population<00:01:05.430> areas<00:01:05.820> oh<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.689> name<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
population areas oh my name was one of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
population areas oh my name was one of
the<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.700> names<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.479> main<00:01:10.140> places<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the first names and main places that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.340 
the first names and main places that
they<00:01:11.159> tried<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.840> found<00:01:13.140> out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
they tried it out on and they found out

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
they tried it out on and they found out
that<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.270> easiest<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that the easiest thing they can do the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
that the easiest thing they can do the
simplest<00:01:17.340> thing<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.900> create

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
simplest thing they can do is to create

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.820 
simplest thing they can do is to create
alterations<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.400> mood<00:01:20.869> either<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:22.200> elation

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
alterations and mood either from elation

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.960 
alterations and mood either from elation
or<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.520> anger<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> depression<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.970> they

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
or to anger and depression and they

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
or to anger and depression and they
found<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.750> tremendous<00:01:28.619> high<00:01:28.799> suicide<00:01:29.220> rate<00:01:29.729> at

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
found a tremendous high suicide rate at

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.999 
found a tremendous high suicide rate at
that<00:01:30.000> time<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:31.049> found<00:01:31.229> domesticated

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that time they found domesticated

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
that time they found domesticated
animals<00:01:32.430> were<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:33.270> crazy<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.810> biting

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
animals were going crazy and biting

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.760 
animals were going crazy and biting
their<00:01:34.229> owners<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> yeah<00:01:36.840> alterations<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
their owners and so yeah alterations of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.359 
their owners and so yeah alterations of
moods<00:01:38.040> are<00:01:38.310> easily<00:01:38.759> affected<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.450> HAARP<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
moods are easily affected but HAARP and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.499 
moods are easily affected but HAARP and
depending<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> frequency<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:42.270> used

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
depending on the frequency they used

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.380 
depending on the frequency they used
they<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.840> also<00:01:43.140> make<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.340> elated<00:01:45.090> as<00:01:45.240> though

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they can also make you elated as though

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.859 
they can also make you elated as though
your<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.049> crotch<00:01:46.350> basically<00:01:47.720> but<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
your on your crotch basically but it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899 
your on your crotch basically but it
also<00:01:49.049> after<00:01:49.649> time<00:01:49.950> especially<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> aluminum

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
also after time especially the aluminum

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
also after time especially the aluminum
oxide<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.659> help<00:01:51.930> destroy<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.619> immune

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
oxide will help destroy your immune

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.120 
oxide will help destroy your immune
system<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> since<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
system and since they do this is the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.740 
system and since they do this is the
regular<00:01:56.640> television<00:01:57.380> CDC<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
regular television CDC you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.650 
regular television CDC you
and<00:01:59.220> BBC<00:02:00.220> news<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:01.300> keep<00:02:01.450> having

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
and BBC news to keep having

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.960 
and BBC news to keep having
international<00:02:02.590> conferences<00:02:03.250> every<00:02:03.430> month<00:02:03.790> or

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
international conferences every month or

international conferences every month or
so<00:02:04.000> talking<00:02:04.480> about<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.590> inevitable<00:02:06.660> flu

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
so talking about the inevitable flu

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.600 
so talking about the inevitable flu
that's<00:02:08.020> going<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.320> come<00:02:08.500> from<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.100> world<00:02:09.310> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
that's going to come from the world and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.910 
that's going to come from the world and
kill<00:02:09.880> most<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.420> people<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.590> they<00:02:11.770> keep

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
kill most of the people and they keep

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.040 
kill most of the people and they keep
saying<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.400> just<00:02:12.640> round<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.120> corner<00:02:13.150> just

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
saying is just round the corner just

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.960

round<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.500> corner<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.740> they<00:02:17.890> are<00:02:18.070> blowing

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
round the corner and so they are blowing

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.080 
round the corner and so they are blowing
our<00:02:19.240> resistance<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.440> fight<00:02:20.650> off<00:02:21.090> something

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
our resistance to fight off something

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.660 
our resistance to fight off something
but<00:02:22.270> should<00:02:22.540> not<00:02:22.750> tell<00:02:23.020> us<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:23.500> ever<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:24.520> we

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
but should not tell us but ever for we

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.430 
but should not tell us but ever for we
can<00:02:24.850> then<00:02:25.030> repent<00:02:25.360> our<00:02:25.480> resistance<00:02:25.990> then<00:02:26.290> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
can then repent our resistance then it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.090 
can then repent our resistance then it
probably<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.280> very<00:02:27.550> well<00:02:27.730> might<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.980> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
probably it very well might so this is
