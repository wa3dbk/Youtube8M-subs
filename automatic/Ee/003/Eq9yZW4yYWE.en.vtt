that<00:00:21.730> we<00:00:21.940> know<00:00:22.180> how<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.420> do<00:00:22.630> everything<00:00:22.780> or

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
that we know how to do everything or

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.950 
that we know how to do everything or
there's<00:00:23.980> no<00:00:24.040> reason<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.430> question<00:00:24.700> it<00:00:25.060> so

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
there's no reason to question it so

rotting rotting food in our lab it is

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.180 
rotting rotting food in our lab it is

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.010 
the future of food because where else
we're<00:00:33.550> going<00:00:33.790> to<00:00:33.969> find<00:00:34.180> new<00:00:34.360> flavors<00:00:34.809> where

and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:38.440> felt<00:00:38.710> again<00:00:39.039> well<00:00:39.519> it<00:00:40.030> has<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.420> be

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
and I just felt again well it has to be

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.970 
and I just felt again well it has to be
something<00:00:40.719> like<00:00:40.929> this<00:00:40.989> things<00:00:41.769> that<00:00:41.949> are

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
something like this things that are

I<00:01:17.060> find<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.659> interesting<00:01:18.950> with

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I find it really really interesting with

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
I find it really really interesting with
microbiology<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.820> food<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.990> always<00:01:22.140> found

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
microbiology in food and I always found

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
microbiology in food and I always found
it<00:01:22.530> interesting<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.979> begin<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> understand

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it interesting but I begin to understand

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.060 
it interesting but I begin to understand
just<00:01:24.479> now<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.110> recently<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> past

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just now like very recently for the past

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
just now like very recently for the past
maybe<00:01:26.280> 10<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.670> 12<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.180> 15<00:01:27.390> months<00:01:27.899> how<00:01:28.080> exactly

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
maybe 10 or 12 or 15 months how exactly

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.889 
maybe 10 or 12 or 15 months how exactly
important<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:30.000> everything<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
important to this for everything that

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.380 
important to this for everything that
leave<00:01:31.050> because<00:01:31.410> there<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.160> much<00:01:32.280> more

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
leave because there is so much more

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.700 
leave because there is so much more
microbiology<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.140> everything<00:01:34.679> we

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
microbiology going on in everything we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.969 
microbiology going on in everything we
consume<00:01:35.250> every<00:01:36.210> day<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.140> sort<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
consume every day then we sort of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.850 
consume every day then we sort of
imagined<00:01:38.429> you<00:01:38.520> know

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.270 

it's<00:01:45.850> an<00:01:45.970> untapped<00:01:46.470> part<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.590> culinary<00:01:48.160> world

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
it's an untapped part of culinary world

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's an untapped part of culinary world
I<00:01:48.460> think<00:01:48.490> people<00:01:49.240> know<00:01:49.390> about<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:50.050> know<00:01:50.170> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
I think people know about you know the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.160 
I think people know about you know the
fermentation<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.310> dairy<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.090> an<00:01:52.690> alcohol

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
fermentation and dairy and an alcohol

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.160 
fermentation and dairy and an alcohol
but<00:01:53.950> not<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:54.370> much<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.580> anything<00:01:54.940> else<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.540> I've

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
but not so much in anything else so I've

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.590 
but not so much in anything else so I've
got<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.350> learn<00:01:56.560> how<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.800> do<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.600> understand

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
got to learn how to do it and understand

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.110 
got to learn how to do it and understand
why<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.710> understand<00:02:00.100> why<00:02:00.280> now<00:02:00.970> it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
why and if you understand why now it

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.090 
why and if you understand why now it
works<00:02:01.330> maybe<00:02:01.780> we<00:02:02.020> can<00:02:02.170> make<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.410> better<00:02:02.530> in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
works maybe we can make it better in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.870 
works maybe we can make it better in
case<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.870> very<00:02:04.870> simply<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.860> give<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.580> often

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
case just very simply to give this often

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.749 
case just very simply to give this often
violent<00:02:07.300> be<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:07.930> Ebola<00:02:08.170> crisis<00:02:08.710> we<00:02:09.610> come

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
violent be like Ebola crisis we come

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.550 
violent be like Ebola crisis we come
