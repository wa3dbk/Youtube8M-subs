 hello everyone greets home queen and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.250
 family see you again I'm here with 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.250
 you in my kitchen 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.510
 good on this occasion we will prepare 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.360
 some quesadillas with yellow cheese 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.700
 These are for children and see that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.380
 kids love cheese so 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.470
 let's prepare our nightmares with 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.689
 yellow cheese the ingredients that 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.689
 let's use is the crowe cheese 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.570
 of yellow cheese 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.909
 and we're also going to use these tortillas 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.309
 of wholemeal flour these are good to me 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.320
 I love eating those tortillas and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.289
 let's hope that our warm 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.969
 comal to make our quesadillas 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.290
 well here we are going to warm our 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.140
 tortillas 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 this is for a breakfast and very fast and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.930
 very easy to prepare it so that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 our children have breakfast rich 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.710
 and this we are going to put our cheese 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.280
 thus 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 we are going to put the second one we are going to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 make 22 pieces of cheese and this 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.400
 we are going to fold in this way and the one that 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.450
 is heating up let's heat the other 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.450
 the second tortilla 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.340
 and that starts to cry 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.660
 then the same with the other 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.000
 well here we continue to brown the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.450
 quesadillas are already putting the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.450
 steps 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.700
 and to that that is melting so 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.500
 we are going to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.500
 when turning this around 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.499
 and so that you keep worshiping and of a 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.269
 that you knew you cut it into four 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:47.069
 pieces and this way he accommodates it 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.980
 to give it a style like a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.430
 flower or something like that for kids this one 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.879
 get excited and make them want to eat the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.950
