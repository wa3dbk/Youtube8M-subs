00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.889
 metropolitan and to go south of the 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.750

 leandro of its president Carlos Sierra 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.300
 We were talking to them because it's 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.560
 a club that on the one hand is a leader in 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.380
 the zone of the first metropolitan b 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.119
 with 21 units that this tournament still 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.980
 He is missing a lot and he has not only grown 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.750
 in football the Andes' but that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.789
 also in recent years he has done 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.079
 in the social part and this tells us 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.079
 its president Carlos closes 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:58.220
 and tell you that the theme of the project 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.140
 the pottery is to take up an initiative 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.660
 that at one time they had two partners 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.220
 that were the lord villain and the lord 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.909
 richard dunne where they had started a 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.049
 process of a sports center 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.069
 and they had focused for it a 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.079
 campaign where sponsors were requested to 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.329
 through the placement of a ceramic 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.579
 for the conformation of the sports center 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.469
 the hockey field has been completed 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.860
 synthetic there are three soccer fields 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.860
 synthetic where we are missing if there is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.160
 the perimeter wiring the lights in 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.500
 both courts and in the sector of 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.380
 wardrobe we lack some accessories and 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.290
 a boiler then what we aspire is 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.910
 that by appealing to the contribution of 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.240
 partner to be able to comply with all this 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.450
 stage 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.549
 and that this allows us as a club to have 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.090
 new and more income to follow 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.330

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.159

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 years it is incorporated this one degree 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.230
 new today we are counting at school 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.360
 with about 1100 students who 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.480
 they start from kindergarten 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.480
 until the end of the educational cycle 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.090
 here 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.269
 the day 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.019
 the first day we had 75 girls that 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.189
 they practiced but we had court 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.829
 then that practice was done in a 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.470
 baby soccer court went we saw each other 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.020
 totally exceeded by the amount of 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.720
 girls 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.150
 and so good during let's say until 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.040
 December they were adding up and we're going to 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.040
 Park practice as to what 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.140
 in the grass we no longer have a space 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.989
 physical to get organized to the activity 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.239
 until the president of the community 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.790
 is active he made a decision that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 we had to have a space for this 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.720
 that I'm going to repeat to include the 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.120
 woman who was what hand 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.280
 including the woman we bring to the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.420
 family to the club the andes they have to 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.610
 stop being a closed door club 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.680
 which opens every 15 days to see a 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.900
 football game and we have partners 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.080
 of 90 minutes we need 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.269
 partners 365 days a year and that is 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.739
 the partner that is going to sustain the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.090
 institution and that is going to make this 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.310
 club grows as it grows 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.310
 steadily in recent years
