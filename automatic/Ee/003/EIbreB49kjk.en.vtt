 although my friends call me line and today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.380
 I'm going to teach you how to make pancakes 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 americanta of these that are seen in the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.570
 movie when they eat breakfast 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.029
 accompanied by maple syrup and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.009
 Medical chocolate a little 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 teach to do that the truth that they are 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.189
 very rich 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 because they are super fluffy they are very 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.050
 easy to do they become very fast and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
 they leave a lot of quantity so any 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
 tomorrow I want to surprise her boyfriend 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 to your friend or a relative the baskets 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.239
 pancakes and I'm sure you 'll love them 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 so if you want to learn how to make a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.500
 American super shape pancake 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 simple and that are delicious follow 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.519
 seeing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 Well, for this recipe, we're going to need 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.089
 3 tablespoons of sugar I prefer it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.460
 icing sugar 200 grams of common flour 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:02.850
 a pinch of salt 250 milliliters of milk 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.119
 30 grams of butter or margarine and 4 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119
 eggs 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.159
 ah 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.009
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.229
 separate the white from the yolk as you can 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.310
 see is passing the yolk from one side to another 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.310
 from the egg shell 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.500
 and there would not be something like that 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.560
 in a big bowl we have to sift the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 200 grams of common flour sift the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.550
 go through the colander 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.280
 we also have to sift the three 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 tablespoons of icing sugar 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.159
 i 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 you can also use normal sugar 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.219
 but as I said earlier I 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.219
 I prefer this 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.410
 and we put a pinch of salt 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.660
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.950
 make a hole in the center and throw 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.650
 four buds 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.310
 we also have to cast the 250 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.440
 milliliters of milk 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.580
 and the 30 grams of butter margarine 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.590
 melted 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.900
 the next thing is to mix with some 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 rods little by little until you get a 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.280
 smooth and dense mass 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.880
 now we pass the whites to a container 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.600
 bigger and we have to beat them with 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.550
 the rods are about to snow 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.030
 at the point of snow as you can see in the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.069
 video is like meringue 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.410
 and now we incorporate it into the preparation 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.680
 above and we beat again with the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.680
 rods 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.379
 what we have to do now is 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.890
 grease our pan with a brush and 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.380
 some butter margarine 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.270
 and take out the mixture that we have 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.310
 prepared if you want your pancakes 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.740
 come out fatter and more fluffy 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.840
 they will throw more quantity of the mixture if 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.600
 you want them to come out finite they will throw 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.000
 least we have to be careful that 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.700
 do not burn us in the pan for that 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 we will put the fire in the middle down 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 and we have our pancake 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.430
 American made we can serve them well 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.209
 with liquid chocolate with whipped cream 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.300
 with jam with scrambled egg with 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.910
 maple syrup with bacon whatever you want 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.620
 you can see its texture is very spongy 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.660
 because of the egg whites that we have 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.760
 knocked down before snow point this what 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.010
 we use instead of using chemical yeast 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.820
 so our pancakes are healthier and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.820
 They are delicious 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.850

 terrific really are super fluffy

 we see in the next 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.199
 and there is already a soul south to the truth that it is a 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.479
 snack that is really delicious 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.389
 I have not seen it anywhere but I 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.770
 I just started putting the sweets 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.470
 and the fruits that I like we go to 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.740
 you can combine it with kiwi and orange 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.490
 that remains and the truth is that it remains super 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.319
 rich let me love it 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.419
 it does not matter if we leave, we choose 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.550
 We wipe it a little with a stick 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.550
 water and remove the space of rhythm 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.710
 two 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.840
 Finally, being a very make-up 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.300
 casual very natural let's paint 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.760
 our lips a pink tone 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.450
 brown but of course they are few in 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.450
 the 17 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.790
 and we are ready now only remains 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.790
 Strictly go out to the beach
