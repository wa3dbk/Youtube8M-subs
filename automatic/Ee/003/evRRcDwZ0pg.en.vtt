 Hi everyone, everything is good today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 hairs for you to talk about argan oil 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.050
 and macadamia oil which clearly indicates a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 you should already know that the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.910
 argan oil hair is a wonder 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.699
 these products that contain oil do the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 biggest success out there and some time ago 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.800
 also began the wave of the year of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.410
 Thinking of it the sage that is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 a Brazilian brand, it has developed a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 that the hairs containing these 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 two eyes that is the one here the seoul or 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.620
 it is understood that the complex oil then contains 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.660
 argan oil and macadamia oil is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 a wonder for the hair 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 so I'll talk a little bit about every 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 I look at you 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 the argan oil it has several 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 benefits but the main one is the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 hair regeneration does not know when 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 you look at the tip of your hair and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.670
 has the wires are tour part we had or 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.280
 with us 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.010
 or you stretch a little so the son and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 He comes back all the way around. 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 Usually, elastic hair is not 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 so this type of hair is what it is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.540
 requiring a regeneration so that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 it remains that natural format and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.280
 Just as cute as a hair 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 healthy then argan oil 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 provides this for your hair if 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.759

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 various benefits your hair leaves 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.810
 hair hula hoop and macadamia oil he 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.030
 has a main action that is anti 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 aging then let that hair 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 well loose snow hydrated with sparkle né 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.229
 because he deserves the covenant hair too 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.659

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 I do not know sage I had already done a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.270
 video talking about this this mask 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.259

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.450
 video talking about this mask to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.179
 who did not see will leave here and the same 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.420
 brand 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.939
 sage and since then I have been since 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.189
 I'm so loving this mark of truth. 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.760
 and the company sent me to test 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:24.840
 this oil and I already use several types of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.420
 oil in my hair use of fuchs use 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.430
 monopoly and are very good for the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.739
 hair I always recommend here for you 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.090
 but this one I liked a lot too 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.099
 very very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.540
 first because it is a brand 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.030
 Brazilian, right? 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.010
 second because it contains both eyes and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 third party because it can be used 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.099
 various forms 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.439
 so I'll tell you how you can 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.169
 use first way you can use the 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.260
 following the hair is to give a 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:56.469
 dried with the towel and apply the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
 product from the middle of the hair to 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.620
 tips 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.370
 this will leave your hair without frizz 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.739
 will dry it up in a more like way 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.230
 I can say with less volume 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.109
 so no frizz without lots of volume and more 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.680
 then it's really cool to get out of this 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.930
 form or other form that is legal for me to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.449
 I even used it today so I made a babyliss 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.699
 here at the end then to finish the 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:25.150
 Hair that when we do chaplo 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:27.459
 dryer is mobilized sometimes that is 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 the hairs are not creepy 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.229
 so I did I got some oil 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.659
 spread in their hands and gave 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:37.780
 I tapped like that and concentrated 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.449
 tips and this also helps with the frizz 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.970
 and moisturizing hair tips 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.979
 leaving another way you look brighter 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.319
 you can use this oil and adding a 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:49.180
 little in your hydration for example you 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.049
 I was making a rough one on this one of yours. 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.419
 mask and add bepantol thereto 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.400
 add a little of that oil too 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.009
 It will help you to nourish your 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.909
 hair and your mask will be more 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.829
 powerful 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.659
 Another cool thing that can make you 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.900
 can add a little of that eye to the 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.449
 your painting is not even making your 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.479
 painting stirring adds a bit of 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:16.599
 oil there it will help in your hair 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:18.969
 not become as dry as it gets when 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:22.180
 You do the painting without anything being without 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:25.240
 no moisturizer so it helps to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.940
 nourish at the time of the attitude what is legal 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.919
 that I at least when to do when 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.000
 I used to paint my hair a lot and he looked good 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.919
 resected 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.099
 Then those little eyes help you in the hour of 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.800
 painting as well and another way that 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.680
 super practical and makes a pretty cool effect 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 is to use it as a thermal protector then 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.270
 you apply a bit like the always the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.010
 half to the ends 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.710
 before making your hair dryer 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.919
 that it will help protect the wire and 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.820
 is not to dry out the damaged one due to 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.940
 heat you receive with these types of 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.240
 handsets then it's very cool this oil 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.789
 he has 90 ml this pack pink 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.279
 without a shout he arrived a couple of days ago 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.500
 weeks I'm using direct I felt 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.050
 that it gives an improvement in the accounts 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.810
 we differ mainly in different 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.880
 in the volume of hair I like and apply 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.560
 it after I got out of the bath so the 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.940
 wet hair 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.729
 so I apply and let it dry 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.639
 naturally cooler now because 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.380
 when I did the video of the assad mask 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.330
 I did not have an online store so a lot of people 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.240
 How are you asking how you're doing? 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.979
 It's not that I do not know how to respond 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.699
 so now they have opened an online store 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.500
