yeah i just put it on in the morning
under<00:03:20.920> night<00:03:21.130> before<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> go<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.610> bed<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.240> make

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
under night before I go to bed and make

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.160 
under night before I go to bed and make

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
yeah I think it has made a slight

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.710 
yeah I think it has made a slight
difference<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.750> far<00:03:29.850> partly<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> longer<00:03:31.480> use

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
difference so far partly the longer use

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.630 
difference so far partly the longer use
it<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.110> better<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.440> results<00:03:32.470> will<00:03:32.920> be<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.490> I'm

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
it the better the results will be so I'm

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.070 
it the better the results will be so I'm
going<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.880> carry<00:03:34.240> on<00:03:34.330> using<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
going to carry on using this and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.530 
going to carry on using this and
hopefully<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:36.490> will<00:03:36.730> get<00:03:37.000> rid<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.180> my<00:03:37.360> dark
