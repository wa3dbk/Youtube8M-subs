00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.390
 that there have been gamers this is your friend 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.700
 chintololo again has a video 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.730
 more on how to get your achievements in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.280
 plants versus zombies garden wafer today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.130
 I bring you this achievement that is called 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.529
 teletransport not for 10 g consisting 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.800
 in destroying a teleportation in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.499
 gardens and cemeteries with a plant 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.109
 this video is at the request of one of my 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.999
 subscriber what good that asked me 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 because when I got it I did not know 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.510
 what a wave it was from now, so the work of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.160
 pure chance 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 in fact the gameplay that I bring 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 right now is with my child's profile 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.480
 my son then this one that only 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.440
 because he did not have it there and I grabbed it for 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.780
 show them is exactly what a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.720
 teletransporter this teletransporter is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.820
 the only one who can build it is the 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.400
 engineer inside the zombies is the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 unique that you can build it in addition to 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.239
 that can only be built 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 after you've conquered 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.220
 first base not before then this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.990
 teleportation the purpose is that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.500
 When a zombie dies he uses a portal 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.509
 and it goes and sends you to that point on the map 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.509
 in such a way that you can advance very very 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.450
 fast abused nothing else there because then 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.979
 How is a portal in this portal? 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.840
 all the zombies that use it will be 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.509
 appearing at that point and lebanon 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.700
 you there as brave as I truly 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.229
 Well, they're going to kill them safely or 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.509
 unless it's super good I really 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.880
 I 'm not good but if you're super good 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.280
 you can easily defeat him there and very 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.580
 good and quickly what are you going to 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.590
 get here as you can see the only 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.229
 signal that I could see is that it is emitted towards 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.350
 the sky a little flash a small 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.140
 light this as if it were a soul that goes 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.380
 towards the sky something like that when a zombie 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.709
 he arrives there then when they see him near 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 from there they have to pay close attention 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.250
 definitely this but when I see it 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.530
 it means that they are very close 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.720
 As I was telling you, do not go crazy 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 well I 'm not leaving I can not go to what 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.739
 crazy because I'm not very good but I 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.690
 what did I do better 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.060
 right now, since they killed me, well, better 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.920
 look for an elevated position 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.620
 for this why I recommend that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.160
 use the pea crave true 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.160
 because this monkey this character is 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.830
 plant with its speed hypervisor 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.780
 can climb the rooftops then I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.630
 from a distance because the truth is that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.950
 I preferred to destroy the 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.150
 teleporter in a more way 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.849
 safe to a certain point and from afar 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.209
 then kill it truly because it has one that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.950
 it's bad one that is not so good at 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.959
 the video games true here is where they 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.060
 I'm going to start showing that if it's fixed 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.400
 in those little flashes on the floor 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.580
 that come out purple that wants 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.280
 say that there is the base also and that 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.810
 from them they fixed that little glint 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.310
 that goes to the sky 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.470
 Well, that means that the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 zombies there is the purple flash there 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.489
 I'm starting to destroy it and how I 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.799
 I said there you see all the zombies that 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.830
 they are arriving truth is the from the point 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.799
 from the previous portal and there good there 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.870
 I'm destroying it there, I better go 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.570
 because they were already killing me I have already 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.050
 little life I have half and already with me 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.960
 missing 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.840
 two more hits and with that I managed it until 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.120
 one hundred teleportation points destroyed 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.580
 and at that moment they will give you your 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.040
 achievement as you are seeing it on screen 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.140
 then unlocked teleportation is not 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.930
 for 10 g 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.810
 So, guys, that's how you get it 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.750
 this achievement that is what is a 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.030
 matte teleportation not from a distance and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.100
 in this case I use spear pea 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.770
 because you can climb roofs and from the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.210
 away without being quickly detected what 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.430
 you can be destroying without any 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.440
 problem another tip that I give them is that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.900
 look in the cloud of the portal is this 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.880
 that they see up there as if it were a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670
 nuclear bomb 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.050
 there is the portal they use to climb 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.120
 to teleport not the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.220
 teleporter but the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.380
 teleporter or the location must 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.750
 being very very close there is true 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.120
 question only that of what 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.250
 start looking for you to find it 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.350
 and what and what is destroyed is true and therefore 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.570
 good gentlemen your boy friend then you 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.520
 dismiss I hope you have found this 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.520
 useful video until soon
