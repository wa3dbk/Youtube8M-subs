plate on the one even says BTT kz1 but

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.959 
plate on the one even says BTT kz1 but
these<00:04:35.360> were<00:04:35.539> just<00:04:35.809> fun<00:04:36.639> and<00:04:37.639> when<00:04:37.849> you're

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969

stuck<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:43.400> can<00:04:43.580> do<00:04:43.759> sit<00:04:44.029> like<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.270> these

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
stuck you can do sit like this these

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.709 
stuck you can do sit like this these
parts<00:04:45.050> are<00:04:45.199> still<00:04:45.379> floating<00:04:45.710> around<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:47.330> same

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719 
parts are still floating around and same

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.420 
parts are still floating around and same
here<00:04:47.990> these<00:04:48.439> parts<00:04:48.800> are<00:04:48.949> still<00:04:49.159> floating

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
here these parts are still floating

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.480 
here these parts are still floating
around

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
around

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.879 
around
that<00:04:52.389> is<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.720> very<00:04:53.020> long<00:04:53.410> play

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
that is a very long play

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.689 
that is a very long play
as<00:04:55.159> this<00:04:55.370> one<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.680> don't<00:04:57.860> need<00:04:58.039> drag<00:04:58.370> bars

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
as this one and you don't need drag bars

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.429 
as this one and you don't need drag bars
on<00:04:58.999> these<00:04:59.180> because<00:04:59.539> they'll<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.199> keep

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
on these because they'll just keep

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.709 
on these because they'll just keep
 moving<00:05:01.370> they<00:05:02.060> don't<00:05:02.300> care<00:05:02.509> they're

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
 moving they don't care they're

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.510 
 moving they don't care they're
just<00:05:02.930> gonna<00:05:03.080> spin<00:05:03.349> that<00:05:03.499> back<00:05:03.740> tire<00:05:03.979> but

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
just gonna spin that back tire but

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.600 
just gonna spin that back tire but
that's<00:05:04.789> that<00:05:05.180> extended<00:05:05.719> swing<00:05:05.930> arm

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
that's that extended swing arm

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.950 
that's that extended swing arm
which<00:05:07.610> never<00:05:07.849> makes<00:05:08.120> sense<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.599> me<00:05:08.749> because

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
which never makes sense to me because

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.360 
which never makes sense to me because
that<00:05:09.199> makes<00:05:09.529> them<00:05:09.740> into<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:09.979> straight<00:05:10.340> line

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
that makes them into a straight line
