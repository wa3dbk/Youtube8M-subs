 are not 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.720
 other sites such as dj dollars 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.470
 since they have various interesting 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.469
 functions and for example the display function 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.670
 sound wave of three years you can score in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 convenient composition analysis function 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 another advantage 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 the internet are often djs often 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.620
 quarters these sites will help you 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.440
 familiarize yourself with the work of the DJ 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010
 most get interesting 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.910
 sentence 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.210
 and here we have two tracks that we 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.980
 need to bring we already know how it is 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.660
 done but necessary also 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.420
 know at what point and how to perform 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.370
 Information here are some tips with 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.300
 considering how good you are 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.189
 familiar record and how much psm 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.149
 first doing morning spending here 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.849
 first fragment in 60 seconds of one track 

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:20.289
 superimposed on the last fragment 90 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.679
 seconds of another track which is now 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.679
 reproduced let's start 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.760
 as always we meet this track with 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.350
 the beginning of the new year 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 Yes of course 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800
 gradually raising the level to 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 achieve smoothness 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 a little tidying up the bases to prevent 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 low frequency conflict 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.540
 if this is not done then mixing can 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 occur on the payment of benefits 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.220
 Here we reduce the level of wrestlers in Africa 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 which we go to the threshold we rise 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
 actor 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.680
 as recalled that games should be 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.259
 the top of an emphasis is established 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 at the end of them we run it twitter 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 we have executed neither the central bank ecb 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.129
 DPS post 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.309
 the day after them zhiruya about 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.169
 imposition of cops alone on 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.579
 other 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.579
 let me show 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 we know what the beginning of the next 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 we spend our victims creating a mix 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.339
 sound experienced end 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.099
 it brings new elements forming 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.099
 additional dynamics 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.779
 all you need to do is take out the project 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.779
 just in time 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.329
 here 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:51.839
 but experiment with 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.249
 EQ tidying up not scored hash 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.249
 table radiation was as much as possible meter 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.089
 iv 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.439
 you hear that now the elements and this 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.999
 The tracks and elements for this track are beautiful. 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.999
 overlap each other 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.709
 of course achieve such harmony 

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.689
 quite difficult but when it succeeds 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.689
 sound pleases 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.939
 0 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.229

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.990
 to 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.990
 and before the end will be 1 13 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.020
