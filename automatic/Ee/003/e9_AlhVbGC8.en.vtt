00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 today i will show you how i got the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hair done so because that's all 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.899
 was frequently requested 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.179
 and it's really easy 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 tutorial and the nice thing is when I have it 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.490
 then you get it too 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.110
 down 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 and the reason for that is I have 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.910
 No talent for hair at all 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 I really do not use one 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 straighteners you can use any straightening iron 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 use that you have at home and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 so that lure me in front of me later 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 a little bit more what I am there 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.460
 used what exactly I use small 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 warning this is not a hairstyle you 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 Every day I should style this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 not every day but actually 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 that's why they are relatively rare 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 Hair broke and you should 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.800
 Do not use flat irons every day 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.480
 at least my experience but otherwise 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.480
 just have fun and succeed 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.580
 for the new audience of you mine 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 By nature, hair is like that 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.470
 really quite shaggy and fluid and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.180
 naturally lured and like me 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.510
 So in the last videos 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.280
 the 34 videos before this video 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 so they are if I have one with them 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.870
 straightening iron and hair spray 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.670
 has and that is really quite whole 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.320
 just imitate that you can 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.910
 do if you have very straight hair 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.310
 By nature, you can do that if 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.110
 you make such hair is curled so 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.580
 like mine or even curlier than 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.040
 my main focus is on you 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.640
 straighteners I recommend you too 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.170
 if I'm very very slippery 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.330
 I have heat protection spray to use 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.340
 bought it extra just for this video 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.610
 so that I can go forward with a good role model 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.170
 because I often forget it too 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.149
 use and it really is really 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.710
 important heat spray we use the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.240
 Otherwise hair can break 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.310
 I do not have this one yet 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.970
 tried it comes from l'oreal that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 end deluxe 230 degree heat styling spray 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:52.509
 for curls we take a bit of 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.119
 the spray and spray a little something 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.830
 in the use of the tips and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.630
 that I always do now is the hair 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.039
 divide into two parts so easy 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.740
 make a mid-top in the back 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.399
 and now I am with such kämmerchen 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.630
 the hair high but take me such a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.569
 small part 1 2 strähnchen raus der 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.240
 Rest with screwed up and up 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.130
 stuck that is the easiest for me 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.349
 method next you need one 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 brush you know i love love love 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.950
 the tangled elisa that's just the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.690
 even brush through my dry ones 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.099
 Hair comes through and no other 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.709
 do that and now I just had to 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.110
 the whole party down here and through 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.849
 Now I take hairspray that I take 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.950
 not just at the end but maybe 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 you know the trick before I start 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.280
 with the flat iron somehow over the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 to go hair speak the strand 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.810
 bit with hairspray 1 and 2 strand 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.599
 for strand up and down 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.959
 and it will be much much more 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.580
 give 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.110
 Please take care that the hair is completely 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.640
 are completely dry before you with the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.260
 flat iron starts to do something 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.400
 because otherwise you will damage them very much 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.500
 if she could be a bit too 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.270
 So wet are the house primus 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.160
 be dried and now I take mine 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.500
 flat iron and that is one that is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.800
 Unleashed five years old it is from 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 brown and that is the headliner 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.150
 can appear up to 200 degrees maximum 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.920
 I now have the heat level too 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 just because it is with me then 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.030
 It's easier to go faster and me 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 get a better result and now 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.010
 I start at the first train 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.900
 the whole thing has the whole strand too 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.989
 So I'm really doing nothing 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.190
 other than over here so and go 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.590
 you see now the strand is one 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.150
 little bit louder than 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.140
 Now, of course, here on the side 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.680
 the hair looks a bit too 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.569
 longer 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.269
 so and now comes the whole trick 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.230
 in the half, the hair around the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:53.709
 straightening iron and straightening iron 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.410
 is also pulled through that I am 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.870
 Only loose off the end was that really that 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:06.600
 I do not do more hair 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.600
 pinned tangled isa hairspray 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.360
 ok and in the end I want to at the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.430
 pony partie arrived 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.289
 these are those few straps here me 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.669
 I have already brushed and now there 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.320
 It's a two things I still say 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.330
 wanted should perhaps note you 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.830
 First of all, I take the pony 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.630
 always very much more 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.430
 Hairspray than the rest of the hair 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.600
 that works with this one you have here 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.699
 wonderful because it's not the hair 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.539
 I really would not stick otherwise 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:58.350
 So I like a lot 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.090
 hair spray and the reason why we like that 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.830
 a lot of hairspray is just that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.400
 Of course, the game is beautifully preserved 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.199
 should 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.669
 that is of course that if you are in the 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.949
 mirror looks what you notice immediately 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.020
 so that should really be possible 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.539
 Good and the really important 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 even more important is the stop 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.410
 that the whole point outwards so 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.669
 really out of the face shows so 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.710
 as I have this on this page already 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.509
 made the strand go out and 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.860
 she does not face her so you 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.830
 the straightening iron already in the 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.690
 turn right direction and not after 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.520
 turn inside because you otherwise the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.750
 have hair in the eye and that is 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.849
 Of course not what you necessarily 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.949
 and if you want to get in 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.120
 magazines or watching TV 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.860
 looks and looks like the whole 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.810
 presenter in her hair 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.550
 they really do have them quite often 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.919
 In these cases, to the outside that is the 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.720
 which most of all is best and 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.199
 that's why i show you how that too 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.930
 going 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.789
 So that's exactly how it works 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.310
 like what I did before 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.570
 I have just shorter here 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.050
 That's why I'm catching hair too 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:05.340
 a little earlier with the straightener 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:06.900
 to form that curl about here and there 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.860
 the strand in front can calmly strong 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.080
 be enticed 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.289
 the suffering in the course of the day a bit 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.909
 if that's really your thing 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.409
 should be very curly if you 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.139
 maybe smooth hair by nature 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:22.860
 then you can do it all 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.539
 bit by brushing at the end could 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.889
 also just use less hairspray 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.990
 then you will only wave so lightly 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.800
 only with me that would be easy 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.419
 do not hold 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.639
 then I would already have on this 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.650
 no lure anymore if the 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.270
 Hair is quite smooth and that is not 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.689
 what I really stand for 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.069
 ok and for the finished result 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.749
 and I really hope that you guys 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.610
 the video helped i hope that 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:45.739
 I could explain it reasonably well 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.329
 if you have any questions then ask 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:49.699
 I like to answer all of you 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:50.839
 comments that I find and that I find 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.429
 just not overlooked 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.139
 I hope the tutorial I had fun 

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:57.610
 i made it fun i did 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.610
 I'm looking forward to the next video until then
