that works here if you come down to this

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.070 
that works here if you come down to this
portion<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> rack<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.789> build<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.750> racks

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
portion of the rack we build these racks

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
portion of the rack we build these racks
to<00:00:19.320> sit<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:19.980> call<00:00:20.130> these<00:00:20.310> camper<00:00:20.820> pads

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to sit on what we call these camper pads

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.109 
to sit on what we call these camper pads
these<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:21.750> strong<00:00:22.230> heavy<00:00:22.920> duty<00:00:23.400> steel

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
these are very strong heavy duty steel

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.980 
these are very strong heavy duty steel
camper<00:00:24.869> pads<00:00:25.050> they're<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.529> 3/16<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:27.420> pad

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
camper pads they're about 3/16 a pad

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.859 
camper pads they're about 3/16 a pad
very<00:00:28.560> very<00:00:28.920> stout<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.580> leg<00:00:29.849> comes<00:00:30.179> down<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very very stout the leg comes down and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
very very stout the leg comes down and
is<00:00:31.260> actually<00:00:31.560> welded<00:00:32.250> right<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> pad<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
is actually welded right to the pad so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000 
is actually welded right to the pad so
it's<00:00:33.510> offset<00:00:34.079> from<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> bed<00:00:34.620> rail<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it's offset from the bed rail of the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's offset from the bed rail of the
truck<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.420> allows<00:00:36.719> their<00:00:37.230> space

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
truck and that just allows their space

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.799 
truck and that just allows their space
for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> camper<00:00:38.790> shell<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.120> slid<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
for the camper shell to be slid in and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.200 
for the camper shell to be slid in and
out<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.579> we<00:00:41.579> also<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.920> full-length<00:00:44.210> bed

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
out of we also have a full-length bed

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
out of we also have a full-length bed
rail<00:00:45.480> basically<00:00:46.140> by<00:00:46.350> putting<00:00:46.739> flat<00:00:47.070> bar

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rail basically by putting flat bar

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.670 
rail basically by putting flat bar
connecting<00:00:47.969> those<00:00:48.120> pads<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> does

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
connecting those pads and what that does

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
connecting those pads and what that does
it<00:00:49.860> allows<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.550> weight<00:00:50.940> distribution<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it allows for weight distribution and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
it allows for weight distribution and
just<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.829> structural<00:00:53.430> integrity<00:00:54.000> on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just some more structural integrity on

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.330 
just some more structural integrity on
the<00:00:54.270> rack<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:56.489> racks<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:57.180> fully<00:00:57.750> welded

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
not tubing and the pipe is very

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
not tubing and the pipe is very
structurally<00:01:09.540> sound<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.930> domestically

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
structurally sound it's domestically
