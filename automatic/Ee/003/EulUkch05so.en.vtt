00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.519
 Yes No 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.680
 to me 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.290
 we are in the final evening of 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.079
 dedicated celebrations in honor of the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.530
 holy crucifix has fallen and we are 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.720
 in the company of different twins than between 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.269
 very few hours will go on stage for 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.800
 kick off their concert 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.650
 this is a first tour you do 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.530
 alone 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.380
 what your fans will have to wait for 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.880
 who will be here tonight to see them 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.080
 live 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.370
 then prove that we are specified 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.890
 alone because we are two different twins 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.990
 has become we are really happy with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.940
 pass us these parts involved 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.850
 we have been in these sixteen years of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.980
 career the people of Puglia I always have 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.600
 loved if they had never been to 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.430
 galatone moment it seems that a need a 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.890
 galatone we've never been I don't know if I can 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 tell galatina maybe not because they were there 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.910
 the good internal struggles we are 7 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.410
 galatina many years ago when 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.760
 we started our career and 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.260
 so I guess that's between galatina 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.790
 galatone is not that there is all this 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.290
 difference there have always been 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 great of us we are sure that 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.369
 even the rivalry between Bergamo and Brescia this evening 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.530
 Ghanaians enter it seems to me we are 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.140
 overjoyed then to start 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.910
 our tour in apulia and score 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.400
 here in galatro we say that we must 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.540
 wait for the first one to say a 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.430
 journey through our music 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.190
 through 16 years in the months to lavish themselves 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.840
 which fortunately went through 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.970
 several generations of this music 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.920
 we also want to give it new ones 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.750
 generations the ones that maybe have us 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.480
 heard only by mistake or otherwise not 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.970
 has followed our career since 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.370
 start that in 98 that says evening will be a 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.050
 journey to be our songs like 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.820
 readers a good start because we are i 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.340
 two different twins and today the very 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.350
 pint so if you see us like that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.459
 thesis because we too the emotion of 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.459
 stage already in place 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.380
 in a world 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.069
 no 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.790
 it matters a lot 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.100
 I remember 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.960
 here it is a bit then there will be a beautiful one 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.730
 novelty from the scenic point of view because 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.220
 on stage besides me to you but clearly 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.310
 there will be a band of three elements there will be 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.260
 a keyboard a guitar and a bass e 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.910
 in console there will be a girl who 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.770
 he has with a dj who will accompany us in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 this tour will therefore be a training 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.360
 let's say beautiful unpublished 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.970
 put the future plans the engraving of 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.549
 a new album so what this 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.709
 we must expect from you in the future 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.349
 look at today we want to carry around 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.849
 as much builders as possible because much 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.000
 right 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.370
 we will space from 98 to 2014 therefore with 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.730
 all our pieces then from here a year 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.829
 at two years something new will happen but 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.959
 there will also be some shows during the show 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.510
 surprises that we will not limit ourselves only 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.230

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.950
 different twins 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.139
 but in my opinion to some song that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.819
 will capture someone's attention there 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.379
 will therefore also expect some 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.180
 surprises during the world of ours 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.540
