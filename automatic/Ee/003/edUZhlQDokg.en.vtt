I'll keep chugging and then eventually

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.130 
I'll keep chugging and then eventually
it<00:05:30.570> will<00:05:30.750> get<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.410> UM<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:32.280> device<00:05:32.520> s<00:05:32.760> off

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
it will get the UM the device s off

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.750
