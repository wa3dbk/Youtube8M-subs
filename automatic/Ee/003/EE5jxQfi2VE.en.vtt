00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.790 
adjunct professor of biology and we're
going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> talk<00:00:09.660> about<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.139> blood<00:00:10.349> cells<00:00:10.559> of

I'm<00:00:17.970> gonna<00:00:18.119> do<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.420> analogy<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
I'm gonna do a little analogy for you

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
I'm gonna do a little analogy for you
our<00:00:20.070> bodies<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.699> much<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> big<00:00:21.300> city<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
our bodies are much like a big city and

waste<00:00:54.270> around<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.170> take<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> co2<00:00:55.800> back

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
