 congratulate you by choosing to roll up code 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.099
 good guys this video tutorial has the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 purpose of presenting our aircraft 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.430
 of co - pilots in ground school 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.809
 or is a beginner pilot who is the cessna 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.059
 172 the default number 9 of the flight itself 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.370
 simulator of both x and 2004 with 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.250
 In order to practice, open your 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.660
 flight simulator choose this aircraft 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.220
 a cessna 172 to choose the ship go 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 to the aircraft select aircraft menu 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:13.229
 of all available aircraft 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:17.369
 choose cessna 172 and an ok so that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.170
 the system can load there in the sequence 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.460
 let's choose the aerodrome says 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.250
 today's training that florianópolis 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:34.619
 sierra bravo foxtrot lime go to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:37.979
 number the word guti the contribution there in the neighborhood 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 airport haide let's type ecall 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.060
 from this airport leave the island that is 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.750
 bravo foxtrot lime never connect in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 headwaters or runways on the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.240
 If here Florianopolis has two 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 clues 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.960
 let's choose a position on the patio in the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.439
 gate I chose here the position of the gate and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.890
 three of ok to load the system 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.890
 flight 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.830
 and notice that I'm already logged in 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.280
 Florianópolis solo 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.160
 by the way a very beautiful day here in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.150
 Santa Catarina 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.240
 I invite you to enter this aircraft 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 so that together we can know the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.250
 instruments and their functionalities 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.860
 now yes inside the cessna 172 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.800
 let's meet the main 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 instruments and their functionalities 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.880
 Let's start from left to right. 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.550
 here on the left we have the manometer 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.400
 rugar known as a pump of 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.830
 fuel fuel gauge 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.250
 we have here on the left side east of 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 right side which is a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.190
 right tank left tank 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.330
 below the ground on the subway we have the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.340
 instrument that measures information from the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.709
 oil on the left side we have here 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.050
 oil temperature and right side 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.360
 we have oil pressure when the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.760
 aircraft is on 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.220
 these two instruments must be 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.970
 marking with its indicator in the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.340
 green 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.880
 good it is almost the center of the aircraft we 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.330
 here we have the speedometer that is a 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.350
 instrument that will measure the speed of 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.830
 aircraft on right side knots perceive 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.970
 that has a white stripe that rate 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.320
 indicates acceptable speed for flap 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.010
 the aircraft ranging from 40 to 85 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.090
 we 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.780
 above it is not suitable for use 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.260
 flap no cessna 172 we also have the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:13.670
 green indicator ranging from almost 45 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:16.350
 50 us up to 125 almost 130 knots that is the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.209
 speed indicated for flight 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.530
 do not cease 172 above that in yellow already 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.870
 not indicated 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.870
 much less from yellow 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.010
 on the right side of the speedometer we have 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.810
 here the artificial horizon when 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.740
 aircraft is connected that is the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.310
 horizon will be aligned when doing 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.530
 downhill and uphill curves 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.030
 you will notice a movement in this 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.620
 artificial horizon 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.520
 below it we have the course here the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.280
 evidences 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.430
 also known as wheel of the winds 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.740
 are 360 ​​degrees when the aircraft is 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.580
 on autopilot 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.240
 you can move here in control of 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.300
 hdg which is the control of evidence and directions and 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:15.810
 aircraft will follow precisely the bow 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.850
 direction you set up beside 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.310
 right of the artificial horizon 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.370
 we have the altimeter an instrument of the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:27.350
 altimeter is your altitude reference 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.350
 in relation to sea level 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.930
 remembering that we are connected in the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.880
 floor of florianópolis florianópolis in 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.630
 a seaside town 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.960
 soon we are a few meters up 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.880
 at the sea level 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.520
 perceive this information because the two 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.390
 hands are marking almost in the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.980
 zero so few meters above the sea 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.340
 the altimeter will be your instrument of 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.260
 reference when flying below the 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.420
 altimeter we have an instrument of the 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:07.460
 vertical speed when marked as now 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:12.600
 at zero means you are level 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:16.460
 or ground or vertical flight speed is a 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.800
 instrument that measures the angle of ascent 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:24.840
 and descent of your aircraft 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:29.080
 the rate of rise or the rate of descent 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:33.430
 recommended for cessna 172 is up to one thousand 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:36.280
 feet above that we're putting in 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.629
 the structure of the aircraft and of the 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.509
 passengers below the vertical speed we 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:46.300
 we have an rpm instrument that is a 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.580
 instrument that measures the applied power 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.819
 to the engine 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.430
 obviously in a take-off procedure 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:58.979
 It is the moment when we will give more 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.979
 power and we will require more of the engine 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.800
 This is it people these are the main 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.349
 instruments of cessna 172 a small 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.020
 general revision from the left to the 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:13.330
 right we have a manometer that is the 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.219
 instrument that will measure the amount of 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.099
 fuel on board 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:20.289
 below it oil control 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:25.060
 temperature and pressure 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:27.810
 here we have the side speedometer 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.180
 his right the artificial horizon 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:35.110
 below it the rose of the winds that the course 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.630
 and bow on the right side we have here 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.509
 altimeter that will measure your altitude in 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:45.969
 vertical sea level 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:48.759
 which is the ratio of rise and fall and rpm 

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:51.069
 that the engine power control 

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:54.300
 these are the main instruments of the 

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.300
 cessna 172 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:59.110
 That's it folks in the next tutorial 

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:00.779
 we will learn to connect the aircraft one 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.610
 once it is fully 

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:06.430
 off this was the first tutorial 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.190
 introduction to the instruments and their 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:12.750
 main features big hug 

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.750
 and see you later
