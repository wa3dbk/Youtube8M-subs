 because I'm doing too much 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.659
 hair and I feel like it was because of the dye 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 for using the beach and I felt it a little 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.420

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.880
 factors that is the feeding the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.410
 stress or also the bad care that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.810
 we give our hair all this 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.740
 it affects so that our hair falls out 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.270
 in a myriad of factors but obvious that 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.820
 the feeding you have to be 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.830
 eating well healthy nutritious for 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.920

 reflect that we are very good this oil 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.400
 I was using it for treatment 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.790
 intense and I loved it so much in my skin in 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.550
 my body and of course in my 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.620
 hair you can see my hair is 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.230
 look healthy 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:26.620
 what I do is that I grab oil 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.280
 and I put it in my souls 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.040
 and the fruits to create a warmth and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.110
 then I start to rub all my 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.849
 hair all the roots of my hair 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.060
 I start to eat the root and then I continue 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.269
 towards the ends to nourish the hair 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.099
 the thermal cap was not used sometimes 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.590
 I just do a little bit I leave it 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.500
 there for half an hour sometimes all day 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.690
 to those I sleep with him also depending 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.299
 like my hair and see how I feel me 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.859
 I went to bathe and only rinse with 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.209
 this shampoo and then use the 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.540
 conditioner when my hair was 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.629
 wet do not use any brush what 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.870
 I do is always like I treat myself 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.449
 detangle hair with fingers 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.250
 the nails I always do this and always 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.579
 I'm careful when I'm doing it 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.190
 because when the hair is wet it is 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.080
 very very fragile I have felt a great 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.840
 difference with these products are 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.880
 very good has argan oil not 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.199
 they have many chemicals that are very 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.330
 strong and harmful to not 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.539
 another thing that I like about these shampoos 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.389
 is that they do not do any exams with 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:46.770
 animals and this the truth that he deserves 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.889
 a super applause is made with 99% of 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.080
 vegetable that is super cool I 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.419

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.120
