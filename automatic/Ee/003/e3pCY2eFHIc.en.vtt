00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.389
 they live among hills in houses of plates 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.430
 practically without eating and the 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.439
 Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.390
 Look for them to evade taxes by having 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.340
 made millionaire banking movements 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320
 the figure reaches 40 million 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.810
 weights but estimate that this could 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.670
 rise even more it's about 40 neighbors 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.259
 from the irregular colony the waterfalls 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.000
 located in culiacán that makes 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.280
 about a year they acted good 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.589
 faith after a neighbor ask him 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.239
 to each one separately that they did 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.879
 the favor of opening an account in the bank 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.190
 hsbc because he did not have a credential 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.539
 elector and deposit him in a money what 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.120
 which they accepted to see in the conditions 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.219
 in which the young man lived however 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.590
 for that favor today ten people are 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.899
 being required by hacienda to have 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.030
 evaded taxes such is the case of a 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.129
 young man of only 20 years without money 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.620
 to feed his two children he agreed to 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.780
 this request because in return your neighbor will 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.879
 gave away two hundred pesos amount that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.560
 now he wishes never to have received 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.140
 you have to answer for the taxes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.210
 generated by the demand deposit account their 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 behalf of more than four million 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 we did not know we did not know 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.800
 I did not know what we were doing 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 as he said that nothing was wrong 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.120
 I really did not want to go but he told me 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 nothing will happen nothing will happen 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.730
 and how he told me he was going to give me 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.140
 I was going to give 200 pesos I thought 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.140
 because even for the tortillas had 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.210
 well I get more more 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.530
 because I have my children with me was 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.720
 last Tuesday when he got the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.370
 requirements and from that moment on 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.470
 they have been able to live the same way, although 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.330
 the legal terms understand the single 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.430
 see the millionaire figures does not leave them 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.770
 be in peace so he shared it to the line 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.810
 direct another of the affected ones that says 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.910
 be so desperate that you have thought of 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.860
 sell what little you have however not 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.350
 it would reach him then his debts according to 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 Hacienda exceeds half a million pesos 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.100
 If I have thought the truth 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.140
 even how to do it already broke my 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 head how to pay that but then 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.830
 I do not reach or sell my 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.990
 house another of those affected who by 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.520
 fear also omits his name indicated that 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.950
 already went to the secretariat of finance 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.510
 to try to solve your situation without 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640
 But they were not given a possible 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.530
 solution as poor or rich have to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.510
 answer for the accounts that are 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.860
 their names for their part the president 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.510
 of the defense commission of the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.160
 human rights leonel aguirre meza 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
 who is advising the 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.209
 affected said they do not have 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.340
 knowledge of other similar cases what 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.730
 which I do not doubt that it is about washing 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.730
 money 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.830
 relatively not going to happen 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.690
 against them these days 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.070
 for that in the research however 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.560
 they have to show that they form your 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.330
 professions work or postal 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.260
 it's very unfair that you use 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 people of limited resources 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.020
 until the afternoon of this Friday will be 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.790
 Meza was requesting a 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.440
 audience with the Attorney General 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.660
 of the state marco antonio higuera gómez 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.060
 hoping that I can give them 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.500
 some solution in direct line 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.500
