later unlock that if you'd like you know
just<00:02:15.000> by<00:02:15.120> playing<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.480> game<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:15.690> ranking<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.820> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
just by playing a game and ranking up so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.080 
just by playing a game and ranking up so
that's<00:02:18.060> why<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:19.320> know<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> guess<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.160> didn't

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
that's why I you know I guess I didn't

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.960 
that's why I you know I guess I didn't
think<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.720> something<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.400> was<00:02:23.400> worth

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
think that was something that was worth

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.090 
think that was something that was worth
getting<00:02:24.300> because<00:02:24.600> if<00:02:24.960> those<00:02:25.260> skins<00:02:25.590> are<00:02:25.890> not

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
getting because if those skins are not

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.120 
getting because if those skins are not
available<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> future<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.130> then
