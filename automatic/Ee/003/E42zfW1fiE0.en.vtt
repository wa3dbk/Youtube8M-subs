00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
in a bar four beats

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:27.570 
in a bar four beats
so<00:01:13.479> one<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.080> two<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.800> three<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.520> four<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:26.580> so

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
so one and two and three and four and so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.889 
so one and two and three and four and so
then<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.850> next<00:01:28.000> step<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.390> then<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.570> sort<00:01:28.810> of

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
then the next step is then to sort of

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.410 
then the next step is then to sort of
mix<00:01:29.289> up<00:01:29.530> these<00:01:29.800> faster<00:01:30.580> notes<00:01:30.789> with<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.180> slow

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
mix up these faster notes with the slow

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.290 
mix up these faster notes with the slow
notes<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.320> also<00:01:32.560> do<00:01:32.860> slower<00:01:33.820> notes<00:01:34.119> the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
notes you can also do slower notes the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.760 
notes you can also do slower notes the
idea<00:01:34.539> if<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.690> can<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:35.020> something<00:01:35.560> quite

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
idea if you can have something quite

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.469 
idea if you can have something quite
slow<00:01:36.160> such<00:01:36.520> as<00:01:36.700> starting<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.149> middle<00:01:37.420> of

backwards for example Marco one in with
that<00:02:01.990> simple<00:02:02.350> idea<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.619> come<00:02:02.979> up<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.189> some

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
that simple idea you come up with some

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.230 
that simple idea you come up with some
good<00:02:03.490> ideas<00:02:03.549> so<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.619> now<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.399> will<00:02:06.549> glue<00:02:07.000> that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
good ideas so so now we will glue that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.330 
good ideas so so now we will glue that
all<00:02:07.420> together<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:08.380> different<00:02:08.769> with<00:02:08.920> them<00:02:09.040> so<00:02:09.310> I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
all together so different with them so I

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.230 
all together so different with them so I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
like this is a blues tune or a rock song

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.070 
like this is a blues tune or a rock song
or<00:02:38.560> whatever<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:38.950> you're<00:02:39.130> playing<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
or whatever it is you're playing so the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.080 
or whatever it is you're playing so the
other<00:02:41.200> next<00:02:41.710> step<00:02:41.890> from<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.790> start

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
other next step from that is to start

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
other next step from that is to start
skipping<00:02:43.450> notes<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.960> scale<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.560> far

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
skipping notes in the scale so so far

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.960 
skipping notes in the scale so so far
I've<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.220> just<00:02:45.250> been<00:02:45.400> running<00:02:45.760> up<00:02:45.850> and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
I've really just been running up and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.940 
I've really just been running up and
down<00:02:46.030> bits<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.960> scale<00:02:47.230> which<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.560> okay<00:02:47.890> but

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
down bits of the scale which is okay but

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.010 
down bits of the scale which is okay but
it<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.340> get<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.520> bit<00:02:48.580> sort<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:48.970> boring<00:02:49.900> and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
it can get a bit sort of boring and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.170 
it can get a bit sort of boring and
predictable<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.950> next<00:02:51.130> step<00:02:51.400> will<00:02:51.880> stick

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
predictable so the next step will stick

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.360 
predictable so the next step will stick
now<00:02:52.330> just<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.720> using<00:02:53.050> OneNote<00:02:53.650> kerb<00:02:54.040> meeting

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
now just to using OneNote kerb meeting

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.100 
now just to using OneNote kerb meeting
unis<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> skip<00:02:55.300> certain<00:02:55.600> notes<00:02:55.930> as

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
unis I'm going to skip certain notes as

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.800 
unis I'm going to skip certain notes as
we<00:02:56.230> go<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.790> example<00:02:58.390> I'm<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.570> going

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
we go up so for example I'm just going

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.660 
we go up so for example I'm just going
to<00:02:58.870> randomly<00:02:59.440> skip<00:02:59.710> notes<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.340> down<00:03:00.490> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
to randomly skip notes up and down the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:15.059 
to randomly skip notes up and down the
scale

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.110 

and<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.220> forth<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.520> can<00:03:16.670> do<00:03:16.730> lots<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:17.060> things

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and so forth you can do lots of things

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.290 
and so forth you can do lots of things
like<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.920> other<00:03:19.130> idea<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.209> you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
like that so the other idea is that you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.970 
like that so the other idea is that you
can<00:03:20.450> start<00:03:20.660> repeating<00:03:21.020> notes<00:03:21.290> if<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.560> have

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
can start repeating notes if you have

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.740 
can start repeating notes if you have
two<00:03:22.220> or<00:03:22.310> three<00:03:22.489> notes<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.940> really<00:03:23.360> like<00:03:23.569> you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
two or three notes you really like you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.300 
two or three notes you really like you
can<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.050> repeat<00:03:24.349> those<00:03:24.620> over<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.069> over

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
can just repeat those over and over

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:35.020 
can just repeat those over and over
again<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:25.819> something<00:03:26.690> like<00:03:33.730> it's<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> really

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
again so something like it's a really

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.910 
again so something like it's a really
simple<00:03:35.330> but<00:03:35.420> effective<00:03:35.660> idea<00:03:36.110> that's<00:03:36.410> used<00:03:36.709> in

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
simple but effective idea that's used in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.380 
simple but effective idea that's used in
lots<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.459> other<00:03:37.610> things<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.030> another<00:03:38.269> example

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
lots of other things so another example

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.199 
lots of other things so another example
might<00:03:38.989> go<00:03:39.319> backwards

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.420 

something<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.260> my<00:03:46.799> simple<00:03:47.069> idea

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
something like that so my simple idea

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.860 
something like that so my simple idea
this<00:03:47.609> all<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.909> need<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.569> either

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
this all you need to do in the either

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.619 
this all you need to do in the either
sort<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.349> begins<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.920> sound<00:03:50.849> like<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> nice

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
sort of begins to sound like a nice

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.679 
sort of begins to sound like a nice
blues<00:03:51.989> guitar<00:03:52.019> solo<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.909> final<00:03:54.569> other

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
blues guitar solo so the final other

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.050 
blues guitar solo so the final other
thing<00:03:54.870> I'll<00:03:54.959> mention<00:03:54.989> here<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.310> make<00:03:56.879> it<00:03:56.909> a

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
thing I'll mention here is to make it a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.789 
thing I'll mention here is to make it a
bit<00:03:57.209> cool<00:03:57.569> sounding<00:03:58.079> by<00:03:58.200> adding<00:03:58.469> in<00:03:58.560> things

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
bit cool sounding by adding in things

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.410 
bit cool sounding by adding in things
like<00:03:58.859> slides<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.849> one<00:03:59.969> of<00:04:00.060> my<00:04:00.150> previous

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
like slides so in one of my previous

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.660 
like slides so in one of my previous
videos<00:04:00.629> I<00:04:01.290> mentioned<00:04:01.709> about<00:04:02.219> how<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.400> can

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
videos I mentioned about how you can

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.330 
videos I mentioned about how you can
slide<00:04:03.030> from<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:04.469> note<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.189> the<00:04:05.219> third

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
slide from this note here on the third

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.000 
slide from this note here on the third
fret<00:04:05.730> which<00:04:05.909> is<00:04:05.939> d<00:04:06.299> after<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.530> T<00:04:07.739> on<00:04:07.769> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
fret which is d after this T on the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.800 
fret which is d after this T on the
fifth<00:04:08.219> fret<00:04:08.310> here<00:04:08.579> on<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.000> second<00:04:09.510> string<00:04:09.629> on

the B string so again so within the e
minor<00:04:12.840> pentatonic<00:04:13.200> scale<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:13.889> also

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
minor pentatonic scale you can also

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770 
minor pentatonic scale you can also
slide<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.549> couple<00:04:14.909> of<00:04:15.000> other<00:04:15.120> spots<00:04:15.450> as<00:04:15.659> well

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:03.279 

it<00:05:00.619> also<00:05:00.999> try<00:05:01.999> repeating<00:05:02.330> some<00:05:02.629> notes<00:05:02.809> as<00:05:03.080> well

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.810 

again<00:05:46.740> how<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:46.950> can<00:05:47.010> just<00:05:47.190> repeat<00:05:47.400> that<00:05:47.580> and

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
again how you can just repeat that and

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.650 
again how you can just repeat that and
it's<00:05:47.970> not<00:05:48.090> you

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
same thing in that string so it's always

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:03.990 
same thing in that string so it's always
in<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:53.730> pattern

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.240 

okay
