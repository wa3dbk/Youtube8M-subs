all<00:00:04.710> right<00:00:04.859> so<00:00:05.040> now<00:00:05.130> we're<00:00:05.310> gonna<00:00:05.370> talk<00:00:05.670> about

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
all right so now we're gonna talk about

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.700 
all right so now we're gonna talk about
how<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.240> keep<00:00:06.629> our<00:00:07.130> fermentation<00:00:09.440> nice<00:00:10.440> and

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
how we keep our fermentation nice and

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.009 
how we keep our fermentation nice and
safe<00:00:11.070> from<00:00:11.250> contamination<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.599> also<00:00:12.840> give

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
safe from contamination but also give

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
safe from contamination but also give
the<00:00:13.139> air<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> place<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.920> escape<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:14.940> as

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the air a place to escape you know as

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.000 
the air a place to escape you know as
the<00:00:15.540> yeast<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.960> even<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> sugars<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.650> giving

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the yeast is even the sugars and giving

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.260 
the yeast is even the sugars and giving
off<00:00:17.160> carbon<00:00:17.730> dioxide<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.470> most<00:00:19.650> common

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
off carbon dioxide so the most common

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.090 
off carbon dioxide so the most common
way<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> by<00:00:21.930> using<00:00:22.080> an<00:00:22.289> airlock<00:00:22.560> so

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
way to do this is by using an airlock so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.230 
way to do this is by using an airlock so
this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> referred<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> three-piece

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this is referred to as a three-piece

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.050 
this is referred to as a three-piece
because<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.410> comes<00:00:25.650> apart<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> see

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
because it comes apart and you see

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.640 
because it comes apart and you see
there's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.689> middle<00:00:27.869> piece<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there's a little middle piece here and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.669 
there's a little middle piece here and
lid<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:30.240> fill<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> line<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.529> with

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
lid you fill it up to a line here with

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.340 
lid you fill it up to a line here with
liquid<00:00:32.070> sanitizing<00:00:32.910> solution<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:34.020> little

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
liquid sanitizing solution this little

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.130 
liquid sanitizing solution this little
Bell<00:00:34.590> thing<00:00:34.860> floats<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.370> there<00:00:35.870> there's<00:00:36.870> air

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Bell thing floats in there there's air

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260 
Bell thing floats in there there's air
holes<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> lid<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
holes in the lid and so this kind of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.840 
holes in the lid and so this kind of
just<00:00:39.440> burbles<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> goes<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
just burbles and goes up and down and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
just burbles and goes up and down and
rattles<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.180> around<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.690> hear<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.050> when

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
rattles and around you can hear it when

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.250 
rattles and around you can hear it when
the<00:00:44.250> co2<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.730> being<00:00:44.910> pushed<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the co2 is being pushed out and how you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
the co2 is being pushed out and how you
form<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.890> tight<00:00:47.160> seal<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> rubber

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
form a tight seal is you use a rubber

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779 
form a tight seal is you use a rubber
stopper<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> it'll<00:00:49.079> plug<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> it's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
stopper like this it'll plug in and it's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
stopper like this it'll plug in and it's
easier<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> warm<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> wet<00:00:52.170> slide

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
easier if you get it warm and wet slide

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
easier if you get it warm and wet slide
it<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.879> form<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> tight

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it in there and this will form a tight

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
it in there and this will form a tight
seal<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.350> carboy<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.760> work<00:00:56.910> with

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
seal and your carboy this will work with

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.150 
seal and your carboy this will work with
glass<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.539> plastic<00:00:57.780> carboys<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.039> sure

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
glass or plastic carboys just make sure

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
glass or plastic carboys just make sure
you<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.640> stopper<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.780> whatever

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you get the right stopper so whatever

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
you get the right stopper so whatever
carboy<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.739> sure<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> look<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
carboy you have make sure you look up

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.830 
carboy you have make sure you look up
and<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:02.730> stopper<00:01:03.120> size<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.480> need<00:01:03.600> for

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and see what stopper size you need for

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.590 
and see what stopper size you need for
example<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> number<00:01:04.890> 10<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.390> think

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
example is the number 10 and I think

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.520 
example is the number 10 and I think
this<00:01:07.549> does<00:01:08.549> fit<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.970> glass<00:01:09.240> carboys<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.320> think

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this does fit my glass carboys I think

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170 
this does fit my glass carboys I think
the<00:01:10.710> plastic<00:01:11.189> carboy<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.700> different<00:01:12.030> size

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the plastic carboy is a different size

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
the plastic carboy is a different size
though<00:01:13.939> also<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.240> glass<00:01:15.390> carboys<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.560> sell

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
though also for glass carboys they sell

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070 
though also for glass carboys they sell
these<00:01:17.130> caps<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:18.000> usually<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> weird<00:01:18.840> color

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
these caps are usually a weird color

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.640 
these caps are usually a weird color
like<00:01:19.229> orange<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> they<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like orange and they have to kind of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
like orange and they have to kind of
seal<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.070> seals<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.640> interior<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.479> don't

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
seal it seals in the interior I don't

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
seal it seals in the interior I don't
have<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.979> I've<00:01:26.250> used

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have the one on here because I've used

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060 
have the one on here because I've used
this<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.420> seal<00:01:27.600> carboys<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> same<00:01:28.619> thing<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this to seal carboys the same thing the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.980 
this to seal carboys the same thing the
airlock<00:01:29.460> plugs<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> hole<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
airlock plugs in here into the hole and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.670 
airlock plugs in here into the hole and
this<00:01:31.409> sits<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.829> top<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> carboy<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:33.780> don't<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
this sits on top the carboy I don't like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
this sits on top the carboy I don't like
these<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.460> can't<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.000> withstand<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
these as much I can't really withstand a

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
these as much I can't really withstand a
whole<00:01:36.600> hour<00:01:36.750> pressure<00:01:37.020> unlike<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
whole hour pressure unlike the the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
whole hour pressure unlike the the
rubber<00:01:38.280> stopper<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.939> take<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> lot<00:01:39.329> more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
rubber stopper can take a lot more

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
rubber stopper can take a lot more
pressure<00:01:39.590> it'll<00:01:40.590> work<00:01:40.710> fine<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
pressure it'll work fine if you have a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.700 
pressure it'll work fine if you have a
pretty<00:01:41.759> tame<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.720> fermentation<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> get

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pretty tame for fermentation if you get

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 
pretty tame for fermentation if you get
a<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.890> crazy<00:01:44.130> yeast<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.060> could<00:01:45.270> definitely

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a really crazy yeast it could definitely

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.330 
a really crazy yeast it could definitely
blow<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.899> cap<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
blow this cap right off and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.480 
blow this cap right off and
yeah<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.420> stuff<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> clean<00:01:48.810> up

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
yeah you have a lot of stuff to clean up

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
yeah you have a lot of stuff to clean up
so<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.720> know<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.079> gonna

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so if you do if you know you're gonna

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
so if you do if you know you're gonna
have<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> crazy<00:01:52.590> fermentation<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.670> had<00:01:53.939> if

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
have a crazy fermentation like we had if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.719 
have a crazy fermentation like we had if
you<00:01:55.049> look<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.530> our<00:01:55.860> end<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.399> burger

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you look at our end to end burger

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
you look at our end to end burger
section<00:01:57.090> look<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> vison<00:01:58.020> bock<00:01:58.200> which<00:01:58.500> was

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
section look at the vison bock which was

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.399 
section look at the vison bock which was
a<00:01:58.680> wild<00:01:59.310> fermentation<00:01:59.520> I<00:02:00.180> use<00:02:01.020> what's<00:02:01.289> called

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
a wild fermentation I use what's called

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
a wild fermentation I use what's called
a<00:02:01.619> blow-off<00:02:01.829> assembly<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
a blow-off assembly so when all that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
a blow-off assembly so when all that
yeast<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.929> just<00:02:04.140> shooting<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> top<00:02:04.830> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
yeast is just shooting out of the top of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370 
yeast is just shooting out of the top of
the<00:02:05.189> fermenter<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.960> bubbles

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the fermenter and the all the bubbles

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.219 
the fermenter and the all the bubbles
and<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> suds<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> everything<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> know

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and the suds and everything and you know

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
and the suds and everything and you know
that's<00:02:10.440> gonna<00:02:10.530> happen<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:11.130> you're<00:02:11.459> using

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that's gonna happen because you're using

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's gonna happen because you're using
something<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:12.480> aggressive<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.140> 1/2<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
something really aggressive like 1/2 of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
something really aggressive like 1/2 of
eyes<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.890> yeast<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.310> lot<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.580> Belgian<00:02:15.030> yeast

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
eyes and yeast a lot of Belgian yeast

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.460 
eyes and yeast a lot of Belgian yeast
will<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.720> especially<00:02:15.959> since<00:02:16.349> they're

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
will do that especially since they're

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.520 
will do that especially since they're
fermented<00:02:16.739> very<00:02:17.130> warm<00:02:17.959> what<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
fermented very warm what I like to do is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.190 
fermented very warm what I like to do is
use<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> blow-off<00:02:20.310> assembly<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.600> you'll<00:02:21.959> take<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
use a blow-off assembly so you'll take a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410 
use a blow-off assembly so you'll take a
growler<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.670> you'll<00:02:23.940> fill<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.330> up

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
growler like this you'll fill it up

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.259 
growler like this you'll fill it up
maybe<00:02:25.200> 2-3<00:02:25.830> inches<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.280> sanitized<00:02:26.760> solution

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
maybe 2-3 inches with sanitized solution

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.270 
maybe 2-3 inches with sanitized solution
of<00:02:28.140> course<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.560> sanitize<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.130> whole

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
of course you want to sanitize the whole

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.720 
of course you want to sanitize the whole
inside<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:30.830> you'll<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> custom<00:02:32.519> rubber

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
inside of it you'll get a custom rubber

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.880 
inside of it you'll get a custom rubber
stopper<00:02:33.299> that's<00:02:33.780> drilled<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.739> want

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
stopper that's drilled out and you want

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
stopper that's drilled out and you want
to<00:02:35.069> have<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.340> drilled<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.780> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
to have it drilled out I don't have this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.220 
to have it drilled out I don't have this
one<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.260> me<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:38.239> this<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:39.900> just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
one on me right now this is I think just

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.140 
one on me right now this is I think just
a<00:02:40.440> probably<00:02:41.010> quarter-inch<00:02:41.370> hole<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.970> need<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
a probably quarter-inch hole you need a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.070 
a probably quarter-inch hole you need a
half-inch<00:02:42.630> hole<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.349> fit<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:45.510> larger<00:02:45.690> hose

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
half-inch hole to fit the larger hose

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
half-inch hole to fit the larger hose
here<00:02:46.349> that'll<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:46.920> there<00:02:47.099> I'm<00:02:47.910> sorry<00:02:48.060> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
here that'll go in there I'm sorry to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.660 
here that'll go in there I'm sorry to
half-inch<00:02:48.599> yes<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.230> haven't<00:02:49.380> Jose<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.519> in

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
half-inch yes I haven't Jose so to go in

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.810 
half-inch yes I haven't Jose so to go in
there<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.090> then<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.620> plugs<00:02:53.130> into<00:02:53.310> your

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
there and then this plugs into your

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.259 
there and then this plugs into your
carboy<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.829> then<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.950> other<00:02:56.220> end<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
carboy and then this other end of the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.830 
carboy and then this other end of the
hose<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.989> stick<00:02:58.320> inside

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680 

out<00:03:01.800> of<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.040> sanitized<00:03:02.519> solution<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.420> let<00:03:03.599> me

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
out of this sanitized solution so let me

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.759 
out of this sanitized solution so let me
get<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.840> around<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.530> see<00:03:04.680> how

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
get this around here and you see how

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.979 
get this around here and you see how
this<00:03:04.890> works<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.580> plugged<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.900> your

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
this works so this is plugged in to your

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.300 
this works so this is plugged in to your
fermenter<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:08.540> then<00:03:09.920> anything<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.069> blows

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
fermenter and then anything that blows

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.850 
fermenter and then anything that blows
out<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.970> end<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.269> going<00:03:12.739> through<00:03:13.739> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
out is going to end up going through the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.979 
out is going to end up going through the
hose<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.430> into<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.150> bottom<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
hose and into the bottom here of the the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.990 
hose and into the bottom here of the the
bluff<00:03:19.170> assembly<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:20.459> know<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.790> use<00:03:20.970> a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
bluff assembly you know I like to use a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.140 
bluff assembly you know I like to use a
growler<00:03:21.330> sixty-four<00:03:21.989> ounces<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.940> you'll<00:03:23.940> see

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
growler sixty-four ounces and you'll see

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.610 
growler sixty-four ounces and you'll see
a<00:03:24.180> lot<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.420> stuff<00:03:24.629> will<00:03:24.810> build<00:03:24.989> up<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.319> it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
a lot of stuff will build up in here it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.330 
a lot of stuff will build up in here it
sometimes<00:03:25.950> even<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.459> will<00:03:26.670> overflow<00:03:28.220> but<00:03:29.220> it

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
sometimes even this will overflow but it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
sometimes even this will overflow but it
works<00:03:29.519> very<00:03:29.700> well<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:31.670> does<00:03:32.670> capture<00:03:33.599> you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
works very well and does capture you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.870 
works very well and does capture you
know<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> lot<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> blow-off<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.340> prevents

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
know a lot of the blow-off and prevents

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.039 
know a lot of the blow-off and prevents
it<00:03:36.000> from<00:03:36.120> falling<00:03:36.420> all<00:03:36.900> over<00:03:37.970> your<00:03:39.049> your

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
it from falling all over your your

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.180

refrigerator your kitchen your bathroom

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.300 
refrigerator your kitchen your bathroom
where<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> fermenting<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.950> also<00:03:43.950> do

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
where you have a fermenting I also do

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.530 
where you have a fermenting I also do
use<00:03:44.670> sometimes<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.420> one-inch<00:03:45.930> hose<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.239> it's<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
use sometimes a one-inch hose so it's a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.750 
use sometimes a one-inch hose so it's a
twice<00:03:49.260> width<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:49.950> it's<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.579> big

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
twice width of this it's a really big

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.170 
twice width of this it's a really big
hose<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:52.019> actually<00:03:52.230> seal<00:03:52.829> tight<00:03:53.220> in

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
hose and it will actually seal tight in

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.569 
hose and it will actually seal tight in
the<00:03:54.329> end<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.629> carboy<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.200> if<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.129> do<00:03:56.340> go<00:03:56.549> to

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
the end of a carboy and if you do go to

the intent brews section you'll see the
fermentation<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:02.640> how<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.420> hooked<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.959> up<00:04:04.019> in

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
fermentation of how I hooked that up in

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.280 
fermentation of how I hooked that up in
fact<00:04:04.470> I'll<00:04:04.650> link<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.840> I'll<00:04:06.840> link<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.200> that

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
fact I'll link to that I'll link to that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.289

video<00:04:07.530> below<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.130> video<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:08.940> guys<00:04:09.030> can

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
video below this video so you guys can

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.819 
video below this video so you guys can
see<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.600> action<00:04:09.989> see<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.440> blow-off

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
see in action see how the blow-off

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.740 
see in action see how the blow-off
assembly<00:04:11.370> works<00:04:11.579> because<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.359> was<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.480> really

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
assembly works because that was a really

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.620 
assembly works because that was a really
really<00:04:13.079> crazy<00:04:13.230> fermentation<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.269> hope

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
really crazy fermentation so I hope

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.779 
really crazy fermentation so I hope
that's<00:04:15.840> answer<00:04:16.289> some<00:04:16.440> questions<00:04:16.919> again<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
that's answer some questions again you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.479 
that's answer some questions again you
need<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.599> form<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.139> an<00:04:19.829> airlock<00:04:20.160> on

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
need to have some form of an airlock on

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.129 
need to have some form of an airlock on
there<00:04:20.729> or<00:04:20.880> blow-off<00:04:21.090> assembly<00:04:21.630> when<00:04:22.019> you

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
there or blow-off assembly when you

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.839 
there or blow-off assembly when you
ferment<00:04:23.360> just<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.450> keep<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.810> bacteria<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
ferment just to keep the bacteria and

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.040 
ferment just to keep the bacteria and
airborne<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:26.970> east<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.300> wild<00:04:27.690> yeast<00:04:27.870> and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
airborne the east and wild yeast and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.200 
airborne the east and wild yeast and
things<00:04:28.229> like<00:04:28.349> that<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.710> your<00:04:28.830> brew<00:04:29.210> right

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
things like that out of your brew right

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.470 
things like that out of your brew right
so<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.419> any<00:04:30.479> questions<00:04:30.900> just<00:04:31.080> leave<00:04:31.229> below
