00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
everybody we go through some periods of

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.100 
everybody we go through some periods of
despair<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.640> know<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:34.090> which<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.660> feel

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
despair you know in which you you feel

despair you know in which you you feel
none<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.950> Ryan<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.550> you're<00:02:36.700> you're

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
none like Ryan that you're you're

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.990 
none like Ryan that you're you're
floating<00:02:37.660> into<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.140> boys<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.670> know<00:02:39.700> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
floating into the boys you know and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.990 
floating into the boys you know and
you're<00:02:40.480> losing<00:02:40.780> completely<00:02:41.470> any<00:02:42.430> sense<00:02:42.790> of

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
you're losing completely any sense of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.979 
you're losing completely any sense of
ground<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> problem<00:02:45.099> is<00:02:45.250> also<00:02:45.459> that

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
ground and the problem is also that

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.809 
ground and the problem is also that
we're<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.019> victim<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.560> our<00:02:47.650> our<00:02:48.220> own<00:02:48.489> inertia

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
we're a victim of our our own inertia

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.740 
we're a victim of our our own inertia
you<00:02:49.300> know<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.260> space<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.750> physical

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you know in the space is the physical

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.199 
you know in the space is the physical
inertia<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:53.860> urges<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.550> were<00:02:54.849> our

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
inertia but in urges that were our

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.570 
inertia but in urges that were our
tendencies<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.170> know<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:56.800> we<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.489> an

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
tendencies you know that we we have an

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.030 
tendencies you know that we we have an
inertia<00:02:57.850> how<00:02:58.269> we<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.510> things<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.410> we<00:02:59.769> have<00:02:59.920> to

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
inertia how we do things and we have to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.370 
inertia how we do things and we have to
learn<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.370> change<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.940> inertia<00:03:01.239> if<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.140> want

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
learn to change that inertia if we want

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.880 
learn to change that inertia if we want
what<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:03.580> want<00:03:03.790> any<00:03:04.030> change<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
what if we want any change so what is it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.740 
what if we want any change so what is it
that<00:03:06.130> keeps<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.360> keeps<00:03:07.600> you

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
that keeps you going that keeps you

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.840 
that keeps you going that keeps you
motivated<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.680> think<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.190> same<00:03:09.370> thing<00:03:09.700> that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
motivated I think is the same thing that

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.050 
motivated I think is the same thing that
he<00:03:10.030> keeps<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:11.620> Rhinestone<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.790> film

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
he keeps going Rhinestone in the film

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.910 
he keeps going Rhinestone in the film
that<00:03:13.269> even<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.630> using<00:03:13.959> complete<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.470> spirit

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
that even if using complete the spirit

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.120 
that even if using complete the spirit
is<00:03:15.120> be<00:03:16.120> an<00:03:16.330> impulse<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.900> even<00:03:17.319> stronger

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
is be an impulse that is even stronger

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.330 
is be an impulse that is even stronger
that<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.030> impulse<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.870> life<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.530> that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
that is that impulse of life and that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.789 
that is that impulse of life and that
simples<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.030> well<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.870> think<00:03:22.989> keeps<00:03:23.380> me<00:03:23.560> going

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
simples is well I think keeps me going

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.229 
simples is well I think keeps me going
but<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> impulse<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.000> keeps

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
but I think is the impulse that keeps

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.809 
but I think is the impulse that keeps
everybody<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:26.019> thank<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.340> much<00:03:27.549> and
