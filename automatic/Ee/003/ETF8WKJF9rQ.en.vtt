00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the game was convincing people it was a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
the game was convincing people it was a
good<00:02:22.740> idea<00:02:22.770> that's<00:02:23.430> nearly<00:02:23.670> 20<00:02:24.060> years<00:02:24.090> old<00:02:24.480> was

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
good idea that's nearly 20 years old was

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260 
good idea that's nearly 20 years old was
256<00:02:25.620> colors<00:02:25.830> when<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.580> were<00:02:26.700> doing<00:02:26.850> things

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
like yell and I think at its height it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.950 
like yell and I think at its height it
was<00:02:29.490> like<00:02:29.670> five<00:02:29.970> people<00:02:30.420> working<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
thing we didn't have storyboards it had

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
thing we didn't have storyboards it had
to<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:32.970> built<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.600> whole<00:02:33.780> CGI<00:02:34.320> machines<00:02:34.860> had

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
us the game started with a

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.339 
us the game started with a
point-and-click<00:05:03.449> interface<00:05:03.599> with<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.139> mouse

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
point-and-click interface with the mouse

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.170 
point-and-click interface with the mouse
and<00:05:04.560> making<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.400> something<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.879> people

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
and making it something that people

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.240 
and making it something that people
could<00:05:06.330> play<00:05:06.539> on<00:05:06.870> controller<00:05:07.530> was<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.069> biggest

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
could play on controller was the biggest

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.800 
could play on controller was the biggest
challenge<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:09.000> interface<00:05:09.270> filled<00:05:09.569> almost

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
challenge the interface filled almost

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.600 
challenge the interface filled almost
half<00:05:10.139> of<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.379> screen<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:11.039> we<00:05:11.069> removed<00:05:11.430> that

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
half of the screen so we removed that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.249 
half of the screen so we removed that
and<00:05:12.030> put<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.509> background<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.110> would

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
and put it in the background so it would

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:14.719 
and put it in the background so it would
work<00:05:13.409> well<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.680> any<00:05:13.979> platform<00:05:14.219> we<00:05:14.550> just

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
work well on any platform we just

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.369 
work well on any platform we just
couldn't<00:05:14.969> say<00:05:15.120> no<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.330> anything<00:05:15.719> like<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.229> it's

couldn't say no to anything like if it's
cool<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.889> then<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.189> game<00:05:17.340> deserves<00:05:17.639> a<00:05:17.879> tweeze

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
cool and then the game deserves a tweeze

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.240 
cool and then the game deserves a tweeze
like<00:05:18.389> it's<00:05:18.780> got<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.080> go<00:05:19.199> in<00:05:19.379> i'm<00:05:19.620> gonna<00:05:19.800> put<00:05:20.099> you

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
breath we didn't want people to have to

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.110 
breath we didn't want people to have to
break<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.740> experience<00:05:32.189> so<00:05:32.310> we<00:05:32.639> created<00:05:32.939> a

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
break the experience so we created a

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.820 
break the experience so we created a
hint<00:05:33.300> system<00:05:33.419> integrated<00:05:33.990> directly<00:05:34.229> into<00:05:34.560> the

hint system integrated directly into the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.200
