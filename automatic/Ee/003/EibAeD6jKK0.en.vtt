00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello doctor itard surgeons 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.570
 dentists settled in paris in the 2nd 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.519
 borough 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.840
 I will explain today what 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.089
 what are bone grafts 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 it's especially since the use of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.199
 dental implants that have been brought 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
 to perform bone grafts 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.539
 first small reminder the implants 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 must be put in a place that 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 sufficient in the three dimensions of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.340
 space 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.240
 if there is a deficit at this it is at 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.679
 to say a man 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 insufficient to be able to ask others 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.950
 implants we will have to look for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 means to restore this deficit is the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 bone graft the bone graft its 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.350
 origin and the techniques used to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.989
 its implementation will be different 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 according to the indications so more 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 just if I need them for 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.329
 rebuild maxillary the question will be 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.910
 or go get it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.100
 and how to put it to answer it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.530
 be aware that there are four major 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 possible original types for this plugin 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.610
 first of all the graft can come from 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.979
 this is called the bone 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 autolog the dentist can 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.670
 take for example in the mouth a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.360
 to bone bell at the symphysis 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.090
 chin rest sometimes when needs 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 of reconstruction are important 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 can look for much more sources 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 wide of honor and there it will be a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.080
 maxillofacial surgeon who will take 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 bone fragments in the skull 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.950
 the graft to this can be too 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.220
 of synthetic origin of the avantagent 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 the bone 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 autolog special bone that comes from me 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 same and which allows to rebuild 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 important bone deficits is that it is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.229
 perfectly god compatible though 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.020
 progress in bioengineering has 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.090
 so allowed the synthesis of these materials 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.920
 synthetic or animal origin 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.390
 provide services also very 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 important in the field of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.290
 reconstruction 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.119
 in any case the material will serve 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.630
 of frame on which our cells 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 bone 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.920
 you make a new structure 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 mineral this process takes about five 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.720
 at six months 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.550
 bone grafting processes 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 may hesitate to use 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.580
 membranes that will keep away the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.030
 cells different from the cells 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 bone 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 for example epithelial cells 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.210
 conjunctive bone grafts 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.340
 so allow to put implants 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.410
 even when the initial conditions 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.460
 are unfavorable and improve the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.380
 aesthetic conditions 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.710
 now you know what are the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.710
 bone grafts
