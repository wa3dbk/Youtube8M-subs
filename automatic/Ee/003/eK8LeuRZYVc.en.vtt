00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the counter and we figured they were

going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.129> he<00:00:56.850> knew

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
going to do that and I think he knew

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
going to do that and I think he knew
that<00:00:57.059> he<00:00:57.329> could<00:00:57.480> frustrate<00:00:57.690> us<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.289> bit

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that he could frustrate us a little bit

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.750 
that he could frustrate us a little bit
and<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.739> did<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> great<00:00:59.070> job<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> tonight

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and they did a great job of that tonight

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
and they did a great job of that tonight
so<00:00:59.879> I'll<00:01:00.000> give<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> credit<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> to

kind<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> thing<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.450> made<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.840> great

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
kind of thing and so it made for great

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
kind of thing and so it made for great
highlights<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.619> sure<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.799> everybody<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.610> we

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
highlights I'm sure for everybody but we

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
away a little bit earlier I think this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
away a little bit earlier I think this
