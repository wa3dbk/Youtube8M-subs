00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.869
 I hope he looks good and very happy 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.029
 with this game I'm going to present is a 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.460
 game that I already uploaded an earlier version 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.820
 of the year the game is that of the letter to 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 famous number here and this letter the number 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.210
 I recently learned it from a good friend 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.680
 recipe sergio and I liked it so much that I've 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.250
 decided to make an accomplishment to me 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.230
 way and upload it and then well then you 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.570
 I will put the link to rate it explained 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.179
 we go first for the realization and given 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.760
 here we have a deck completely 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.269
 mixed 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 and we're going to give it to a viewer to 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.760
 that the cut more or less in half 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.519
 more or less that is the exact half 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.879
 and of the half of remains that choose a 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.879
 cake 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.650
 imagine imagining what you choose these 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 seven ethics the magician should not have 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.540
 but as I do not have any viewer 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.640
 well then 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.610
 but let's cut more or less by the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.520
 half we're going to lose we're going to 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.409
 complete and the letter is there allowed 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.329
 we leave it 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.979
 we go back to the first pile that we cut and 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.500
 we tell you about it this is very 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.329
 simple is a game we had said art 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.060
 of letter the number then I'll 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.850
 start distributing letters 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 when the viewer wants me 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.710
 stop where he wants to freely 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.740
 imagined that says vale 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.929
 in this party at this stage that you have 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.340
 in my hand with the one in my hand 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.479
 is number is the letter 10 of the clover but 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.490
 as it is a letter the number goes 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.159
 exactly the same color was 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.019
 exactly the same as the figure of punk da 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.599
 so what we care about is the 10 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:15.340
 look if you had stopped a letter 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:18.670
 then it would have chosen or had 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.040
 come out one jot that in this case for the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 I do not know what he explained in the jota is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 the one that goes from 10 and its value 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 numerical is or not in most game 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.600
 then see a 10 would be an 11 then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.140
 I would totally change 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.010
 the game if I had chosen had to 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.650
 a previous one would have grown a 5 with 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 which also would have changed a lot 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 game let's see if it went well 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.370
 we leave the letters there are their 10 and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.730
 let's take the letters where 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.790
 freely chose and lost his letter not 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.280
 and lost we do not know where it is but if 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.260
 he has had good intuition when stopping 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.459
 in position number 10 will be your letter 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.739
 because if I had chosen a before or a 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.390
 then without another number that we had 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.680
 seen that it had happened 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.680
 then let's count a 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.960
 3. 4. 5 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:30.550
 7 8 9 and letter number 10 if you really 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.610
 has had good intuition will be 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.530
 effectively your chosen letter can you 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.380
 we can continue to draw letters so that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.470
 see that there is no 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.550
 there are no repeated letters there is no 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.840
 order there is absolutely nothing more than 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.550
 letters 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.190
 so I want to show that the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.010
 spectator has got 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.050
 find a lost letter with your 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.970
 own intuition and the own deck 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.210
 good if you liked this game that 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.940
 I hope that if you liked it as much as 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.030
 I'm going to leave the links 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.580
 relevant 1 to the direct channel of sergio 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.330
 but with subscribe is also very good 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.120
 and another direct link to the revelation 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.970
 the body so that it may learn the same 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.200
 I hope you like it and even the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.200
 next game chao
