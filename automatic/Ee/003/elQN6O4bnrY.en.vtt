00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
though if they had removed these two

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.390 
though if they had removed these two
inner<00:01:35.290> plates<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.040> moved<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:37.630> over<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
cut I think it would look a thousand

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780 
cut I think it would look a thousand
times<00:01:44.170> better<00:01:44.410> this<00:01:45.009> is<00:01:45.100> really<00:01:45.340> heavy

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790
