00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 very good I am said galilea 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.220
 turn around and my car 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.680
 room 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.809
 and the fucking identity the 10 but that 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.309
 I'm going to talk about typical errors of 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.719
 photography and as soon as we finish by 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.269
 please organize what looks like a 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.769
 sewers was reviewing my 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.599
 first pictures and I've noticed 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.759
 that there were a series of errors that 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.679
 I was committing continuously so I decided 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.329
 share it with you so that you do not 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.369
 comet jce one needless to say that 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.829
 I'm still making mistakes and one of them 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.710
 is to review all our equipment before 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.750
 go out to our session check the camera 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.490
 check the batteries that are charged 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.220
 memory cards that have 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.110
 space carries batteries as much as you can 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.050
 happen hand because it's going to happen so 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.550
 go ahead and check and check 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.110
 well all your equipment before going to the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.480
 photo session the first error that 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.490
 committed was to place in the center of the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.760
 composition to the protagonist of the image 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.440
 and this is a mistake because good if not 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.950
 let's make a symmetrical composition 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.089
 It is not recommended to place 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.119
 our point of interest in our 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.140
 character in the center of the composition 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.210
 remember that there is the rule of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.980
 thirds in which you can place in the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 strengths or points 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.510
 of those lines the characters are the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.520
 protagonists of this image so that you 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.040
 photography win force another mistake that 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.440
 What I did was that I did not approach anything 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.600
 things then I discovered how pretty they were 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.030
 the first close-ups but 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.590
 what's up you can discover them and point 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.710
 all day long make first first 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.840
 grains care is sometimes better to leave a 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.430
 little bit of air a little bit of space 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.710
 around for example our first 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.570
 flat for then in the editing phase 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.000
 to be able to get a little closer to him than 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.490
 from the take and have a very first 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 close-up and not being able to get away because 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.840
 imagine that we have cut the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.060
 ears we have cut some cut in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.520
 the image that is ugly is better sometimes 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.290
 sin to leave a little more air 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.600
 that gives us all the opposites of 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.120
 approach us very much our subject and the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.040
 third mistake I had was to trust me 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.870
 subway husband who has the camera this 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.940
 it's not entirely wrong it helps us 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.320
 be more or less oriented but not 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.560
 you must forget that it is an exposure meter 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.390
 works for a medium gray that is to say the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.420
 camera is telling you that the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.340
 exposure is correct or not if 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.910
 I was measuring a medium gray and in 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.500
 very very few times we measure a gray 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.090
 medium or a trick for example for when 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.670
 you are doing urban photography by 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.830
 example is the view on sidewalks 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.630
 sidewalks are usually a gray more or less 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.550
 so a trick that I can give you is what 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.870
 measurements are there to check if the light 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.030
 it is correct in your photograph 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.100
 although as I tell you one of my mistakes 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.380
 I was fixing a lot very much 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.209
 very much later and subway with time 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.770
 you will realize that it will be worth much more 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.720
 your criteria than what the camera says 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.610
 another mistake that he also made was not 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800
 pay too much attention to the approach and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.959
 this is fundamental an out of focus photo 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.480
 it's not worth anything to us and you can tell it's 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.950
 defocused you have to focus on the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.930
 point of interest for example in the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.090
 people what is the point of interest 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.830
 eyes the focus within a portrait 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.910
 always have to be in the eye to not 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.280
 be that we want to draw attention 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.870
 about something else normal has always 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.370
 to be in the eyes 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.349
 very curious mistake of my first 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.000
 photographs that I have seen is that it was not 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.920
 able to simplify things always 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.780
 they told me many and many many things 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.970
 of the composition it is sometimes better 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.129
 simplify and go straight to the grain 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.140
 to start loading our image of 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.269
 things and in this way what we get 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.680
 is to mislead the viewer and the last 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.540
 error that discovered in my first 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.190
 photographs although surely not so 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.069
 It is the last but it would have many more 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.799
 It is not sought to adduce elements 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.390
 in depth to capture the three 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.560
 dimensions within our photography 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.709
 is not to say did not leave the 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.049
 Two-dimensional search for located objects 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.180
 behind you can with the light with the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.129
 blurs to get the effect of 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.329
 the third dimension I think is a 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.280
 fundamental part of our 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.079
 photographs now I await your comments 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.970
 with the mistakes you see in your first 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.769
 photographs or old photographs of 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.510
 this way we will learn among all 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.489
 do not forget to leave your I like to add it to 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.170
 favorites you know that if you share what 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.099
 parties a greeting and see you next 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.099
 goodbye video
