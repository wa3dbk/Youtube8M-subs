00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.149 
equal to a number of swamps I control
and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.459> actually<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:45.000> six<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.750> mana<00:01:46.200> my

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and I actually have six in my mana my

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.779 
and I actually have six in my mana my
land<00:01:47.429> pool<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.719> he's<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.109> six<00:01:49.619> six<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
land pool so he's actually six six so

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.270 
land pool so he's actually six six so
you<00:01:50.880> subtract<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> six<00:01:51.689> from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.899> 11<00:01:52.439> because

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you subtract the six from the 11 because

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.039

take five life but this one also has a
regeneration<00:01:58.530> ability<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.759> actually

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
regeneration ability so I can actually

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.699
