00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 We want to pan am and today I came to talk about the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
 book glass girls of laurie house 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.030
 Anderson is for everyone who says that I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 there is bullshit bite the tongue 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.889
 The book was launched in 2012 by the new 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 concept but only this year that I went to read 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.920
 a lot of people had already recommended 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.690
 I think it was very good and I only saw 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 When he came to Brazil, I did not give 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.580
 too much ball for some reason for hair 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 Reading the book speaks of the same author before 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.039
 of laws here every time I spoke was 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 released later but I should have gone one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 this book not before because in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.040
 another time it would be more important 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 but the book was so good for that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.629
 I should have given it a try before 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.309
 book will tell the story of the estuary that is 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 a young girl who is in education 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 average she had a best friend only 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.200
 the two stopped to talk some 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 time and she receives the news that this 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.489
 her friend's mother was found dead 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.399
 in a motel motel in the case of the states 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 does not have this meaning that I 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.579
 I 'm afraid she was found dead. 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.769
 there is not talk cause the attention and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.250
 Suicide for things are raised 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 but what she knows is that her friend 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 I had tried to call her several and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 several times she did not have 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.080
 attended there is so large that her father 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 with a grace that was a decision that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.939
 he took her family took after 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.610
 that she was hospitalized because of 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.970
 obsession of a thinness for the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
 case of bulimia and anorexia that she has is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 something she shared with this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.970
 She's her best friend then everyone. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 As soon as we get everyone gets 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.290
 fear that he would fall into this again and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.049
 Whether she wants to or not, she is still 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.220
 some problems that other people 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 they do not look so sidelined because 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.140
 she tries her best to hide only that she 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 you have this problem and during the book 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.930
 We are going to enter this life of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 how she was like him like her 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 entered this world as if it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.490
 her feeling of being a bad thing 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.410
 Why are you eating and all? 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 the calories and why it feels dirty 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.000
 Why are you eating certain food? 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.670
 and all the contradictions she wants 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.020
 eat to know what is good but the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.540
 same time she knows that it will 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.160
 doing will do harm to the body gives 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.340
 one thought that this will do harm to the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 her body and stays the whole time 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 discussion in her head we will 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.730
 knowing what the relationship was like 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.000
 With that, the former best friend 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 It's how the two got in like the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.239
 her parents saw this problem from her 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.180
 and how it is seen by parents of the best 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.220
 her friend as she walked away and has 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.370
 A reason for this character, yes, certainly not. 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 involvement in the death of her friend 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.040
 there is a reason that we will 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.519
 meet there in the middle of the book 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.370
 kind of relationship she had with this friend 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.640
 what kind of relationship to the bastion with this 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.880
 with this bulimia anorexia beyond 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.750
 eating disorders is also what 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.200
 will talk about the suicide attempt 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 and if you cut and the book is very heavy 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.959
 I even mentioned it in the book about 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 marathon I said that it was difficult was 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.980
 a book that is difficult to swallow 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 It was intentional, it's even 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.450
 my attention in the comments on the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.519
 time dispensed in this way and the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.470
 book dealt with eating disorders 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.109
 it was not my intention to do any 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.720
 It's a pun thing, but the 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.989
 how the area is describing the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.780
 situation as she sees her situation 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.670
 with a view of others seeing the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.310
 with her tells it seems that I 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.829
 I can feel everything, and I know it. 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 Oh what an agony that is to live this way and 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.639
 damn go after help know and 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.489
 including in the book is cited a species 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:07.150
 group that she finds on the internet 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.130
 people who have the same problem and how 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.260
 they help to deepen this 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.440
 problem knows us and is very sad 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.079
 this is serious is a thing with the one thing 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.609
 very very very very sad very 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.129
 Sometimes the kind of people who 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.490
 consciously or even to the 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:27.469
 media as short as this stimulates 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.409
 problem and especially in girls, right? 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:32.960
 she still tells that like the girls 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.379
 they were envious of her body to be 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.020
 so thin and the men to the boys and 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.509
 they came as a dead woman knows then 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.349
 sometimes we put things in our 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.569
 head that does not make sense knows that only 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.639
 is going to hurt even more ourselves is 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.439
 one of the books that I highly recommend 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.909
 be read by adolescents not only 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.580
 by adolescents but also by the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.710
 older people to understand aa 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.069
 head who goes through it and 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.169
 understand that I play whenever 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.439
 way they are going through that they can 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.360
 one day you will think about starting to have 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.659
 an eating disorder to see the vision 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.509
 that other people have know is even a 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.460
 thing that is misrepresented to the 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.250
 Do you have with your body and how do you? 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.110
 sees your body often does not 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.669
 I sense the super book 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.370
 important to read at this time 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.099
 especially there elementary school and 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.449
 middle that's where there are girls 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:36.560
 mainly begin to compare the 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.469
 other girls and find that your body 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.210
 no, it's not good enough and it's not 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.490
 we want to change in some way and 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.319
 Sometimes it is not necessary to know whether to 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.259
 Grow up, you'll see when you grow up. 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.449
 always know that I was dumb I to 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.699
 sometimes I had 9 hours very much 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.250
 bizarre accident when he was younger and 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:58.879
 today they have introduced miss ko2 to someone else 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.520
 It's just the way I am, I'm not going anymore. 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.710
 but a good part of my body and if it continues 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.740
 Just like I have a head 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.900
 different I think different and I am 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.240
 much more confident than I was night 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.740
 and that's all that changed know the trust 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.870
 that the person has then is a book that 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.689
 I highly recommend it was 5 stars 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.189
 recommended very very very same 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.050
 recommends the other book of the 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:23.719
 author, I will make it clear here that the 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.979
 Book talk that you're going to talk about speech. 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.319
