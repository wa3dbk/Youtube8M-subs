00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
okay so last time we talked about our

okay so last time we talked about our
new<00:00:46.480> series<00:00:46.810> of<00:00:47.080> fodders<00:00:47.440> called<00:00:47.800> the<00:00:47.980> fog

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
new series of fodders called the fog

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.660 
new series of fodders called the fog
theory<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:48.790> had<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.150> 1000<00:00:50.020> 2000<00:00:50.740> 3000<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:51.550> the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
theory we had the 1000 2000 3000 in the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.770 
theory we had the 1000 2000 3000 in the
3000<00:00:52.510> why<00:00:52.660> fly<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:55.090> actually<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.660> little

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
3000 why fly this is actually a little

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.010 
3000 why fly this is actually a little
bit<00:00:55.870> different<00:00:56.380> this<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:57.460> phaser<00:00:58.240> now

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
bit different this is a phaser now

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.160 
bit different this is a phaser now
what's<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.740> phaser<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.850> know<00:01:00.970> somewhat<00:01:01.750> the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
what's a phaser you know somewhat the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
what's a phaser you know somewhat the
effect<00:01:02.470> you'd<00:01:02.680> get<00:01:02.920> with<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.100> oil-based<00:01:04.059> heiser

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
effect you'd get with a oil-based heiser

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.230 
effect you'd get with a oil-based heiser
but<00:01:05.230> you're<00:01:05.440> using<00:01:05.620> a<00:01:05.830> water-based<00:01:06.430> fog<00:01:06.910> fluid

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
but you're using a water-based fog fluid

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.240 
but you're using a water-based fog fluid
and<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:08.050> going<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.290> give<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> little<00:01:08.980> bit

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and it's going to give you a little bit

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.900 
and it's going to give you a little bit
more<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.880> wider<00:01:11.160> atmospheric<00:01:12.160> surface<00:01:12.670> than

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
more of a wider atmospheric surface than

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.960 
more of a wider atmospheric surface than
say<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.650> oil-based<00:01:14.650> haze<00:01:14.860> machine<00:01:15.310> oil-based

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
say a oil-based haze machine oil-based

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.900 
say a oil-based haze machine oil-based
haze<00:01:16.150> machine<00:01:16.570> works<00:01:16.840> by<00:01:17.110> shaking<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.880> know

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
haze machine works by shaking you know

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.780 
haze machine works by shaking you know
mineral<00:01:19.390> oil<00:01:19.600> based<00:01:19.690> fluid<00:01:20.320> at<00:01:20.950> an<00:01:21.190> ultrasonic

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
mineral oil based fluid at an ultrasonic

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.240 
mineral oil based fluid at an ultrasonic
rate<00:01:22.080> distributing<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.170> into<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.470> air<00:01:23.650> well

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
rate distributing it into the air well

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.100 
rate distributing it into the air well
this<00:01:24.430> works<00:01:24.729> like<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> traditional<00:01:25.810> fog

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
this works like a traditional fog

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.040 
this works like a traditional fog
machine<00:01:26.610> except<00:01:27.610> and<00:01:27.940> you'll<00:01:28.450> see<00:01:28.660> inside

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
machine except and you'll see inside

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.630 
machine except and you'll see inside
there's<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.590> different<00:01:29.920> trick<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.310> kind<00:01:30.520> of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
there's a different trick to kind of

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.060 
there's a different trick to kind of
spread<00:01:30.940> it<00:01:31.090> out<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.510> make<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.990> little<00:01:32.260> hazy

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
spread it out and make it a little hazy

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.550 
spread it out and make it a little hazy
err<00:01:33.479> okay<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.690> just<00:01:34.990> powered<00:01:35.290> up<00:01:35.440> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
err okay so I just powered up the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.650 
err okay so I just powered up the
machine<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.070> before<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.479> void<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> warranty

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
machine and before I void the warranty

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.230 
machine and before I void the warranty
on<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.380> like<00:01:38.800> usual<00:01:39.070> I'm<00:01:39.670> going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.880> take<00:01:40.060> you

connection like I said a moment ago we
have<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.400> tank<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.700> actually<00:02:40.209> lights<00:02:40.930> up<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
have a tank that actually lights up to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.260 
have a tank that actually lights up to
kind<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> let<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.490> know<00:02:42.670> when<00:02:42.819> you're<00:02:42.940> running

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
kind of let you know when you're running

kind of let you know when you're running
low<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.450> fluid<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.980> good<00:02:45.550> sized<00:02:45.790> 2<00:02:46.120> liter

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
low on fluid it's a good sized 2 liter

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.760 
low on fluid it's a good sized 2 liter
tank<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.959> you'll<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.410> some<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
tank like you'll see on some of the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
tank like you'll see on some of the
other<00:02:47.920> bog<00:02:48.640> fury<00:02:48.970> series

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.649 

as<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.099> see<00:02:56.280> now<00:02:56.519> it's<00:02:56.730> shooting<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.599> a

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
as you can see now it's shooting out a

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.759 
as you can see now it's shooting out a
diffused<00:02:58.590> atmospheric<00:02:59.580> versus<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> big<00:03:00.769> milky

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
diffused atmospheric versus a big milky

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.039 
diffused atmospheric versus a big milky
white<00:03:02.040> cloud<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.580> get<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.940> regular<00:03:03.569> fog

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
white cloud you get with a regular fog

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.339 
white cloud you get with a regular fog
machine<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> lot<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> times<00:03:05.970> for

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
machine you know so a lot of times for

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.100 
machine you know so a lot of times for
theatrical<00:03:07.349> applications<00:03:08.250> or<00:03:08.670> large<00:03:09.450> venues

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
theatrical applications or large venues

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.160 
theatrical applications or large venues
where<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.560> don't<00:03:10.799> want<00:03:11.010> just<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.400> big<00:03:11.580> cloud

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
where you don't want just the big cloud

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.710 
where you don't want just the big cloud
this<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.230> where<00:03:13.530> faze<00:03:13.769> comes<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.280> handy<00:03:14.720> all

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
this is where faze comes in handy all

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:26.490 
this is where faze comes in handy all
right<00:03:15.870> well<00:03:16.310> let's<00:03:17.310> take<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.580> apart

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.350 

all<00:03:27.100> right<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.490> this<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.700> actually<00:03:28.000> pretty

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
all right so this is actually pretty

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.630 
all right so this is actually pretty
easy<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.810> got<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.200> side<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.800> unit<00:03:30.070> off<00:03:30.220> here

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
easy I got the side of the unit off here

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.570 
easy I got the side of the unit off here
go<00:03:31.240> ahead<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.480> unplug<00:03:31.720> ground<00:03:32.440> from<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.070> side

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
go ahead and unplug ground from the side

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.090 
go ahead and unplug ground from the side
piece<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.290> pretty<00:03:38.290> much<00:03:38.530> looks<00:03:38.740> like<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
piece and so pretty much looks like the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.490 
piece and so pretty much looks like the
the<00:03:39.610> same<00:03:39.820> thing<00:03:40.060> as<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> regular<00:03:40.420> fog<00:03:41.050> machine

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the same thing as a regular fog machine

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.410 
the same thing as a regular fog machine
just<00:03:41.770> rearranged<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.670> little<00:03:42.880> bit<00:03:43.000> differently

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
just rearranged a little bit differently

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.290 
just rearranged a little bit differently
so<00:03:44.110> back<00:03:44.920> here<00:03:45.190> you've<00:03:45.340> got<00:03:45.490> your<00:03:45.520> main<00:03:45.820> PC

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
so back here you've got your main PC

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.470 
so back here you've got your main PC
board<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.780> got<00:03:46.870> your<00:03:47.080> power<00:03:47.260> supply<00:03:48.480> back

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
board you got your power supply back

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.800 
board you got your power supply back
here<00:03:49.870> you've<00:03:50.260> got<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:50.860> pump<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.790> takes<00:03:52.570> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
here you've got your pump that takes the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.230 
here you've got your pump that takes the
fog<00:03:53.440> fluid<00:03:53.680> from<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.070> tank<00:03:54.490> in<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.700> reservoir

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
fog fluid from the tank in the reservoir

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.300 
fog fluid from the tank in the reservoir
through<00:03:55.990> this<00:03:56.140> little<00:03:56.440> brass<00:03:56.650> fitting<00:03:57.100> into

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
through this little brass fitting into

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.360 
through this little brass fitting into
the<00:03:57.520> pump<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.030> then<00:03:58.630> into<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.350> the<00:04:00.130> heater

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the pump and then into the the heater

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.479 
the pump and then into the the heater
core<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.600> out<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.930> pump<00:04:02.170> we<00:04:03.010> go<00:04:03.160> into<00:04:03.310> this

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
core so out of the pump we go into this

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.729 
core so out of the pump we go into this
heater<00:04:03.790> core<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.330> this<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> 700<00:04:05.560> watt

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
heater core and this is a 700 watt

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.979 
heater core and this is a 700 watt
heater<00:04:06.459> core<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.030> get<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.239> good<00:04:07.630> amount<00:04:07.930> of

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
heater core so you get a good amount of

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.590 
heater core so you get a good amount of
fog<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> can't<00:04:10.720> really<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:11.230> but<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:12.600> don't

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
fog and you can't really see but I don't

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.720 
fog and you can't really see but I don't
know<00:04:13.690> if<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.870> can<00:04:14.050> see<00:04:14.260> in<00:04:14.410> here<00:04:14.860> there's<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
know if we can see in here there's the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.650 
know if we can see in here there's the
nozzle<00:04:16.209> now<00:04:16.450> don't<00:04:16.750> touch<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.230> it's<00:04:17.739> hot<00:04:18.660> so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
nozzle now don't touch that it's hot so

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.560 
nozzle now don't touch that it's hot so
anyway<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.140> fog<00:04:20.350> comes<00:04:20.709> out<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.040> there<00:04:21.570> but

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
anyway the fog comes out of there but

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.260 
anyway the fog comes out of there but
the<00:04:23.230> actual<00:04:23.530> magic<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.280> machine<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.030> this

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
the actual magic of this machine is this

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.360 
the actual magic of this machine is this
really<00:04:25.690> cool<00:04:25.900> high-quality<00:04:26.710> squirrel<00:04:27.040> family

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
really cool high-quality squirrel family

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.990 
really cool high-quality squirrel family
got<00:04:27.850> right<00:04:28.090> here<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:29.310> helps<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:30.550> diffuse

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
got right here that helps just diffuse

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.550 
got right here that helps just diffuse
the<00:04:31.180> fog<00:04:31.390> when<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.690> comes<00:04:31.900> out<00:04:32.140> of<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.350> front

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the fog when it comes out of the front

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.800 
the fog when it comes out of the front
and<00:04:32.860> you'll<00:04:32.979> see<00:04:33.160> also<00:04:33.490> it's<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.330> little<00:04:34.540> grate

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and you'll see also it's a little grate

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.409 
and you'll see also it's a little grate
that's<00:04:35.530> where<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.860> air<00:04:36.640> from<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.180> squirrel

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
that's where the air from the squirrel

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.990 
that's where the air from the squirrel
fan<00:04:37.690> comes<00:04:37.990> out<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:39.490> immediately

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
fan comes out and it immediately

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.900 
fan comes out and it immediately
diffuses<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.840> fog<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.620> aim<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.760> with

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
diffuses the fog and you aim it with

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.240 
diffuses the fog and you aim it with
this<00:04:43.060> little<00:04:43.390> guy<00:04:43.540> here<00:04:43.990> can<00:04:44.560> hear<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.860> ratchet
