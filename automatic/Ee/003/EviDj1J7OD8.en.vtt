00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
not struggle too much because we've been

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.650 
not struggle too much because we've been

just get this win and go home nice sack

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.050 
just get this win and go home nice sack
there<00:03:15.630> by<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> defense<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.860> believe<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.640> was

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
there by the defense I believe that was

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.150 
there by the defense I believe that was
Carlos<00:03:18.540> Dunlap<00:03:18.810> with<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> sack<00:03:19.560> force<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.070> a

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
Carlos Dunlap with the sack force is a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.940 
Carlos Dunlap with the sack force is a
third<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.790> 17<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:22.110> was<00:03:22.290> playing<00:03:22.620> that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
third and 17 and I was playing that

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.789 
third and 17 and I was playing that
route<00:03:23.250> perfectly<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.930> mistimed<00:03:25.530> it

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
route perfectly but I just mistimed it

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.039 
route perfectly but I just mistimed it
allows<00:03:26.610> him<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.910> get<00:03:27.120> another<00:03:27.360> first<00:03:27.630> down<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
allows him to get another first down so

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.390 
allows him to get another first down so
he's<00:03:28.230> moving<00:03:28.650> down<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.950> field<00:03:28.980> we're

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
he's moving down the field we're

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.190 
he's moving down the field we're
approaching<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.000> 2-minute<00:03:30.390> warning<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.870> I'm

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
approaching the 2-minute warning and I'm

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.199 
approaching the 2-minute warning and I'm
pretty<00:03:31.470> sure<00:03:31.560> he<00:03:31.890> ran<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.280> same<00:03:32.549> exact<00:03:33.000> play

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
pretty sure he ran the same exact play

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.750 
pretty sure he ran the same exact play
he's<00:03:33.420> scored<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.959> earlier<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> game<00:03:35.280> right

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
he's scored on earlier in the game right

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.400 
he's scored on earlier in the game right
down<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> middle<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> field<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.200> he's

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
down the middle of the field so he's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.030 
down the middle of the field so he's
down<00:03:37.739> now<00:03:38.040> 7<00:03:38.640> or<00:03:38.850> 21<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.930> 14<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.799> got<00:03:40.920> to

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
down now 7 or 21 to 14 we just got to

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.259
