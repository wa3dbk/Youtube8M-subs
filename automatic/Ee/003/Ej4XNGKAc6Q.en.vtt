back far enough for me reading to see

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.140 
back far enough for me reading to see
three<00:01:24.000> things<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.540> pillow<00:01:25.350> downhill<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.400> left

don't worry about just go back far

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.410 
don't worry about just go back far
enough<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.520> eyes<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
enough so your eyes can see the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
enough so your eyes can see the
geography<00:01:34.020> okay<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.790> first<00:01:36.090> look<00:01:36.300> of<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
geography okay the first look of the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200 
geography okay the first look of the
five<00:01:36.810> looks<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> right<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.160> we're<00:01:38.909> seeing

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
five looks is right here we're seeing

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
five looks is right here we're seeing
what<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.659> from<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.440> ball<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.920> hole<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
what look from the ball to the hole the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.030 
what look from the ball to the hole the
distance<00:01:41.840> speed<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.170> critical<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.650> putting

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
distance speed is so critical in putting

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
distance speed is so critical in putting
okay<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.480> see<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> distance<00:01:46.200> with

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
okay we need to see the distance with

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.610 
okay we need to see the distance with
our<00:01:46.500> eyes<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.540> now<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.560> to

strokes each practice stroke we look at

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
strokes each practice stroke we look at
the<00:01:56.040> distance<00:01:56.460> between<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.970> ball<00:01:57.150> on<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
