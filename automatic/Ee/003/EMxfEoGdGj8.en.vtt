possible<00:03:57.030> which<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.390> downloading<00:03:58.019> windows<00:03:58.230> 10

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
possible which is downloading windows 10

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.670 
possible which is downloading windows 10
directly<00:03:59.099> from<00:03:59.220> Microsoft<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
tutorial I have outlined tonight has

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.350 
tutorial I have outlined tonight has
basically<00:04:04.709> just<00:04:04.950> said<00:04:05.220> look<00:04:05.610> if<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:06.030> do<00:04:06.209> these

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
basically just said look if you do these

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.449 
basically just said look if you do these
above<00:04:06.780> steps<00:04:07.110> you're<00:04:07.379> basically<00:04:07.830> forcing

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
above steps you're basically forcing

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.839 
above steps you're basically forcing
Microsoft<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.390> send<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.989> Windows<00:04:10.830> 8<00:04:11.129> whether
