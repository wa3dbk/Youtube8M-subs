00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
roster is really unlucky they definitely

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.070

right<00:00:28.410> tackle<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.099> guard<00:00:29.330> that<00:00:30.330> could

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
right tackle or guard that could

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990 
right tackle or guard that could
definitely<00:00:30.720> come<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> perhaps<00:00:32.369> beat<00:00:32.820> out
