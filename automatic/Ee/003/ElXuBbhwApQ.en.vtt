00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
receiver that could be really valuable
on<00:01:24.210> third<00:01:24.390> down<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.810> here's<00:01:24.960> another<00:01:25.140> guard

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
on third down or here's another guard

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289 
on third down or here's another guard
that<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.890> run<00:01:26.100> his<00:01:26.250> feet<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:27.180> me

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that can really run his feet so for me

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
that can really run his feet so for me
that<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> more<00:01:27.990> valuable<00:01:28.439> time<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that was the more valuable time to get a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.950 
that was the more valuable time to get a
chance<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> evaluate<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> players<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
chance to evaluate all the players and I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.569 
chance to evaluate all the players and I
kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> tried<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.100> watching<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
kind of tried to keep watching the

for me to get to know the guys more I
can't<00:01:35.700> wait<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> again<00:01:36.270> tonight

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can't wait to do that again tonight

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
can't wait to do that again tonight
there's<00:01:37.110> always<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.500> cross<00:01:37.710> training<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
there's always some cross training that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.410 
there's always some cross training that
goes<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> mentioned<00:01:38.939> yesterday<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
goes on but you mentioned yesterday that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
goes on but you mentioned yesterday that
there<00:01:40.079> might<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.259> some<00:01:40.500> experimentation<00:01:41.009> with

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
there might be some experimentation with

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
there might be some experimentation with
different<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.420> changing<00:01:42.720> positions

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
different you know changing positions

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.800 
different you know changing positions
how<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.630> will

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
how is that just like you know from will

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.149 
how is that just like you know from will
to<00:01:45.960> Mike<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.290> something<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.680> dramatic<00:01:46.829> than

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to Mike or something more dramatic than

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.170 
to Mike or something more dramatic than
that<00:01:47.340> I'd<00:01:47.490> say<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.670> probably<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.030> more

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that I'd say is probably a little more

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
that I'd say is probably a little more
dramatic<00:01:48.390> than<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.110> terms<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> know

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
dramatic than that in terms of you know

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
dramatic than that in terms of you know
it<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> safety<00:01:50.460> play<00:01:50.640> nickel<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it can a safety play nickel can a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
it can a safety play nickel can a
linebacker<00:01:51.630> play<00:01:51.899> defensive<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
linebacker play defensive end and I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
linebacker play defensive end and I
think<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> time<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> find<00:01:54.750> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
think now is the time to find that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.899 
think now is the time to find that
versatility<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.490> player<00:01:56.729> has

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
versatility and if we think a player has

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639 
versatility and if we think a player has
certain<00:01:57.270> traits<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
certain traits to do that now is the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
certain traits to do that now is the
time<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:58.860> us<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.310> coaches<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.850> feature<00:02:00.030> some

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
time for us as coaches to feature some

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.389 
time for us as coaches to feature some
plays<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.540> design<00:02:01.079> some<00:02:01.320> plays<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
plays and design some plays to see you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.160 
plays and design some plays to see you
know<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> player<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.840> also<00:02:03.990> had

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
know what a player can do we also had

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.179 
know what a player can do we also had
some<00:02:04.290> players<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.649> were<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.009> tryout

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
some players that were here on a tryout

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
some players that were here on a tryout
basis<00:02:05.640> we're<00:02:05.850> trying<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> can

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
basis we're trying to see you know can

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.270 
basis we're trying to see you know can
we<00:02:07.110> feature<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.740> put<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> role

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
we feature them and put them in a role

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
we feature them and put them in a role
to<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.610> where<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.509> their

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to see where we can see them at their

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.500 
to see where we can see them at their
best<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> versatility<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.819> key<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
best so the versatility is key and that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.430 
best so the versatility is key and that
way<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:13.080> we're<00:02:13.230> play

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
way when we're play
