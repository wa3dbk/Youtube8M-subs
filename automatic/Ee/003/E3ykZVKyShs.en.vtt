00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.610
 ourselves bubble today 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.869
 for a year earlier on the scorers of the engine a trace 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.599
 and not on the full mode because I've already seen several days earlier 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.890
 do not push the trouble 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.079
 how to complain 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.259
 but I had trouble finding tutorials six years ago on the buzzer 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.539
 so I offered myself 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.310
 then the leader is used to rebuild 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.680
 something you have selected 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.540
 why do that right now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 we will make a selection space with markers 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.370
 during childhood barn 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.980
 you do it 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.980
 note that you want 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 we do when the cube 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.610
 my sense of where I do it without really understanding what we can do 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.490
 concretely 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 so you took your space of seduction 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 you ask a day a technique 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.940
 next to a marker 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.940
 so the space he unleashed 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.810
 e so that's it so now advise you what you want so 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 I often think 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 Highway 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 we're going to end blake i love you knight 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.100
 in the skin of a premium 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.650
 such a planet 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.680
 so there actually they are worth 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.470
 he recorded on my planet e theme 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.530
 what we just built 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 and a good thirty more than me I've already done six or eight weeks 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.780
 it's a sixth 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 and we'll put him in the bump 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.440
 so for the bottle we put it 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.050
 next in a chip 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.090
 but young people who says waters 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.779
 what did I do that is on the chain 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:09.809
 % 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.639
 how to build 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.219
 so for the moment we ask builders no need for selection species 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.299
 everything is recorded in the tempo was paused the planet theme on 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.319
 sees that his section 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.480
 and we can put that in the building resources with what we can 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.049
 rebuild what we just did 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.479
 there for example we would have liked the month 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.109
 they have right who will rebuild a good it's automatic 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.689
 she requires done exactly what I did there 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.969
 that's all for 8 2 eur the Chinese were very short 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.719
 but there are no great things to say 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.539
 so the veil spurs 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:01.779
 see you again on the channel e for this doubt earlier fashion presentation 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.829
 etc. 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:04.370
 no more
