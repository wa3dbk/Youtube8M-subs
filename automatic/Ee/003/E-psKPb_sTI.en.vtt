00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.100 
you do there if that's what you're doing
that's<00:02:09.020> what<00:02:09.259> it's<00:02:09.440> doing<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.390> can<00:02:14.569> see<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.989> in

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that's what it's doing you can see it in

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.160 
that's what it's doing you can see it in
there<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.560> catch<00:02:15.920> them<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.630> what<00:02:17.810> you'll<00:02:17.989> do

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
there to catch them but what you'll do

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.860 
there to catch them but what you'll do
fucking-a<00:02:19.040> now<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.819> it's<00:02:19.970> fitting<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
fucking-a now if it's fitting a you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.990 
fucking-a now if it's fitting a you
definitely<00:02:21.410> don't<00:02:21.590> want<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:22.010> fitting<00:02:22.760> B

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
definitely don't want to do fitting B

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.330 
definitely don't want to do fitting B
because<00:02:23.690> you'll<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.900> removing<00:02:24.739> way<00:02:24.950> too<00:02:25.010> much

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
because you'll be removing way too much

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.990 
because you'll be removing way too much
material<00:02:25.880> from<00:02:26.600> fitting<00:02:27.019> B<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.470> try<00:02:27.709> to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
material from fitting B to try to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.770 
material from fitting B to try to
compensate<00:02:29.000> for<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.050> fit<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.550> for<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.790> all

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
compensate for the a fit but for a all

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.860 
compensate for the a fit but for a all
you<00:02:32.900> do<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.440> take<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.130> file<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.760> you'll<00:02:35.720> just

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
you do just take a file and you'll just

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.590 
you do just take a file and you'll just
be<00:02:35.989> round<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.800> corner<00:02:37.790> over<00:02:37.819> here<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
be round in this corner over here just a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.789 
be round in this corner over here just a
little<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:41.799> you'll

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
little bit like right here and you'll

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.199 
little bit like right here and you'll
take<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.190> sharp<00:02:43.459> edge<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.910> you'll<00:02:44.030> just

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
take the sharp edge and you'll just

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.520 
take the sharp edge and you'll just
round<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.660> over<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> little<00:02:45.170> bit<00:02:46.959> just<00:02:47.959> only

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
round it over a little bit just only

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
round it over a little bit just only
removing<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:49.580> bit<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.420> you're

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
removing just a little bit if you're

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.840 
removing just a little bit if you're
removing<00:02:50.930> more<00:02:51.290> than<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.769> from<00:02:52.370> any<00:02:52.610> of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
removing more than just from any of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.590 
removing more than just from any of
these<00:02:52.970> fittings<00:02:53.420> you're<00:02:53.660> removing<00:02:53.989> too<00:02:54.290> much

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.650 

check<00:03:02.600> for<00:03:02.840> fit<00:03:03.049> often<00:03:03.560> all<00:03:04.519> right<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:05.540> was

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
check for fit often all right that was

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.240 
check for fit often all right that was
enough<00:03:05.930> for<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.290> one<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.769> might<00:03:07.010> need<00:03:07.220> a

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
enough for this one so I might need a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.970 
enough for this one so I might need a
little<00:03:07.459> more<00:03:07.579> taking<00:03:08.239> off<00:03:08.390> but<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.709> can<00:03:09.829> see

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
little more taking off but you can see

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.699 
little more taking off but you can see
now<00:03:10.190> it's<00:03:10.870> coming<00:03:11.870> all<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.170> way<00:03:12.260> up<00:03:12.500> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
now it's coming all the way up and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.949 
now it's coming all the way up and
meeting<00:03:13.000> now<00:03:14.000> if<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.420> what<00:03:14.450> your<00:03:14.750> drum

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
meeting now if this is what your drum

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.069 
meeting now if this is what your drum
looks<00:03:15.109> like<00:03:15.350> from<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> start<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.160> can<00:03:16.340> skip

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
looks like from the start you can skip

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.530 
looks like from the start you can skip
fitting<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.620> right<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.980> fitting<00:03:19.310> B<00:03:19.540> but

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
fitting a and go right to fitting B but

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.050 
fitting a and go right to fitting B but
if<00:03:20.840> not<00:03:21.079> if<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:22.250> know<00:03:22.280> do<00:03:22.579> fitting<00:03:22.940> a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
if not if it's you know do fitting a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.340 
if not if it's you know do fitting a
until<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.840> achieve<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.709> fit<00:03:25.040> right<00:03:25.400> there

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
until you achieve that fit right there

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.170 
until you achieve that fit right there
if<00:03:27.350> your<00:03:28.010> drones<00:03:28.280> going<00:03:28.579> all<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> way<00:03:28.880> up<00:03:29.060> like

that and that's still not walking in you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.670 
that and that's still not walking in you
need<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.989> do<00:03:33.489> befitting<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:35.269> that's<00:03:35.680> removing

nice<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.870> flat<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.520> knock<00:04:31.729> some

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
nice and flat on it it's to knock some

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.360 
nice and flat on it it's to knock some
of<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.270> off<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:33.500> don't<00:04:33.680> really<00:04:33.800> wanna<00:04:34.100> round

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
of it off you don't really wanna round

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.670 
of it off you don't really wanna round
corners<00:04:35.090> here<00:04:37.690> let's<00:04:38.690> hit<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.990> nice<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.199> flush

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
corners here let's hit it nice and flush

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.129 
corners here let's hit it nice and flush
on<00:04:39.949> there<00:04:41.710> see<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:42.800> that's<00:04:42.979> enough<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.900> check

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
on there see if that's enough and check

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.960 
on there see if that's enough and check
for<00:04:45.169> fit<00:04:45.500> often<00:04:45.919> as<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.190> can<00:04:46.220> see<00:04:46.490> it's<00:04:46.639> just

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
for fit often as you can see it's just

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.730 
for fit often as you can see it's just
dust<00:04:47.360> coming<00:04:47.750> off<00:04:47.930> here<00:04:50.380> now<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.560> one<00:04:51.710> is

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
dust coming off here now that one is

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.189 
dust coming off here now that one is
locking<00:04:52.610> just<00:04:52.820> a<00:04:52.910> little<00:04:53.150> bit<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.139> not

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
locking just a little bit but it's not

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.740 
locking just a little bit but it's not
locking<00:04:54.560> with<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.919> good<00:04:55.160> snap<00:04:55.550> it's<00:04:55.910> as<00:04:56.419> you<00:04:56.570> can

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
locking with a good snap it's as you can

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.020 
locking with a good snap it's as you can
see<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.110> here<00:04:57.410> it's<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:57.889> barely<00:04:58.250> underneath

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
see in here it's just barely underneath

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.050 
see in here it's just barely underneath
there<00:04:59.330> that<00:05:00.110> mag<00:05:00.349> release<00:05:00.560> lever<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.870> sitting

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
there that mag release lever is sitting

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.250 
there that mag release lever is sitting
probably<00:05:05.060> just<00:05:05.240> right<00:05:05.510> there<00:05:05.840> barely

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
probably just right there barely

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.350 
probably just right there barely
underneath<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.310> wanna<00:05:07.639> all<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.210> way

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
underneath it and you wanna all the way

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:25.980 
underneath it and you wanna all the way
up<00:05:08.539> against<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.970> just<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.060> little<00:05:11.210> more<00:05:11.450> on<00:05:11.599> here

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.020 

it's<00:05:26.990> still<00:05:27.290> catching<00:05:27.740> just<00:05:27.920> a<00:05:28.040> little<00:05:28.280> bit<00:05:28.490> at

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
it's still catching just a little bit at

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.670 
it's still catching just a little bit at
this<00:05:29.150> point<00:05:29.510> you<00:05:29.600> can<00:05:29.750> probably<00:05:30.020> make<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.530> give

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
this point you can probably make it give

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.770 
this point you can probably make it give
up<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.040> rest<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.490> way<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.450> might<00:05:32.600> be

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
up the rest of the way and you might be

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.350 
up the rest of the way and you might be
able<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:32.990> finish<00:05:33.230> breaking<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.920> in<00:05:34.100> just<00:05:34.430> by

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
able to finish breaking it in just by

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.600 
able to finish breaking it in just by
working<00:05:35.600> that<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:35.990> few<00:05:36.290> times<00:05:36.320> but<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.400> want<00:05:37.580> to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
working that a few times but you want to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.090 
working that a few times but you want to
make<00:05:37.760> sure<00:05:37.790> when<00:05:38.330> you're<00:05:38.480> locking<00:05:38.690> it<00:05:39.100> that

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
make sure when you're locking it that

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.250 
make sure when you're locking it that
it'll<00:05:40.370> go<00:05:40.520> all<00:05:40.790> the<00:05:40.940> way<00:05:40.970> up<00:05:41.270> it's<00:05:41.840> still<00:05:42.050> not

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
it'll go all the way up it's still not

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.630 
it'll go all the way up it's still not
done<00:05:43.870> let's<00:05:44.870> take<00:05:45.170> a<00:05:45.200> little<00:05:45.500> more<00:05:45.710> off<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:46.520> a

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
done let's take a little more off just a

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:56.460 
done let's take a little more off just a
little<00:05:46.670> at<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.090> time<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.780> keep<00:05:48.020> checking<00:05:48.380> and

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.710 

it's<00:05:57.470> easy<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.800> take<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.100> little<00:05:58.400> off<00:05:58.670> and<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.150> lot

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
it's easy to take a little off and a lot

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.200 
it's easy to take a little off and a lot
harder<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.170> put<00:06:00.350> it<00:06:00.470> back<00:06:00.650> but<00:06:01.580> even<00:06:01.730> if<00:06:01.910> you<00:06:02.030> do

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
harder to put it back but even if you do

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.060 
harder to put it back but even if you do
it's<00:06:02.510> it's<00:06:02.990> not<00:06:03.170> going<00:06:03.350> to<00:06:03.440> tear<00:06:03.590> anything<00:06:03.800> up

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
it's it's not going to tear anything up

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.580 
it's it's not going to tear anything up
your<00:06:05.060> drum<00:06:05.270> will<00:06:05.420> just<00:06:05.630> fit<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> little<00:06:06.110> looser

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
your drum will just fit a little looser

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.810 
your drum will just fit a little looser
when<00:06:06.830> but<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.520> could<00:06:07.700> be<00:06:07.880> it<00:06:07.970> nice<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.330> tight

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.460 

see<00:06:13.820> it's<00:06:13.970> closing<00:06:14.240> up<00:06:14.480> easy<00:06:14.690> here<00:06:14.990> now<00:06:15.170> but

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
see it's closing up easy here now but

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.940 
see it's closing up easy here now but
you<00:06:15.920> want<00:06:16.070> it<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.250> really<00:06:17.410> snap<00:06:18.410> all<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.830> way

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 
you want it to really snap all the way

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.300 
you want it to really snap all the way
up<00:06:19.190> on<00:06:19.400> its<00:06:19.580> own<00:06:20.740> take<00:06:21.740> a<00:06:21.770> little<00:06:22.040> more<00:06:22.250> off

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
up on its own take a little more off

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:43.560 
up on its own take a little more off
here

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.470

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
see now it's blocking completely up all

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.990 
see now it's blocking completely up all
the<00:06:47.630> way<00:06:47.780> against<00:06:48.230> the<00:06:48.410> feed<00:06:49.250> lips<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:49.880> the
