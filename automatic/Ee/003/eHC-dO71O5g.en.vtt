00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.089
 hello you blogger and today we 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.750
 We will deal with you such a problem 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.660
 Hanging tablet samsung galaxy tab 3 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.800
 it's pretty old model and iron 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.960
 you yourself understand not new but for everyone 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 applications that go this tablet 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 already too weak let's say this and therefore 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.240
 it does not river hang at which you can 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 rid only complete discharge 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 batteries or the way i am now 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.920
 I'll show you and so we for this 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.920
 let's assume that Iâ€™ll flip it now 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.550
 Here we assume that our will get hung 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 that's what we do for it for this 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.640
 need to hold the power key 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.149
 that is, this one and the volume key 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.840
 up 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:04.799
 when we do the next action 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.860
 the tablet should reboot here it is 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 the vibration turned off and here it is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 I generally connect to what I'm writing this 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.150
 seen because let's say in a few 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.080
 my friends have such a tablet in that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.390
 including me and many of them 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 face a similar problem not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.159
 can and decide what really means me 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.090
 strongly surprised taking off by the way 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.090
 lg nexus 5 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.840
 great phone and on like 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.079
 There are no problems because iron is almost 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.530
 not twice as powerful as this 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.500
 tablet 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 here is our tablet rebooted and how we 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.820
 can see earrings can see you 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.439
 get you won't see attached all 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.090
 logs slept the system will arrive best 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.840
 clean the tablet from time to time 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.439
 root menu 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.399
 because it clogs up with any unnecessary 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.590
 applications 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.689
 Well, in general, all they actually want 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.250
 say thanks for watching put 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.250
