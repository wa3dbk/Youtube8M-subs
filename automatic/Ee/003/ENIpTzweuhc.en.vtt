00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.100
 very good to all and today I bring you a 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:09.860
 program that was what what does 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.699
 it is basically to do what you 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.469
 sort with the mouse or with the keyboard by 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.420
 example there is an order and you can 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.950
 repeat as many times as you want saying 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 hundreds are endless 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.560
 and well, it basically serves 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.210
 example if you have to click on some 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 ad constantly or to see 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 ads or whatever to earn us 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 some money on the internet or any 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 another thing is worth that, you have to be special 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.040
 very repetitive because this is the program 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.870
 no longer good then to install it because it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.060
 we double click 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.430
 we give you if it comes out next accepted next 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.160
 here then edition of where is going to 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 install the program 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.200
 we know that here that is going to create the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 unique on the desk 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.710
 let's also say that if not install 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.049
 once 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 when it has been installed 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.340
 in general the program is this vale 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.700
 and well, we give you double click to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700
 get in 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.119
 and good here you have the program and good 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 well basically it 's pretty easy to 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.040
 use vale here for example you can give 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.760
 advanced and here you choose how many times 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:44.440
 you want to play them and for example they are 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.810
 me 10,000 and if we put it to zero you see 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.970
 what says zero is the infinite name 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.110
 and you can not do infinitely good 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 as you want, it's good, let's go, ok, 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.390
 who 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.140
 in settings here it says control control 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.260
 1 to record and control control 2 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.570
 to stop it 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.140
 and basically this is the most important thing 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.080
 that you must know this great thing 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.830
 Well, what we have to do is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.830
 hit the record 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.450
 and for example now we have to do is 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.980
 what I know where you want used you can 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.770
 do on the internet where thank you but 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.240
 well I'll do it here as an example 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:42.340
 for example I'm here the disco team 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:45.720
 kf profiles under course and I close and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.940
 I give control 2 to stop to record not 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.830
 I say control 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.400
 and then here you can give play to 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.260
 to see how it is to give play the mouse 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.260
 now he is going to move alone 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.129
 here we can see that it is already very 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.129
 well our mouse 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.920
 facebook and pop albums 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.380
 Rafael goes up and down 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.700
 but do 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.700
 you see 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.220
 and he repeats it again as 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.200
 I have zeroed in countless times 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.800
 he will do it every time they do 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.770
 miss we're going 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.960
 and basically it opens with everyone 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:47.190
 to stop it to save it we give it to you 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.800
 and for example we give you a new 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.180
 and so if we want to load what we have 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.180
 saved we give to the local 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.380
 and since then you will have here 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.380
 everything basically 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 that is, so to speak, all those that 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.769
 you have saved 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.510
 and it is already loading it, loading it and 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.280
 dais a play 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.000
 and already put it will reproduce how many 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.980
 sometimes want and also serves to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.130
 for the letters for the keyboard I want 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.130
 say for example we create here 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.190
 and a text document is worth 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:36.639
 and we do this for example 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:40.889
 we give him a record we want him to enter here 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.889
 to write hello 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.230
 to save 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 let's say against the one 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.790
 we give him play 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.790
 in the way he repeats 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.539
 6 write again now 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.880
 but to save 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.900
 You also see that I like this program 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.560
 quite is it is very useful 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.700
 and good 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.360
 the sand book in the description and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.770
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.780
 give it like share it if you want 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.780
 and she'll come later
