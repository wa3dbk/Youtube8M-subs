00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.580
 new beginning in the history of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.680
 tablets of this company like could 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 augure it after all the rumors 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.039
 the new ipad 5 or good ipad air shows 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.920
 changes in your design that is now a lot 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.110
 more like the ipad mini keeps its 9 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 7 inches points but it is lighter 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.039
 less thick and with a new 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.770
 architecture in your guts for 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.869
 offer you a better use and performance to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.690
 all the people who are going to acquire it 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.350
 is are some of its features is 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.840
 very thin it has only 7.5 millimeters of 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.980
 Thickness 20 percent thinner than 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.160
 previous comparison 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.870
 weighs about 400 53 grams 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.840
 includes the chip to 7 64-bit 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.480
 processor m 78 times faster than the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 previous generation and with graphics 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.030
 better 72 times more than its predecessor 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.680
 as always you have to wait for the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.599
 official information about your arrival 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.400
 to mexico but good is nothing 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.140
 crazy to think that we will see it in 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.950
 our country during the times 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 decembrinas 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.250
 apple has also updated its 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.190
 computers for professionals 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.040
 macbook pro apple promises that these are 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.800
 thinner faster and with a long 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.590
 life in the battery much more than 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 previous models the pro macbook will come 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.850
 in two different sizes the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.980
 13-inch computers and those of 15 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.620
 All these models will have the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.340
 new apple operating system the mac 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.980
 osx or that 10.9 mavericks the model of 13 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.400
 inch is thinner than before 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.360
 only 1.85 centimeters thick and weighs 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.550
 only 1.56 kilograms is the macbook 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 pro thinner and lighter until the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.570
 moment of course he also received a 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.700
 activation of the rest of the hardware with a 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.739
 Intel's latest generation processor 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.750
 and well maybe the most important change 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.850
 as we already mentioned is the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.500
 battery which uses the same 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.110
 technology that comes in the macbook r 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.200
 this technology allows you to have up to 9 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.670
 hours of battery with a single charge and the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.630
 price of this computer is 1200 99 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.430
 Dollars 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.860
 the 15 inch pro macbook also 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.380
 received its own activations the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.320
 The battery will last up to 8 hours with a 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.680
 single load and its lowest configuration 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.590
 will have an intel core i7 processor 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.370
 dossiers with 8 gigabytes of ram and a 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:21.840
 256gb solid state hard drive its 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.840
 price starts from the 1999 dollars 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.720
 and finally a last update 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.490
 done within the line of 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.430
 apple products was the launch 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.159
 of the new mac or s10 operating system 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.310
 mavericks which is free and is 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.569
 available as of today 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.550
 new version of this operating system 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.710
 it comes with several improvements including 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.020
 well obviously this according to the people of 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.060
 I support improvements in performance and consumption 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.000
 of battery this means that good 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.860
 theoretically your old macbook is going to have 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.169
 much more battery better performance in 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.050
 this in this area and it will run in a 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:02.069
 much faster all this information 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.680
 good is obtained through all the 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.020
 streaming that was making apple and 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.690
 obviously compiled by the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.250
 hard work of jimena de morelos and the 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.250
 Lord Angel Souza 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.710
 well, in addition to an event where 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.150
 really those own clichÃ©s fall 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.800
 people of apulia, from the most 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.930
 how to say it , everything arrives 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.410
 we expected 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.350
 the format at the same time that already surprises 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.990
 little apple people if you keep throwing 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.669
 some products but they do not follow 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.800
 launching products with the pace that we 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.830
 he had customary products that 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.270
 revolution in the market at the end 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.169
 updates everything is worked 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.690
 from the last we can say almost already 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.490
 24 months are warning updates 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.770
 of all its products systems 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.210
 operational computers issues of 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.360
 applications obviously affects 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.970
 electronics is everything all there in the end is 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.520
 that update no product that 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.810
 revolutionize practically the same 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.599
 designs in order really novelty 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.580
 novelty nothing now well removing us 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.639
 this question of all negative then 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.220
 is father because maybe the people who 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.380
 use a lot for example the arepas you 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.240
 will find a great benefit to that 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.380
 be much faster with new 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.210
 processors 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.060
 is that for all those who work 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.610
 and they use our devices as 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.160
 his weapon every day is going to be a 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.950
 it's great news now the news that 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.440
 at the end it puts us a little on the web to 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.170
 When will the year arrive? 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.590
 past they arrived almost until December it was 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:53.560
 It was a mess and good at the end 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.260
 if you were told by several specialists and 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.120
 colleagues bloggers that I think there's more 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.490
 countries where will you go in africa that 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.220
 the one of the countries that will arrive from 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.160
 way let's say quick that from 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.260
 latin america or at the end apple no 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.990
 wants mexico apple does not want to 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.210
 Latin America because if you would like us 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.850
 and if we put a market that really 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.650
 will matter to this company would give more 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.050
 priority to launching these 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:23.380
 products in order always touches us until 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:27.100
 the second or third rounds question 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.810
 sad I am Luis, I said please, no 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.810
