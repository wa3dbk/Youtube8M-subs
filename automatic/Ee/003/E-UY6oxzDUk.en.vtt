00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Does that not interest you? 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.799
 wake up dollar entertaining no what 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.690
 missing music music is an exciting one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.860
 the topic is an organized sound event 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.570
 that the human being in his mood 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 can affect how can change 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 picking up something is what music is and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.310
 how it works I could do now 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.320
 for hours you can but easy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.400
 click on the wikipedia link of the 4 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.439
 Let's go over what I really do 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 interested in games and music something like that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 how sound in itself has always been in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.449
 At that time, however, playing often fell 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.250
 a little sparse that was fast 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 very monotonous and it did not take long 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.460
 up to 8 bit chips at some point too 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.719
 melodies tolerated the were however 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 Almost he programmed as 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.090
 composing that was really a tap 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 from the hexadecimal and much 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.079
 Programming and one out so long 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.539
 They are also missing something 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 keep calming down though was 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.629
 the cornerstone laid and while 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 all this evolved with the times 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.629
 most of them are aware of only the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 Visual developments are not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.969
 really a good deal for sound 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 check is often in my opinion 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.660
 more important than an extremely important one 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 technology scaffold studies even say that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 first background music for many 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 makes the world appear real before it 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.390
 Software only as pixel three 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.769
 perceived 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 I could be a bit jaded 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.470
 play if you do not have a soundcheck 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 there is always quite honest but before 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.619
 we lose ourselves packed in rome here 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.090
 Let's get to the application methods 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 of music in games then it would be first 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.450
 the very simple background music in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
 what would be an exploration by skyrim 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.409
 not ever edge without the partial 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.759
 slightly melancholic pieces or one 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.470
 reader without ground quiet of the small 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.030
 just get ready to play these two games 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 should be clear for what background music 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 It is mainly used around the world 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.619
 in which one is a certain 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.570
 painting to give a certain mood 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.799
 how big the influence of this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.670
 you move quickly when you're around 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.670
 appropriate music takes 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.770
 the mood just breaks and you 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.150
 What happens around you? 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.650
 do not record as it was from 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.330
 Developer is wanted, however, there 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.740
 especially with the so-called mood music 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.300
 to pay attention 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.650
 she must not be so intrusive then 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.729
 especially if you go through it for hours 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.679
 and the same world with the same 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.030
 background tunes should not be this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.890
 go on the nerves, there is the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.570
 summer at wow before so is the best choice 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.190
 only a few not too loud instruments 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.600
 to take and the chamber ensemble only 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.010
 to break out if really something 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.480
 happens though if a player 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.430
 rather not so extreme mood sets 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.560
 but rather on pure gameplay as well 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.940
 a lot of apps then like too 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.530
 many people take their own music 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.150
 For example, at cod you like to throw 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.260
 their youtube or spotify playlist 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.880
 and he can still do that as well 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 background music act at least 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.160
 if the only goal of the game is too 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.630
 to chat 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:47.320
 that would be the walking dead, for example 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:48.850
 then somehow stupid if people 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.200
 something relevant has happened then 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.640
 music to underscore that too 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.230
 that gives many moments only 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.880
 real weight and since we this 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.590
 teams then only for a short time listen 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.730
 No, these should be something too 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.320
 being intrusive 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.090
 Often you have a basic melody or one 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.650
 recognizable sound sequence the in 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 this happens again and again 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.140
 example of modern warfare 2 or 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.130
 max payne 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.660
 this should have a certain 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.070
 provide recognition and that 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.329
 she also works great often 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.829
 also easy in other checks 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.329
 involved or in another 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.459
 pitch with other instruments 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.110
 played when heavy rain is of course 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.940
 to know this catchy melody 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.320
 but is often used just because it is 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.000
 heavy the filming in comparison 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.950
 very long use time when playing with 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.420
 to fill music as said before it is 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.040
 important that I have the music to happen 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.630
 Adjusts and that forces the titles 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.850
 actually already to be dynamic 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.110
 that is to adapt to the happenings 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.519
 that's about as good as any game 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.110
 actually always present when from 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.730
 circulating in a fight is changed 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.380
 the best example is pay day 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.820
 as long as you can it is the music remains 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.620
 very quiet when you discover that 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.239
 the state wants to accumulate wins 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.950
 you drive a bit and a rush 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.600
 Then she breaks out that's good 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.650
 better indeed many facts with examples 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.060
 but let's be honest 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.560
 a few clicked me on this video 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.269
 listen to horny soundchecks here my 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.790
 personal top 5 which all something 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.230
 special in itself 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.579
 place 5 and that's the elder 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.019
 scrolls soundtracks because here you have 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.609
 if you already know an open world 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.079
 sometimes not only with mega 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.459
 epic teams but also sometimes with 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.959
 something one almost wants to say 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.189
 melancholic sounds that this 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.659
 play or at least you two 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.760
 played through in every area 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.109
 perfectly ready appropriate music had the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.640
 was just out and has the world around 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.959
 made a lot of living space four 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.760
 is the hotline miami sound check there 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.620
 oriented to a specific time 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.209
 and that captures pretty much without it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.919
 the existing technical to date 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.479
 to be aware of any limitations 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.430
 a kind house which rare setting 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.500
 so well described has place three of the pt 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.570
 1 and 2 soundcheck yes I have it 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.130
 but already mentioned package because if we 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.509
 then talk about dynamic music 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.039
 I just hurt it in the first one 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.720
 part of it probably a own piece of music 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.160
 has this one whole thing 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.570
 painting it and making it so perfect for 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
 for example, hectic or voltage too 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.500
 actually only produce these two 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.210
 emotions place two best is 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.740
 Actually, only everyone represents 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.270
 it sounds completely original otherwise 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.590
 you get chip and complete 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.479
 sung english again an endgame 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.650
 to come out music that can even be 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.300
 can stand alone 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.009
 First place is the journey soundcheck 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.110
 he is always present and influences 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.699
 every situation is so accurate that something like that 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.320
 how dialogue is not necessary 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.210
 just the soundcheck and insound here and 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.470
 because something flashes and that's enough and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.570
 so a game alone if so what 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.400
 can build up that is already a lot 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.900
 necessary but in a breath I have to 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.220
 also mention dark souls sometimes 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.900
 No soundcheck is the best 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.610
 soundcheck that often something yes there 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.870
 can be more realistic or something like that 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.190
 The direction you can sometimes agree 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.690
 some sound effects already one 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.500
 So the right soundtrack outperforms 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.500
 Let's enjoy the silence 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.320
 a viewer connection still dramatically 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.910
 and music in games is not 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.160
 closed circle on the contrary 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.170
 Games have started new jobs 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.640
 in the first place chiptuning pop and like her 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.020
 everybody can still be called today 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.580
 pixelated songs have a certain charm 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.260
 I personally think so 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.700
 much more interesting when these squeaking 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.200
 soundchip noises even with 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.340
 other instruments are mixed there 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.800
 I want the band where you live well 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.580
 because she shows how cool with music with e 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.580
 guitars can sound 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.830
 while some benzene 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.300
 computer music concentrate 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.980
 some computer games are concentrated 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.570
 on music like for example as 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.370
 Gameplay element as in the game you 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.600
 impossible game or super hexagon in 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.640
 the latter is a kind of music 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.050
 adrenaline rush which one in certain 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.520
 to bring moments back to you 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.470
 to go farthest one more step 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.700
 continue the music games audi cerf 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.020
 has just shown that the 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.250
 soundcheck not always after the game 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.020
 but also like to judge 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.370
 the other way around and being honest 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.050
 which soundcheck could be better 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.580
 as your own have some of you 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.080
 certainly all this is noticed here 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.700
 is very unstructured and you know 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.110
 why, because I do not care about you 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.790
 to pop facts on the table like 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.220
 usually but to show you 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.450
 how important music is some games are 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.890
 actually only because of the ingenious 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.450
 Soundchecks really known and the 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.070
 Most do not realize that 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.150
 next time you have a toy 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.560
 then pay attention 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.210
 what you hear it can I put under 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.800
 circumstances better than they think 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.010
 maybe even better than that 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.010
 game
