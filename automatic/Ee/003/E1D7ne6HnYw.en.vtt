00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.759

 at just over six meters 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 huge amount of handy gadget it is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 a herd 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.619
 that means a sports boat and you can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.619
 under the advantage 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.530
 it is a light yet sturdy 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.960
 built and that light has to be 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.610
 benefits on this boat you can trailer 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.589
 you don't have four behind a normal car 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.789
 four times needed 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.829
 well there is all the european 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.960
 inland waters your feet and that's why it is 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.170
 He also lives everywhere in Europe and especially 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 i were an american around there are two 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.399
 engine options 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.530
 standard that is also here in there is 135 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.969
 pk mercruiser engine 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.149
 if you don't think it's enough, you can too 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.369
 opt for a 4.2 liter v6 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.009
 and you have 220 horsepower for a moment 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.880
 give waterproof but here with that 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.200
 135hp 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 do you have power zapping 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.220
 you notice the underwater skippers well 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.720
 are easy when fast 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.720
 I have a very good turn 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.110
 also bucket seats that gives a wonderful 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.380
 a lot of support when you follow this kind of weird 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.380
 made 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.660
 it on 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.740
 you is about 4223 me that means 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.740
 more than 60 kilometers per hour 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 which is very nice so sails in the winter 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.430
 we are protected by the ear 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.330
 windshield 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.480
 how I do not suffer from the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 room actually 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.700
 what is striking is that the engine is the me 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.490
 here one but it remains an americans 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 and they always make a lot quickly 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 power just look 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 ergonomically this steering position is perfect 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.420
 you can handle it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.520
 adjust a perfect angle 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.510
 place to drop off with your feet and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.760
 that throttle 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.069
 it is in the most logical place 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 useful is that you leave the course here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.950
 can get as people can here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.840
 to get in 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.220
 I almost hated stabbing like 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 that people who step on your pillow 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.819
 well that you can easily remove then 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.819
 still great joke 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.019
 you can focus on this 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.440
 the tub benches that are so nice and high 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.180
 backrests 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.230
 so see if the boat is but really nice 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.230
 in it that gives a safe feeling 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.670
 what is also very handy is that the door 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.719
 to the cross 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.349
 at the same time as the stairs is 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.329
 sit comfortably 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.560
 that is delicious and this is also something that 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.560
 you do not see often in the sport photo 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.490
 you can take that out of your space for 2 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.870
 sleeping places and sufficient view height 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.660
 to be able to eat well as a fur 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.170
 outside is too cold and there is room for one 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.270
 small chemical college the bayliner 642 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.770
 is more than six and a half meters long and 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.720
 almost two and a half meters wide 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.069
 it is available at holland sport 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.499
 boat center 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.670
 if you check by this boat and 33,000 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.439
 euro costs 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.900
 we cannot get his apple beautiful otherwise 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.990
 conclude that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.210
 very good value for money 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.720
 or as the americans say 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.100
 lots of meat from the when all bo 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.210
