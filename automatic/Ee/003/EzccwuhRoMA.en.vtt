they're both words from the school of
fortune<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:10.950> only<00:00:11.280> for<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.610> next<00:00:11.700> few<00:00:12.090> months

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
said during the summer months so you've

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.710
