hi<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.480> my<00:00:06.810> entry<00:00:07.110> for<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.440> five<00:00:07.620> five

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
hi this is my entry for the five five

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.470 
hi this is my entry for the five five
five<00:00:08.010> design<00:00:08.430> contest<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.180> I'm<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
five design contest and I'm going to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.120 
five design contest and I'm going to
show<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.719> how<00:00:10.020> you<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.380> use<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> five<00:00:10.920> five

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
show you how you can use a five five

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.610 
show you how you can use a five five
five<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.639> drive<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> small<00:00:12.150> motor<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:13.260> can<00:00:13.320> do

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.200 
the screen these two signals when I
apply<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.290> motor<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.980> generate<00:02:08.460> voltages

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
apply to a motor will generate voltages

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.500 
apply to a motor will generate voltages
in<00:02:09.740> different<00:02:10.740> polarities<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
in different polarities and with a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.260 
in different polarities and with a
different<00:02:13.140> duty<00:02:13.950> cycle<00:02:14.580> which<00:02:14.730> allows<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
different duty cycle which allows the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.390 
different duty cycle which allows the
motor<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.900> run<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.260> both<00:02:16.410> directions<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
motor to run in both directions and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.210 
motor to run in both directions and
varying<00:02:17.970> speeds<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.650> see<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:19.950> using

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
varying speeds as you can see I'm using

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.550 
varying speeds as you can see I'm using
tools<00:02:20.700> per<00:02:21.000> division<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.720> an<00:02:21.870> amplitude<00:02:22.200> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
tools per division as an amplitude so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.200 
tools per division as an amplitude so
you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.860> guess<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.280> both<00:02:23.520> signals<00:02:24.000> are

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
you can guess that both signals are

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.250 
you can guess that both signals are
about<00:02:24.450> 3.3<00:02:25.260> volts<00:02:26.630> I've<00:02:27.630> connected<00:02:27.990> the

about 3.3 volts I've connected the

about 3.3 volts I've connected the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
scopes and I'm going to show you what

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
scopes and I'm going to show you what
the<00:02:31.650> signals<00:02:32.040> look<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.460> on<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.240> top<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the signals look like on the top and the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.260 
the signals look like on the top and the
bottom<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.620> actual<00:02:34.770> signals<00:02:35.430> coming

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
bottom I have the actual signals coming

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.850 
bottom I have the actual signals coming
out<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> H<00:02:36.870> bridge<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.320> I've<00:02:37.410> added<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
out of the H bridge and I've added the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.380 
out of the H bridge and I've added the
difference<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.550> middle<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.180> see

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
difference in the middle you can see

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.510 
difference in the middle you can see
that<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.840> vary<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.380> potentiometer<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:41.250> can

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
that if I vary the potentiometer I can

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.880 
that if I vary the potentiometer I can
obtain<00:02:41.670> either<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.720> negative<00:02:43.290> voltage<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:43.860> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
obtain either a negative voltage with a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130 
obtain either a negative voltage with a
variable<00:02:44.310> duty<00:02:44.790> cycle<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> positive

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
variable duty cycle or a positive

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
variable duty cycle or a positive
voltage<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.770> variable<00:02:47.130> duty<00:02:47.610> cycle<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
voltage with a variable duty cycle the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.960 
voltage with a variable duty cycle the
scale<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.050> now<00:02:49.290> 10<00:02:49.620> volts<00:02:49.980> per<00:02:50.130> division<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
scale is now 10 volts per division and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.360 
scale is now 10 volts per division and
as<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.390> may<00:02:51.540> see<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.200> slightly<00:02:53.040> larger

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
as you may see I have slightly larger

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.240 
as you may see I have slightly larger
than<00:02:53.790> one<00:02:53.970> division<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.750> maybe<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.410> about<00:02:55.470> 11

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
than one division so maybe it's about 11

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.580 
than one division so maybe it's about 11
volts<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.730> amplitude<00:02:57.120> which<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.720> what<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.410> is

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
volts in amplitude which is what it is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.770 
volts in amplitude which is what it is
expected<00:02:59.160> when<00:02:59.550> we<00:02:59.700> are<00:02:59.790> using<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.270> 12<00:03:00.420> volt

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
expected when we are using a 12 volt

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.830 
expected when we are using a 12 volt
power<00:03:00.990> supply<00:03:01.910> I've<00:03:02.910> connected<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.510> motor

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
power supply I've connected the motor

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.980 
power supply I've connected the motor
and<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.320> time<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.070> working

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.800 

as<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.710> can<00:03:11.890> see<00:03:12.220> it<00:03:12.400> started<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.570> can

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
as you can see it started and I can

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:28.070 
as you can see it started and I can
control<00:03:14.320> its<00:03:14.740> feed<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:19.030> way<00:03:19.270> around

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.670 

and<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.070> waveforms<00:03:29.790> are<00:03:30.000> noisier<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.260> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and the waveforms are noisier as we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.030 
and the waveforms are noisier as we
might<00:03:31.920> expect<00:03:32.100> having<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> motor<00:03:33.270> and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
might expect having the motor and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.400 
might expect having the motor and
there's<00:03:35.040> also<00:03:35.310> some<00:03:35.760> amplitude<00:03:36.570> dropping

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
there's also some amplitude dropping

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.440 
there's also some amplitude dropping
because<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.520> load<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.850> one<00:03:42.210> way

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
because we have load so that's one way

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.500 
because we have load so that's one way
