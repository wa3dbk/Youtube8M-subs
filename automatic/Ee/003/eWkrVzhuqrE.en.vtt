Hey guys today. I'm going to do a perfect eyebrow tutorial so stay tuned

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.660
What you require is a small scissor you usually get this in the store or the manicure kits

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.170
You also require the loose powder. Which is very dry

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.909
You require our soothing agent. I'm using Gulabari Rose water and you require a thread that is must

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.349
So to make the thread for the eyebrow. I am just taking out the thread from the thread reel that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.580
I have you can use this kind of thread because this is usually thicker than the usual swing thread and it pulls out the hair

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.489
Or cuts the hair more finer than the regular thread.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.489

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.899
You can find this thread at the dollar store

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.749
I remember I got the kit of - a white and black thread for the 99 cents

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.669
I guess so and this has been doing good for past two years so just take out almost

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.819
15 to 20 inches of the thread from it and just cut it with the help of a scissor

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.599
This thread is little thick so don't try to cut it with your hand you will end up cutting your skin

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.339
just use a scissor to cut it then you need to tie both the ends of the thread and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.859
make a knot here at the end of the thread so you have a circular thread in your hand and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.249
Just make sure that thread is secure to make it perfect. Just put two or three knots at this point

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.930
Now you need to hold your thread so see how I'm holding my thread

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.350
I am using my thumb and finger to just spread it and then put your hand from down to up

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.359
Both the hands from down to up and then rotate keep your left hand in the place and rotate your right hand twice

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.609
You can actually use both the hands to use it as it's redder

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.419
But the best way that I find is just keep your left hand in place

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.520
And just use your right hand for the threading

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.649
I have already done my left eyebrow

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.529
And you can see how it looks after the trimming so I will show you now how to do the right either

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.679
I am applying the compact Powder you can use any compact powder. Which is dry and loose powder

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.929
applying the powder on the eyebrows and the hair

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.369
Helps it easy for the thread to hold the hair and cut it or pull it out

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.369
So I'm just telling you again how to hold the thread

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.420
Just keep one hand in place and rotate the thread twice with the other hand and while cutting your eyebrows again

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.050
Just use one hand and let the other hand be on place

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.320
Let's begin place the thread under the hair in so in this point

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.339
You have to notice which direction your hair is going or going so you need to put the thread from the opposite Direction

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.280
of the hair growth and also

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.639
You need to make sure you first clean the hair from the area which is close to your natural eyebrow

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.270
Shaping or the shape that you want of the eyebrow, and then slowly you can cut or trim all the hair downwards

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.910
Threading can be used for eyebrows for upper lips for facial hair and also to remove the unremoved waxed hair from the body

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.429
There are a lot of benefits of eyebrow threading

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.200
like if you do threading

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.310
it gives your perfect shape it is quick and saves a lot of time it is less painful compared to tweezers because

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.268
Tweezers plugs one by one and it's much more painful

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.319
threading is less painful because it is quicker and faster as

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.220
Well as it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.229
Saves a lot of time of going to the saloon and it definitely saves a lot of money if you do it yourself

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.680
Once I do my eyebrows

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.430
I also make sure I clean my

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.570
Forehead with the same thread so you can just go up and just clean the area around your eyebrows

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.249
Which is just close to outer corner of off your eyes as well as the forehead area

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.709
And keep cleaning the small hair

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.339
Particles which fall on your face so that you do not put anything in your eyes and then with the help of this small scissor

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.419
I trim the extra hair at the beginning of the eyebrows

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.129
Once you do threading the results will last up to two to three weeks it depends on a person's hair of Growth

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.829
For me it usually lasts for two to three weeks

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.679
and if you do regular threading it also removes or

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.140
reduces the hair finally use a

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.830
astringent or A

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:17.320
Soothing lotion to apply it all over your eyebrows or the threaded area with the help of thick cotton and let this area on leave

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.510
Or lie like this for some time and you will have beautiful clean eyebrows

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.229
Now I'm going to have fun

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.650
