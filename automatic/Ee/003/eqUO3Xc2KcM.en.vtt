00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 what I am saying about the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.380
 The jury's transparency here is what 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.570
 is saying that if there is any complaint 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.619
 against none and says try 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.619
 you tell us about this center center 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.100
 it was obvious that according to justify 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.110
 talking about the telephone companies this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 He passed the phone dancing what they think of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:53.699
 all of that I do not think there's fraud but in 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.890
 your moment at that time do not speak I asked 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.460
 because he wanted to go because I felt bad 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.809
 Well I went back but he told me the phone 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 to send people on the phone 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.310
 I set up the phone and they said no 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.520
 they spoke I say so you see that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.490
 really then when I listen to her 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 evangelina is not saying that she 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 had agreed three weeks to stay 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.310
 only I can also feel 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.310

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.509
