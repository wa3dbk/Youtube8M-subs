00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.520
 in this short video you go 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.319
 discover an amazing technique for 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.880
 keep fruiting twigs all your life 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.380
 of your apple tree or pear tree disappearance 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 flowers at the base of the first and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 pear tree is a recurring problem 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.949
 most of the time nairas month fruit to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 the base of fruit trees 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.590
 disappear and the flowers are found 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
 at the end branches 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.680
 you will learn in this video 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 how to keep rats fruit month at the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 base of your weapons for the entire duration 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.770
 of life 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.700
 you will discover the four rules 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 basic to achieve this result 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.370
 rule number 1 handle the cap that leaves 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.559
 floral bouquet rule number 2 la 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.320
 verticality 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.660
 rule number 3 light 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.489
 rule number 4 the size of the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.840
 extensions 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's first see rule number 1 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 that is to say manage the bud that leaves 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the floral bouquet the twigs 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.309
 fructifers bearers of bourgeois flowers 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.770
 can last the life of the tree but 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 under certain conditions 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 in the spring, apple and pear trees 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.670
 bloom in most cases a 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 or more plugs develops at 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 from the floral bouquet you have to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.619
 cut two or three leaves 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.450
 when this buds to 5 to 7 leaves if 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.430
 you let the cork grow 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.560
 their hamlet of departure carrying fruit 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.780
 will become a wood bough much 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.040
 more powerful and without buttons to free 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 for the following year 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.630
 moreover this branch will generate 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.400
 plugs fled much further from the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.880
 frame yesterday and therefore less well 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 supplied with stage and light 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.549
 why trim it to two or three 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.350
 leaves and good for that sap 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 developed backs down leaves and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.630
 feed the little rat fruit month and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.090
 the future bourgeois flowers this little 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.430
 properly maintained branch will produce 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.700
 every year one or more buttons 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.090
 fruits now see rule number 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.180
 2 the verticality on the fields 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.489
 horizontal borders or assimilated 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.620
 caps on the top will generate 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.820
 vertical branches 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.980
 these vertical branches are 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.120
 shortcuts for the bean in order to reach 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.460
 to verticality 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010
 they become powerful and will only be 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.840
 never wear fruit buttons and they 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.090
 will destroy the traced shape of your 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.070
 trees you must remove them 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.940
 systematically whatever the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.250
 fruit species 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.930
 indeed the flowering twigs do not have to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.320
 not receive large amounts of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.980
 sap 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.450
 otherwise it turns into ram at bay 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.200
 rule number 3 the light the light is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.600
 indispensable for the twigs 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.360
 fructifers subsist if there is no 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.510
 enough light he dies 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.550
 irredeemably 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.040
 so you have to practice summer size 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.050
 or size in green so these twigs 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.720
 receive maximum light 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.370
 you will find on the blog the secrets 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.340
 the size of fruit trees 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 a chapter devoted to summer size 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.890
 or size in green without light no 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840
 button a fruit that's why the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.020
 more often we find the buttons to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.490
 fruit at the end at the end of 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.410
 branches 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.330
 rule number 4 the size of the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.010
 extensions the size of the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.680
 extensions of the carpenters of your 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.990
 fruit trees takes place in winter at 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.740
 from November to the month 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.930
 of February for apple and pear trees 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.890
 remove half of the extensions of 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.440
 the previous year 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.490
 why for the pressure of the sap 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.560
 at the base of its extensions 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.900
 increase due to size 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.090
 the buds will then be well fed 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.360
 and will easily transform years 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.310
 bojan flowering careful if you prune 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.260
 too short the plugs are too 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.150
 fed this is what happens most 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.770
 of time and the whole room gets 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.260
 will turn into a head of soil 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.290
 that is to say, a multitude of branches 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.380
 vigorous develops without pimples to 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.240
 fruits conversely if you do not trim 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.310
 extensions of the previous year 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.100
 the buds of this extension do not 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.900
 does not develop at the base of the branch 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.940
 The pressure of the sap will be 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.310
 the end of the year extension 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.510
 previous and the buds at the base of 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.450
 extension will disappear 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.280
 gradually the respect of his 80 he 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.250
 is essential to keep alive 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.410
 a word producers of sheep with flowers 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.660
 if you neglect one of his rules they 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.340
 will certainly disappear 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.669
 carpenters from the base of your trees 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.350
 will be stripped without a flower bud if 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.510
 you want to know other rules 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.919
 of gold to make the size of your 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.260
 fruit trees

 click on the link under the video where 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.860
 she's on the blog the secrets of the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.790
 size of fruit trees 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.790
 see you soon
