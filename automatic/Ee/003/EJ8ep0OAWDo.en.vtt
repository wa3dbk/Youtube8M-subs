so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> believe<00:01:22.530> it'll<00:01:23.070> work<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.549> all<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so I believe it'll work for you all to

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
so I believe it'll work for you all to
especially<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:24.570> shorter<00:01:24.900> than<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.200> guy

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
especially if you're shorter than my guy

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
especially if you're shorter than my guy
we're<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.670> vertical<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.240> hops

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
we're gonna have more vertical more hops

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
we're gonna have more vertical more hops
so<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> believe<00:01:28.619> you'll<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.159> jumping<00:01:29.520> over

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so I believe you'll just be jumping over

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580 
so I believe you'll just be jumping over
