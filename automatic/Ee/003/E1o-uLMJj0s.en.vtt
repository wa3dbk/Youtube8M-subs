recovery is better I feel a leader a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.439 
recovery is better I feel a leader a
little<00:00:20.130> bit<00:00:20.220> more<00:00:20.400> muscle<00:00:20.609> let's<00:00:21.119> check<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
little bit more muscle let's check it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:33.640 
little bit more muscle let's check it
out

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.810 

now<00:00:34.650> we<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.800> wait<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.370> should<00:00:35.520> send<00:00:35.700> the

now we just wait you should send the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.660 
now we just wait you should send the
results<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.329> makes<00:00:36.510> 24<00:00:37.020> hours<00:00:37.379> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.430> will

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
results that makes 24 hours and I will

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
results that makes 24 hours and I will
compare<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.540> result<00:00:40.010> let's<00:00:41.010> see

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
compare it to the first result let's see

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.780 
compare it to the first result let's see
what<00:00:41.280> happened

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
what happened

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.080 
what happened
see<00:00:42.829> all<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> results<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
see all right I get the results in you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.780 
see all right I get the results in you
look<00:00:45.360> let's<00:00:45.720> check<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.080> out

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.250 

all<00:00:53.790> right<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.089> here<00:00:54.269> we<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.540> here<00:00:55.339> we<00:00:56.339> have

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
all right so here we go so here we have

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.600 
all right so here we go so here we have
October<00:00:58.260> 17th<00:00:58.800> my<00:00:59.790> igf-1<00:01:00.449> level<00:01:01.110> was<00:01:02.070> 107<00:01:04.610> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
October 17th my igf-1 level was 107 and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.649 
October 17th my igf-1 level was 107 and
then<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.000> week<00:01:06.240> later<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> 24th<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
then one week later on the 24th of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
then one week later on the 24th of
October<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:11.220> was<00:01:11.930> 1:30<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.350> IGF<00:01:13.830> went<00:01:14.460> from

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
October it was 1:30 so my IGF went from

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.859 
October it was 1:30 so my IGF went from
107<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.510> 130

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
107 to 130

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.500 
107 to 130
okay<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.260> add<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> results<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.729> 130

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
okay so let's add up the results so 130

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.020 
okay so let's add up the results so 130
/<00:01:22.110> 107<00:01:22.729> it's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.880> 22<00:01:24.510> percent<00:01:24.780> increase<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
/ 107 it's a 22 percent increase so and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.590 
/ 107 it's a 22 percent increase so and
he's<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.600> seven<00:01:28.110> days<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:29.220> igf-1<00:01:29.820> levels<00:01:30.030> went

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
he's in seven days my igf-1 levels went

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530 
he's in seven days my igf-1 levels went
up<00:01:30.920> 22%<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.700> significant<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
up 22% that's really significant and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
up 22% that's really significant and
what<00:01:33.690> that<00:01:33.900> means<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.530> growth<00:01:34.800> hormone

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
what that means is my growth hormone

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.850 
what that means is my growth hormone
levels<00:01:35.250> went<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.910> because<00:01:36.660> it's<00:01:36.870> igf-1<00:01:37.590> levels

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
levels went up because it's igf-1 levels

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.430 
levels went up because it's igf-1 levels
are<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> better<00:01:38.880> indicator<00:01:39.540> than<00:01:40.080> anything

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
are a better indicator than anything

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.100 
are a better indicator than anything
else<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.240> anti-aging<00:01:42.780> doctor

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
else when you go to an anti-aging doctor

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
else when you go to an anti-aging doctor
don't<00:01:43.320> test<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.710> igf-1<00:01:44.310> levels<00:01:44.550> so<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
don't test your igf-1 levels so that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.090 
don't test your igf-1 levels so that
they<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.260> your<00:01:46.440> growth<00:01:46.680> hormone

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
they know what your growth hormone

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.690 
they know what your growth hormone
levels<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.800> basically<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.460> higher

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
levels are at so basically the higher

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
levels are at so basically the higher
your<00:01:50.940> igf-1<00:01:51.420> levels<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.409> higher<00:01:52.650> growth

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
your igf-1 levels are the higher growth

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.120 
your igf-1 levels are the higher growth
hormone<00:01:53.430> levels<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.720> our<00:01:55.290> challenge<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.010> you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
hormone levels so our challenge to you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.230 
hormone levels so our challenge to you
is<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.490> try<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.590> GH<00:01:58.590> Maximizer<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.940> gh
