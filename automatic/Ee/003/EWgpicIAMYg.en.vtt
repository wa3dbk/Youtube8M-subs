00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
back side through I actually pull a

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.600 
back side through I actually pull a
little<00:00:52.119> bit<00:00:52.360> pull<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.290> make<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.070> small<00:00:54.400> loop

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
little bit pull it make a small loop

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.869 
little bit pull it make a small loop
there<00:00:54.879> change<00:00:55.540> hands<00:00:56.110> take<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.220> tag<00:00:57.430> in<00:00:57.699> and

there change hands take the tag in and
pull<00:00:58.089> another<00:00:58.330> loop<00:00:58.420> down<00:00:58.780> once<00:00:59.769> that's<00:01:00.070> done

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
pull another loop down once that's done

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.070 
pull another loop down once that's done
I<00:01:00.369> grab<00:01:00.820> both<00:01:01.119> the<00:01:01.299> ends<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.600> line<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
I grab both the ends of the line and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.829 
I grab both the ends of the line and
pull<00:01:02.379> opposite<00:01:03.070> directions<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.820> simply<00:01:04.600> drop

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
pull opposite directions and simply drop

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.539

your<00:01:05.049> jig<00:01:05.320> it's<00:01:05.560> going<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.860> look<00:01:05.979> like<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.220> mess

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
your jig it's going to look like a mess

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.609 
your jig it's going to look like a mess
but<00:01:07.240> if<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.450> pull<00:01:07.689> both<00:01:07.900> directions<00:01:08.260> it's

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
but if you pull both directions it's

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.959 
but if you pull both directions it's
going<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.799> pull<00:01:09.009> down<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.340> be<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> real<00:01:09.729> nice

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
going to pull down to be a real nice

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
dropped it start pulling it and once I

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.740 
dropped it start pulling it and once I
get<00:01:14.560> there<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.829> don't<00:01:14.979> cinch<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.820> just<00:01:16.600> reach

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
get there I don't cinch it I just reach

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.469 
get there I don't cinch it I just reach
down<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:16.990> grab<00:01:17.289> my<00:01:17.560> jig<00:01:17.969> pull<00:01:18.969> both<00:01:19.210> lines

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
down and grab my jig pull both lines

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.690 
down and grab my jig pull both lines
together<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:20.259> you'll<00:01:20.740> see<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.100> knot<00:01:21.280> form

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
together and you'll see the knot form

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.609 
together and you'll see the knot form
and<00:01:22.149> it<00:01:22.659> usually<00:01:22.929> will<00:01:23.259> come<00:01:23.439> out

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
and it usually will come out

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.560 
and it usually will come out
approximately<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> 3/4<00:01:24.939> ton<00:01:25.119> in<00:01:25.299> its<00:01:25.390> loop

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
approximately of a 3/4 ton in its loop

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.289 
approximately of a 3/4 ton in its loop
now<00:01:26.289> why<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.590> use<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.979> loop<00:01:27.310> knot<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.759> something<00:01:28.179> I

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
now why I use a loop knot is something I

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.209 
now why I use a loop knot is something I
want<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.689> really<00:01:28.899> look<00:01:29.140> at<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.920> bait

right now looks like it's hanging
vertical<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.979> basically<00:01:33.789> I'm<00:01:33.999> using

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
vertical and basically I'm using

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.169 
vertical and basically I'm using
artificial<00:01:34.929> bait<00:01:35.079> i<00:01:35.109> jig<00:01:35.499> fish<00:01:35.740> around<00:01:36.219> and<00:01:36.609> so

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
artificial bait i jig fish around and so

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.149 
artificial bait i jig fish around and so
what<00:01:37.359> I'm<00:01:37.509> doing<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.929> imitating<00:01:38.499> live<00:01:38.799> bait

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
what I'm doing is imitating live bait

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.789 
what I'm doing is imitating live bait
and<00:01:39.429> I've<00:01:40.179> learned<00:01:40.509> over<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.960> years<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
and I've learned over the years that the

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.889 
and I've learned over the years that the
crippled<00:01:42.310> shad<00:01:42.579> are<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.090> cripple<00:01:43.479> minnows

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
crippled shad are the cripple minnows

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.359 
crippled shad are the cripple minnows
are<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.170> ones<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.590> your<00:01:44.740> fish<00:01:45.009> are<00:01:45.159> going<00:01:45.280> to

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
are the ones that your fish are going to

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.080 
are the ones that your fish are going to
attack<00:01:45.490> first<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.420> by<00:01:47.079> tying<00:01:47.499> a<00:01:47.679> loop<00:01:47.859> knot

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
attack first and by tying a loop knot

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.399 
attack first and by tying a loop knot
basically<00:01:49.090> I<00:01:49.119> have<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.569> of<00:01:49.749> injured<00:01:50.200> bait

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
basically I have got of injured bait

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.559 
basically I have got of injured bait
here<00:01:50.799> now<00:01:51.310> your<00:01:51.549> if<00:01:51.850> you're<00:01:51.999> worried<00:01:52.329> about<00:01:52.359> it

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
here now your if you're worried about it

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.599 
here now your if you're worried about it
hanging<00:01:52.960> wrong<00:01:53.170> as<00:01:53.649> soon<00:01:53.889> as<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.100> put<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.399> in

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
hanging wrong as soon as you put this in

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.910 
hanging wrong as soon as you put this in
the<00:01:54.700> water<00:01:54.909> this<00:01:55.509> thing<00:01:55.569> levels<00:01:56.229> out<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:56.740> just

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the water this thing levels out and just

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.919 
the water this thing levels out and just
freely<00:01:57.460> floats<00:01:57.789> in<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:57.999> water<00:01:58.090> giving<00:01:58.749> you<00:01:58.869> a

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
freely floats in the water giving you a

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.080 
freely floats in the water giving you a
natural<00:01:59.560> reaction<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.280> what<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> fish<00:02:00.759> is<00:02:00.909> going

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
natural reaction of what a fish is going

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.330 
natural reaction of what a fish is going
to<00:02:01.149> be<00:02:01.240> doing<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.749> then<00:02:02.380> by<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.619> working<00:02:03.189> your

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
to be doing and then by you working your

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.999 
to be doing and then by you working your
jig<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> tip<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:04.929> your<00:02:05.049> rod<00:02:05.229> or<00:02:05.530> by<00:02:05.649> popping

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
jig with a tip of your rod or by popping

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.590 
jig with a tip of your rod or by popping
your<00:02:06.130> line<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.310> little<00:02:06.549> bit<00:02:06.670> what<00:02:07.209> I'm<00:02:07.329> creating

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
your line a little bit what I'm creating

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.930 
your line a little bit what I'm creating
is<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:07.959> cripple<00:02:08.380> bait<00:02:08.560> that's<00:02:08.800> jumps<00:02:09.490> up<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
is a cripple bait that's jumps up and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.420 
is a cripple bait that's jumps up and
it'll<00:02:10.179> fall<00:02:10.360> back<00:02:10.660> jumps<00:02:11.650> up<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.220> falls

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it'll fall back jumps up and it falls

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.880 
it'll fall back jumps up and it falls
back<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.450> can<00:02:13.630> only<00:02:13.810> do<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.140> with<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.590> good

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
back you can only do that with a good

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.130 
back you can only do that with a good
loop<00:02:15.100> knob<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.060> tie<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.570> cinch<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> down

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
loop knob if I tie it and cinch it down

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840 
loop knob if I tie it and cinch it down
you<00:02:17.800> take<00:02:18.070> your<00:02:18.220> jig<00:02:18.490> out<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
you take your jig out of the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.610 
you take your jig out of the
out<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.330> your<00:02:19.450> fish's<00:02:19.780> mouth<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.990> lot<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.410> times

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
out of your fish's mouth a lot of times

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
that tied and cinch knots going to be up

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.930 
that tied and cinch knots going to be up
on<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> end<00:02:23.140> or<00:02:23.440> it'll<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.580> and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
on the end or it'll be on the back and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.160 
on the end or it'll be on the back and
your<00:02:25.030> baits<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> be<00:02:25.630> hanging<00:02:25.990> wrong

your baits going to be hanging wrong

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.830 
your baits going to be hanging wrong
this<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.280> gives<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.640> natural<00:02:27.880> flotation<00:02:28.720> in

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
this is gives you a natural flotation in

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.420 
this is gives you a natural flotation in
the<00:02:28.930> water<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.650> you're<00:02:29.830> gonna<00:02:29.920> catch<00:02:30.190> more

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the water and you're gonna catch more

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
the water and you're gonna catch more
fish<00:02:30.610> doing<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.600> more<00:02:31.780> time<00:02:32.020> I'm<00:02:32.320> going<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
fish doing it one more time I'm going to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.170 
fish doing it one more time I'm going to
show<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.890> different<00:02:33.370> night<00:02:33.520> it's<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.940> loop

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
show you a different night it's a loop

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.070 
show you a different night it's a loop
not<00:02:34.390> another<00:02:35.080> way<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.380> tying<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.890> hang<00:02:36.400> on

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.340 

cut<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.230> off<00:02:41.500> real<00:02:41.710> quick<00:02:46.020> we'll<00:02:47.020> take<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
cut this off real quick we'll take the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.780 
cut this off real quick we'll take the
same<00:02:47.590> bait<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.830> what<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.190> lot<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.550> the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
same bait this is what a lot of the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
same bait this is what a lot of the
beginning<00:02:52.300> fishermen<00:02:52.690> will<00:02:52.870> use<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
beginning fishermen will use and it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.500 
beginning fishermen will use and it
works<00:02:53.710> just<00:02:54.100> fine<00:02:54.340> running<00:02:55.240> through<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
works just fine running through the I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.950 
works just fine running through the I
make<00:02:58.510> one<00:02:58.900> loop<00:02:59.170> and<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:01.330> take<00:03:01.540> your<00:03:01.720> bait

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
make one loop and then take your bait

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.500 
make one loop and then take your bait
and<00:03:02.260> running<00:03:03.220> through<00:03:03.430> three<00:03:03.850> or<00:03:04.000> four<00:03:04.180> times

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and running through three or four times

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.490 
and running through three or four times
the<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:07.180> good<00:03:07.390> thing<00:03:07.600> about<00:03:07.840> doing<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.440> is

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the the good thing about doing this is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.800 
the the good thing about doing this is
allows<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.370> make<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.760> little<00:03:10.270> loop<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
allows you to make that little loop a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.350 
allows you to make that little loop a
little<00:03:10.990> bit<00:03:11.200> smaller<00:03:11.640> by<00:03:12.640> just<00:03:12.910> doing<00:03:13.240> that

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
little bit smaller by just doing that

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.970 
little bit smaller by just doing that
right<00:03:13.570> there<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:14.020> actually<00:03:14.320> just<00:03:14.620> pull

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
right there I can actually just pull

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.730 
right there I can actually just pull
that<00:03:15.220> loop<00:03:15.660> down<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.260> wherever<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
that loop down and make it wherever I

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.100 
that loop down and make it wherever I
want<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:18.570> can<00:03:19.570> make<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.840> smaller<00:03:20.520> from<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:22.110> jig

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
want I can make it smaller from the jig

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.660 
want I can make it smaller from the jig
head<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.210> still<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> same<00:03:26.020> lot<00:03:26.670> cut

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
head and I still have the same lot cut

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.510 
head and I still have the same lot cut
your<00:03:27.850> tag<00:03:28.060> off<00:03:28.300> about<00:03:28.630> an<00:03:28.750> eighth<00:03:28.870> inch<00:03:28.900> away

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
your tag off about an eighth inch away

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.920 
your tag off about an eighth inch away
set<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.550> hook<00:03:30.880> hard<00:03:30.940> on<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.420> fish<00:03:31.630> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
set the hook hard on the fish that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.020 
set the hook hard on the fish that
cinches<00:03:32.410> down<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:33.070> you're<00:03:33.550> definitely<00:03:33.730> going
