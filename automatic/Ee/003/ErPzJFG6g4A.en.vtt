00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.830
 Visconde has been looking for space to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.499
 try to overtake 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.869
 This one for me is also unpublished marcelo 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.909
 frank to strong beat if a test 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.130
 interrupted with red flag already 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:19.109
 there was movement of Marcelo Franco 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.429
 the image that I asked to see for a 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 fraction of seconds 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.300
 It's on the earth screen for you. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 Thank you Marcelo the concern of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 marcelo franco see only what is the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 pilot's instinct the first thing that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.310
 he cared to do after 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 to pass the biggest scare of his career 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.300
 was to warn the world that everything is okay 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 with it a spectacular image as they have 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.390
 been the images of Saturday here in 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180
 interlagos 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.269
 the marcelo franc after the touch 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 several times in the descent of the 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.609
 lake during the rollover a beat 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.859
 very strong against tire protection is 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.460
 to assume that the pilot may have 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.410
 suffered some injury so it was 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.800
 tell the world it was all right 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 with him there he is not standing him is a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.360
 image that really scared everybody 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.820
 mainly by the amount of cargo 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 times the car has turned and the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 fact that he went straight to the wall 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
 depending on the angle at which the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.270
 car crashes you never know what you can 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.870
 But Marcelo Franco is there. 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.460
 walking looks is able to do on the board 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.530
 by his posture is able to make a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.990
 to make my bed 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.560
 present to him speech look what I was going to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.220
 to be ugly 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.170
 There must be photographers on the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.689
 area but the image of the television he 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.460
 something is going to be done do not doubt 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.460
 the touch with sÃ©rgio lateral ribas 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.500
 strange to the leverage that the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.560
 touch caused in the car but watch a two 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 three years counting four do not miss the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.189
 account 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.250
 On Wednesday the car rolled over 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.000
 on the contrary hit the tire protection 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 sky boy this gives a scare in the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.190
 people look is seeing knowing that everything is 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.440
 Right with him I come to despair 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.690
 seeing the image of what has just 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.560
 happen with marcelo franco pilot of the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.560
 rio de janeiro
