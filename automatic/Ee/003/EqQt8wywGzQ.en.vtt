00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it feels a little different from the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
it feels a little different from the
regular<00:00:41.809> cube<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.969> every<00:00:44.969> time<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.360> turn<00:00:45.570> it

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
regular cube and every time you turn it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.729 
regular cube and every time you turn it
this<00:00:46.200> core<00:00:47.539> plastic<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.809> bends<00:00:49.940> like<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:52.100> um

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
this core plastic it bends like that um

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
this core plastic it bends like that um
yeah<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.730> bends<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.719> um<00:01:00.320> does<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
yeah so it bends like that um does that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.070 
yeah so it bends like that um does that
with<00:01:01.680> every<00:01:02.010> side

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080
