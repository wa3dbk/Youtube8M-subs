00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
are banned so clearly they must wield a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.969 
are banned so clearly they must wield a
power<00:03:21.000> far<00:03:21.750> greater<00:03:21.780> than<00:03:22.199> royal<00:03:22.650> decrees

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
power far greater than royal decrees

power far greater than royal decrees
right<00:03:23.250> well<00:03:24.120> maybe<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.229> mean<00:03:25.680> royal<00:03:26.069> oppression

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579

right well maybe I mean royal oppression
is<00:03:26.759> much<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.180> solar<00:03:27.389> drain<00:03:27.629> it<00:03:27.870> only<00:03:28.019> stops

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
is much like solar drain it only stops

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.110 
is much like solar drain it only stops
one<00:03:28.650> small<00:03:28.949> element<00:03:29.159> special<00:03:29.849> summoning

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
one small element special summoning

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.879 
one small element special summoning
monsters<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.959> doesn't<00:03:31.259> stop<00:03:31.409> the<00:03:31.530> monsters

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
monsters it doesn't stop the monsters

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.349 
monsters it doesn't stop the monsters
from<00:03:32.009> doing<00:03:32.310> whatever<00:03:32.489> else<00:03:32.819> they<00:03:32.970> want<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.239> do

from doing whatever else they want to do

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.300 
from doing whatever else they want to do

attack with them you can use flips

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.349 
attack with them you can use flips
effects<00:03:37.949> with<00:03:38.129> them<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.430> doesn't<00:03:38.579> matter<00:03:38.879> you

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
know we won't go into a great detail

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.550 
know we won't go into a great detail
about<00:03:41.250> oppression<00:03:41.879> because<00:03:42.030> that's<00:03:42.900> kind<00:03:43.409> of

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
about oppression because that's kind of

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.110 
about oppression because that's kind of
debatable<00:03:44.069> whether<00:03:44.189> that<00:03:44.579> card<00:03:44.849> should<00:03:45.000> be

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
debatable whether that card should be

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.550 
debatable whether that card should be
banned<00:03:45.389> or<00:03:45.509> not<00:03:45.689> and<00:03:45.900> that's<00:03:46.259> a<00:03:46.409> whole

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
banned or not and that's a whole

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.409 
banned or not and that's a whole
different<00:03:46.949> topic<00:03:46.979> I'm<00:03:47.669> just<00:03:47.970> gonna<00:03:48.090> talk

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
different topic I'm just gonna talk

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.149 
different topic I'm just gonna talk
about<00:03:48.569> how<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.319> that<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> car<00:03:49.919> actually

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
about how much that the car actually

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.610 
about how much that the car actually
stops<00:03:50.759> now<00:03:51.359> impairing<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.019> order<00:03:52.349> on<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
stops now impairing the order on the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.379 
stops now impairing the order on the
other<00:03:52.769> hand<00:03:52.949> is<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.129> far<00:03:53.609> different<00:03:53.849> beast

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
other hand is a far different beast

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.270 
other hand is a far different beast
that's<00:03:54.780> that's<00:03:55.139> pretty<00:03:55.560> much<00:03:55.799> just<00:03:56.129> like

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that's that's pretty much just like

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.969 
that's that's pretty much just like
royal<00:03:56.549> decree<00:03:56.909> where<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.599> stops<00:03:57.989> one-third<00:03:58.769> of

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
royal decree where it stops one-third of

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.789 
royal decree where it stops one-third of
cards<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.459> stops<00:03:59.729> all<00:04:00.000> spells<00:04:00.840> way<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.439> power

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
cards it stops all spells way to power

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.379 
cards it stops all spells way to power
for<00:04:02.099> my<00:04:02.250> opinion<00:04:02.699> so<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.879> think<00:04:02.939> that<00:04:03.180> most

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
for my opinion so I think that most

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.479 
for my opinion so I think that most
people<00:04:03.810> would<00:04:03.989> agree<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.620> Imperial<00:04:05.159> Order

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
people would agree that Imperial Order

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.520 
people would agree that Imperial Order
is<00:04:05.639> justifiably<00:04:06.329> banned<00:04:06.599> now<00:04:07.139> I<00:04:07.199> would<00:04:07.379> say

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
is justifiably banned now I would say

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.709 
is justifiably banned now I would say
that<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.799> best<00:04:08.159> argument<00:04:08.819> for<00:04:08.879> Imperial

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
that the best argument for Imperial

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.199 
that the best argument for Imperial
Order<00:04:10.079> warranting<00:04:10.889> a<00:04:10.979> ban<00:04:11.189> over<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.699> car<00:04:11.969> like

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
Order warranting a ban over a car like

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.119 
Order warranting a ban over a car like
royal<00:04:12.479> decree<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:13.199> the<00:04:13.469> fact<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:13.949> can

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
royal decree is the fact that you can

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.860 
royal decree is the fact that you can
turn<00:04:14.310> off<00:04:14.519> until<00:04:14.789> your<00:04:14.939> order<00:04:15.239> whenever<00:04:15.629> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
turn off until your order whenever the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.449 
turn off until your order whenever the
hell<00:04:16.019> you<00:04:16.139> will

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
hell you will

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.430 
hell you will

car trooper I got attacked or something
like<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.120> but<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.110> thing<00:04:30.139> about<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.830> is

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
like that but the thing about this is

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.960 
like that but the thing about this is
and<00:04:31.460> it's<00:04:31.819> cold<00:04:32.259> we<00:04:33.259> still<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:34.039> trap<00:04:34.940> that

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
and it's cold we still have a trap that

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.600 
and it's cold we still have a trap that
turns<00:04:35.419> off<00:04:35.630> all<00:04:35.900> spells<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:37.490> is

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
turns off all spells and that is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.120 
turns off all spells and that is
banned<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.840> we<00:04:38.960> have<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> trap<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.500> turns<00:04:39.949> off

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
banned but we have a trap that turns off

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.850 
banned but we have a trap that turns off
all<00:04:40.340> traps<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:41.000> it's<00:04:41.300> unlimited<00:04:41.650> like<00:04:42.650> how

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
all traps and it's unlimited like how

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.920 
all traps and it's unlimited like how
does<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.160> make<00:04:43.310> any<00:04:43.910> sense<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.750> on

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
does that make any sense just on

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.529 
does that make any sense just on
impact<00:04:45.500> on<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.949> game<00:04:46.130> alone<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.970> makes<00:04:47.240> no

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
impact on the game alone it makes no

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.330 
impact on the game alone it makes no

a thing to activate and negate all traps
it<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:25.039> free<00:05:25.460> now<00:05:25.880> some<00:05:26.150> people<00:05:26.300> out<00:05:26.599> there<00:05:26.840> I

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
it is free now some people out there I

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.749 
it is free now some people out there I
would<00:05:27.289> not<00:05:27.320> be<00:05:27.620> one<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:27.860> them<00:05:27.979> could<00:05:28.370> even<00:05:28.520> make

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
would not be one of them could even make

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.999 
would not be one of them could even make
the<00:05:28.880> argument<00:05:29.389> that<00:05:29.479> royal<00:05:30.320> decree<00:05:30.740> being

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
the argument that royal decree being

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.740 
the argument that royal decree being
free<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.370> not<00:05:31.789> costing<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.240> Life<00:05:32.539> Points

free and not costing you Life Points

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.260 
free and not costing you Life Points
every<00:05:33.259> single<00:05:33.620> time<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.800> you<00:05:34.039> negate<00:05:34.880> a<00:05:34.909> trap

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
every single time that you negate a trap

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.330 
every single time that you negate a trap
is<00:05:35.509> actually<00:05:36.020> equivalent<00:05:36.380> to<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.979> fact<00:05:37.159> that

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
is actually equivalent to the fact that

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.490 
is actually equivalent to the fact that
impair<00:05:38.090> your<00:05:38.120> order<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.870> can<00:05:38.900> stop<00:05:39.289> paying

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
impair your order you can stop paying

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.899 
impair your order you can stop paying
whatever<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.949> hell<00:05:40.070> you<00:05:40.190> want<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.550> don't<00:05:40.610> think

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
whatever the hell you want I don't think

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.550 
whatever the hell you want I don't think
that<00:05:41.030> those<00:05:41.150> things<00:05:41.389> are<00:05:41.690> equivalent<00:05:41.990> but<00:05:42.409> I

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
that those things are equivalent but I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.310 
that those things are equivalent but I
can<00:05:43.009> at<00:05:43.130> least<00:05:43.210> understand<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.389> argument<00:05:44.599> so

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
can at least understand that argument so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.379 
can at least understand that argument so
when<00:05:45.469> I<00:05:45.530> look<00:05:45.710> at<00:05:45.889> royal<00:05:46.099> decree<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.729> see<00:05:47.030> a<00:05:47.060> card

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
when I look at royal decree I see a card

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.719 
when I look at royal decree I see a card
that<00:05:47.539> stops<00:05:47.870> one-third<00:05:48.680> of<00:05:48.830> cards<00:05:49.219> main<00:05:49.490> the

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
that stops one-third of cards main the

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.360 
that stops one-third of cards main the
three<00:05:49.940> basic<00:05:50.360> types<00:05:50.509> anyway<00:05:50.960> monster<00:05:51.770> spell

three basic types anyway monster spell

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.760 
three basic types anyway monster spell
and<00:05:52.610> trap<00:05:52.909> I<00:05:53.270> see<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.810> card<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.169> has<00:05:54.380> a<00:05:54.409> much

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
and trap I see a card that has a much

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.670 
and trap I see a card that has a much
bigger<00:05:55.219> impact<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.330> game<00:05:56.570> than<00:05:57.349> a<00:05:57.380> card

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
bigger impact on the game than a card

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.950 
bigger impact on the game than a card
like<00:05:57.770> soil<00:05:58.219> drain<00:05:58.610> or<00:05:58.909> dimensional<00:05:59.479> fissure<00:05:59.690> I

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
like soil drain or dimensional fissure I

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.899 
like soil drain or dimensional fissure I
see<00:06:00.199> a<00:06:00.229> card<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.530> has<00:06:00.650> no<00:06:01.070> life<00:06:01.370> point<00:06:01.669> cost

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
see a card that has no life point cost

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.290 
see a card that has no life point cost
attached<00:06:02.630> to<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.050> and<00:06:03.169> it's<00:06:03.770> unlimited<00:06:04.310> why

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
attached to it and it's unlimited why

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.209 
attached to it and it's unlimited why
these<00:06:05.360> other<00:06:05.750> cards<00:06:06.139> are<00:06:06.259> either<00:06:06.409> banned<00:06:06.889> or

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
these other cards are either banned or

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.520 
these other cards are either banned or
limited<00:06:07.610> and<00:06:07.789> it<00:06:07.880> makes<00:06:08.090> no<00:06:08.210> sense<00:06:08.509> to<00:06:09.110> me<00:06:09.259> so

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
limited and it makes no sense to me so

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.700 
limited and it makes no sense to me so
again<00:06:10.520> I'm<00:06:11.000> not<00:06:11.389> saying<00:06:11.659> that<00:06:11.990> royal<00:06:12.259> decree

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
again I'm not saying that royal decree

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.820 
again I'm not saying that royal decree
is<00:06:13.190> like<00:06:13.550> an<00:06:13.789> absolute<00:06:14.360> bane<00:06:14.719> on<00:06:15.110> you<00:06:15.500> know<00:06:15.620> the
