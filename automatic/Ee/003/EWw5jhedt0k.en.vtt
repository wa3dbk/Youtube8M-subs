00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
to what you played before I think I

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.389 
to what you played before I think I
think<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.290> feels<00:01:01.469> nice<00:01:01.620> overall<00:01:02.130> I<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
think it feels nice overall I like the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
think it feels nice overall I like the
cymbals<00:01:02.880> cymbals<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.360> definitely<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> lot

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
cymbals cymbals are definitely a lot

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
cymbals cymbals are definitely a lot
better<00:01:04.049> than<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> plastic<00:01:04.469> in<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:05.009> opinion<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
better than the plastic in my opinion I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
better than the plastic in my opinion I
think<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.850> gives<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> real<00:01:06.570> feel<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
think it gives you the real feel of a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660 
think it gives you the real feel of a
cymbal<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> bounce<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> symbol<00:01:08.549> which

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
cymbal and the bounce of a symbol which

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.660 
cymbal and the bounce of a symbol which
i<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.330> nice<00:01:12.229> okay

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
i think is really nice okay

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.020 
i think is really nice okay
having<00:01:14.670> said<00:01:14.940> that<00:01:16.070> there<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.520> last<00:01:17.729> release

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
i think they call the one of the plastic

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.140 
i think they call the one of the plastic
cymbals<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.280> nice<00:01:23.460> thing<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.000> it

a program called BFD the lite version

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.959 
a program called BFD the lite version
which<00:02:23.900> only<00:02:24.079> has<00:02:24.260> like<00:02:24.409> one<00:02:24.650> kit<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.939> can

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
which only has like one kit and you can

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.209 
which only has like one kit and you can

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
put it into any computer now having said

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.819 
put it into any computer now having said
any<00:02:28.459> computer<00:02:28.939> it<00:02:29.150> can't<00:02:29.359> be<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.840> ancient<00:02:30.379> or

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
any computer it can't be like ancient or

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.709 
any computer it can't be like ancient or
it's<00:02:30.950> not<00:02:31.099> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> run<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.599> it

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
it's not going to run it I I have it

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.319 
it's not going to run it I I have it
running<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:33.200> my<00:02:33.409> studio<00:02:33.769> on<00:02:34.129> a<00:02:36.219> g3<00:02:37.219> Mac<00:02:37.909> Mini

running in my studio on a g3 Mac Mini

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.800 
running in my studio on a g3 Mac Mini
but<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.079> barely<00:02:39.469> runs<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.189> mean<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.659> just

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
but it barely runs I mean it it just

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.250 
but it barely runs I mean it it just
barely<00:02:42.109> runs<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> look<00:02:45.049> at<00:02:45.139> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
barely runs so if you look at the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.349 
barely runs so if you look at the
controls<00:02:45.769> here<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.189> front<00:02:46.519> you've<00:02:47.090> got<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
controls here on the front you've got a

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.559 
controls here on the front you've got a
tremendous<00:02:48.019> amount<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.849> control<00:02:49.849> you<00:02:50.389> can

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
tremendous amount of control you can

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.899 
tremendous amount of control you can
look<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.650> need<00:02:51.799> everything<00:02:52.099> from<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
look at you need everything from the

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.640 
look at you need everything from the
trigger<00:02:55.909> MIDI<00:02:56.180> channel<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.169> trigger<00:02:57.379> MIDI

note<00:02:57.889> number<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> then<00:02:58.939> you<00:02:59.030> really<00:02:59.389> get<00:02:59.540> into

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
note number and then you really get into

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.300 
note number and then you really get into
setting<00:03:00.079> up<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.319> actual<00:03:00.439> trigger<00:03:00.859> trigger

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310

Reed<00:03:04.790> triggering<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> actual<00:03:05.930> trigger

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
Reed triggering and the actual trigger

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.559 
Reed triggering and the actual trigger
type<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:07.519> which<00:03:07.669> can<00:03:07.909> be<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> problem<00:03:08.299> when

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
type but which can be a problem when

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.580 
type but which can be a problem when
we're<00:03:08.689> setting<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.019> up<00:03:09.049> here<00:03:09.230> earlier<00:03:09.439> before

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
we're setting it up here earlier before

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.039 
we're setting it up here earlier before
I<00:03:09.769> know<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.159> had<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:11.450> had<00:03:11.569> some<00:03:11.750> problems<00:03:12.019> with

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
I know we had we had some problems with

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.020 
I know we had we had some problems with
the<00:03:12.169> bass<00:03:12.349> drum<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.730> we've<00:03:13.819> got

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
the bass drum and I think we've got

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.250 
the bass drum and I think we've got
those<00:03:14.169> mostly<00:03:15.169> taken<00:03:15.500> care<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.769> now<00:03:16.159> but<00:03:17.260> I

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
those mostly taken care of now but I

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.879 
those mostly taken care of now but I
would<00:03:18.560> say<00:03:19.449> ahead<00:03:20.449> I've<00:03:20.989> only<00:03:21.169> used<00:03:21.290> two<00:03:21.680> or

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
would say ahead I've only used two or

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.349 
would say ahead I've only used two or
trying<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.220> kits<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.579> my<00:03:22.699> life<00:03:22.849> you<00:03:23.030> guys<00:03:23.180> have

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
trying to kits in my life you guys have

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.059 
trying to kits in my life you guys have
used<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.629> lot<00:03:23.720> more<00:03:23.780> than<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.139> but<00:03:24.199> especially

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
used a lot more than this but especially

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.009 
used a lot more than this but especially
given<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.669> price<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.329> this<00:03:26.750> thing

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.319 

yeah<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.189> by<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.819> way<00:03:32.000> they<00:03:32.209> have

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
yeah and and by the way they have

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.119 
yeah and and by the way they have
released<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.780> new<00:03:32.810> unit<00:03:33.290> since<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.739> one<00:03:33.919> came

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
released a new unit since this one came

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.140 
released a new unit since this one came
out<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.790> has<00:03:35.299> all<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.680> sounds<00:03:37.430> for<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
out that has all of the sounds for the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.170 
out that has all of the sounds for the
BFG<00:03:38.599> light<00:03:38.870> built<00:03:39.859> into<00:03:40.159> the<00:03:40.250> head<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.060> can

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
BFG light built into the head so you can

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.210 
BFG light built into the head so you can
come<00:03:41.359> out<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.810> head<00:03:41.989> right<00:03:42.229> into<00:03:42.439> audio

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
come out of the head right into audio

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.890 
come out of the head right into audio
and<00:03:43.609> not<00:03:43.729> have<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.000> worry<00:03:44.180> about<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.509> computer

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and not have to worry about the computer

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.960 
and not have to worry about the computer
side<00:03:45.109> of<00:03:45.139> it<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.500> get<00:03:45.620> those<00:03:45.859> good<00:03:46.669> to<00:03:46.819> get

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
side of it and get those good to get

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.390 
side of it and get those good to get
those<00:03:47.120> those<00:03:47.540> sounds<00:03:48.049> without<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.949> extra

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
those those sounds without the extra

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.360 
those those sounds without the extra
part<00:03:49.669> with<00:03:50.419> anything<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.989> has<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> lot<00:03:52.040> of

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
part with anything that has a lot of

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.189 
part with anything that has a lot of
capability<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.359> a<00:03:53.449> lot<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.659> flexibility

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
capability and a lot of flexibility

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.920 
capability and a lot of flexibility
you're<00:03:54.739> going<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.189> have<00:03:55.400> some<00:03:56.329> complexity

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
you're going to have some complexity

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.530 
you're going to have some complexity
it's<00:03:57.409> just<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.799> way<00:03:57.949> it<00:03:58.069> is<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:58.639> the<00:03:59.239> added

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it's just the way it is so the added

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.879 
it's just the way it is so the added
complexity<00:03:59.959> here<00:04:00.199> lets<00:04:00.439> you<00:04:00.500> do<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.650> lot<00:04:00.859> more

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
complexity here lets you do a lot more

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.869 
complexity here lets you do a lot more
so<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.459> think<00:04:02.120> overall<00:04:02.659> if<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.199> had<00:04:03.349> for<00:04:04.310> me<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.819> I

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
so I think overall if I had for me I I

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.179 
so I think overall if I had for me I I
got<00:04:05.629> this<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.079> have<00:04:06.229> in<00:04:06.349> my<00:04:06.470> studio<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:06.979> we<00:04:07.069> can

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
got this to have in my studio so we can

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.129 
got this to have in my studio so we can
do<00:04:07.280> silent<00:04:07.699> rehearsals<00:04:08.239> with<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.659> band<00:04:08.870> and

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
do silent rehearsals with the band and

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.499 
do silent rehearsals with the band and
it's<00:04:09.470> worked<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.009> mean<00:04:10.669> for<00:04:10.819> me<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.000> would<00:04:11.359> give

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
it's worked I mean for me I would give
