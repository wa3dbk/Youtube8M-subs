00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 not the final of the grand prix 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.280
 and won the europe championship that before 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.549
 yesterday he dazzled us with that triple axel and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440
 that wonderful short program that made 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.550
 has a very settled head you see very 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.690
 quiet and right now it has everything 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.690
 to win the world title 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.369
 the first jump of the triple lutz program 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.369
 combined with double all double loop 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.900
 I do with a little step and better left 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.970
 said triple-double all a double look 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.570
 also the nerves are in a final 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.570
 of the world 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.610
 second triple lots 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.890
 it has saved triple flip very stop the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890
 exit 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.970
 two pirouettes in a row to leave more 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.970
 jumps in the second part of the program 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.610
 and now comes another combination of jumps 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.610
 difficult a triple two triple ton 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.530
 it needs great speed 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.050
 one 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.570
 with second 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 and you notice those nerves javi too 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.010
 with double 3 in between 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.340
 the triple loop and thus be more secure 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.140
 triple arches and double double to shell in 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.140
 sequence 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.810
 and we are here doing accounts of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.850
 how much I needed but she is already 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 put in work has already gotten well 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.160
 well well in the final part already changes 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.160
 the face 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.959
 choreographic sequence 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.420
 and last pirouette of the program 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.780
 look at technique 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.110
 as you notice the nerves in the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.120
 first part of the program has not been 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.860
 perfect has not been perfect but 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.740
 evidently in the nerves of the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.680
 first part of the program they have been able 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.629
 I had to tie the gold look at the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.879
 Oral technical scoring will adjust but 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.310
 it is already above the touched that is the 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.999
 that is first came for the gold 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.999
 I'm leaving today 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.199
 in the second part of the program has 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:53.199
 been much more comfortable 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.300
 and that the second part of the program 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.990
 she includes many jumps also for 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 earn some bonus 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.169
 see where they go with that to see if it's going 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.349
 it 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.220
 rigid mother must be those of the factory 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:16.150
 of dolls because they exist that is 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.150
 what a barbarian 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.909
 this will allow you to pick up normally pick 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.550
 but one at least they always take 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.220
 Y 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.310
 a program a little more imprecise than the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.400
 short program of course but has not 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.590
 left no element out even though 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.990
 done two double three is in the first and 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.200
 in the other combination here is 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.750
 that is double 3 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.710
 and he has known combining 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.249
 so as not to lose those points 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.499
 her maximum claim was to add 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:59.319
 it is true that with respect to satoko 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.629
 miyahara the Japanese has more 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.969
 score on the t-shirt components 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.229
 that is top or the technique can be 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.159
 more or less point up point down 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:11.649
 but the components so there's a 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.319
 clear difference in favor of seniority 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:17.499
 the expression that your shirt has 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.179
 ease in the track the security 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.439
 seething is seen in the face in the 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.319
 first part of the program how it has gone 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:26.829
 so so scared and the moment in the 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.989
 that things have started to go 

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:32.139
 run them and them it has changed 

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:35.529
 the expression needed to appear to the 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.509
 first position 115 with 99 this 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.419
 program is not going to make you overcome your 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.189
 best mark of 141 points that earned them 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.229
 in the european championship where to go out 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.669
 everything round but I think it's going to be 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.280
 enough javier to go to the 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.230
 first position 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.080
 and then they remove it from there because she 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.100
 yes they have to do both very well 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.560
 japanese 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.520
 there are radio nova touched that is now 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.520
 in first and second respectively 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.460
 and waiting for what the two do 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.460
 remaining Japanese 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.630
 66 elements presentation almost 66 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:18.340
 first square 210 with 36 to accept and 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.670
 it goes that in the absence of competing 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.770
 two Japanese was just placed in 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.570
 first place and the medal is secured 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.740
 bronze but a lot a lot are going to have to 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.120
 fight the two Japanese 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.120
 to unseat
