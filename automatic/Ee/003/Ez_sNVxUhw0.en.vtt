00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.760
 the television rather filled a bit with 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.460
 michoacÃ¡n let's prepare this ring where 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.460
 I started to eat the tomatoes 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 chilitos 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.550
 and onion and I go forward a little step 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.830
 do not worry, I'll take a little step forward 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.830
 because it really happens to us that gaming 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 I do me this step was saying 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.150
 and I went to the flea market with Prestes and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 nano enchiladas is stretched normal and what 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 The only thing I did was to go through the poster 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 not the one that is very thin for me 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.860
 this needs like nothing more than a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
 pasadita put by him with mother to the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.180
 story says exactly and then the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520
 leche bramos is ready for you I'm going to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.610
 start 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.060
 add I turn on the espresso that has 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.060
 one whole 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.260
 I proceed then and the garlic also but 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:06.110
 I put him little because I do not like him very much 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.939
 and I tell you I tell you I already know how vampire 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.850
 I'm afraid of garlic my girl but there's no 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.850
 football and wait for me the magic 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.740
 everything will go together in all there is so 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 poor to the truth 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.060
 like the one that has been chanting this way all 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.410
 now they take monkeys and viruses and me 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.300
 I think it's one of the most 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.120
 I like it with flour tortilla or 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.979
 food as per warrior but now that 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.380
 there are no seekers are you as well as fast 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.180
 practical and simple 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.910
 I found this one seems to me a delight and 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.979
 Exactly rich and credit has everything 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.479
 exactly nothing else two so that it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.479
 set very well this egg avoided 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.470
 and here I am with my sauce already ready and 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:10.610
 I have a comal for not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.610
 the tortillas do not tell me why not 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.620
 no no no no 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:32.099
 the high sauce 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.510
 very well 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.900
 I liked it 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.569
 if they were fixed we do not season because 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.269
 the killer is very salty and already until 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.950
 let's be here let's see how much of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.849
 salt is what we need now if color 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.849
 of origin to the sauce I do not know why 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.240
 the sauce 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.900
 piston 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.900
 okay 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:12.240
 is to go watching look very good as when 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.850
 the sauce with the egg combination 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.770
 he has his joke ma'am he 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.990

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.730
