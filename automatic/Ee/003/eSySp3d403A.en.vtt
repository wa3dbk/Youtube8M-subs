00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
so bobby pins are is really tight ones

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.780 
so bobby pins are is really tight ones
that<00:02:17.209> keep<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.569> hair<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.560> tack<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.100> fringe

that keep the hair in tack and fringe

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.370 
that keep the hair in tack and fringe
pins<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.270> what<00:02:20.420> I'm<00:02:20.510> showing<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:21.110> and

pins is what I'm showing you now and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.630 
pins is what I'm showing you now and
they're<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.890> really<00:02:22.100> sort<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> loose

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640

and a lot of updos like they use fringe

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.680 
and a lot of updos like they use fringe
pins<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.459> it's<00:02:31.610> not<00:02:31.730> very<00:02:31.880> tight

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pins like this so it's not very tight

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.190 
pins like this so it's not very tight
and<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:36.000> start<00:02:36.270> wrapping<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> hair<00:02:36.960> around

and just start wrapping the hair around
and<00:02:37.890> using<00:02:38.640> those<00:02:38.760> pins<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.540> hold<00:02:39.720> that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and using those pins to just hold that

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.770 
and using those pins to just hold that
in<00:02:40.080> place<00:02:40.730> depending<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.850> how<00:02:42.330> long<00:02:42.570> your

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
whether that's a lot wrapped underneath

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060 
whether that's a lot wrapped underneath
or<00:02:51.090> not<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.600> much<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.770> quite

so just finishing up any excess hair
that's<00:03:13.170> left<00:03:13.440> over<00:03:13.820> sticking<00:03:14.820> pins<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.780> there

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
that's left over sticking pins in there

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.810 
that's left over sticking pins in there
just<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.410> make<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.680> look<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.950> lot<00:03:16.980> more<00:03:17.130> even

just to make that look a lot more even

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.150 
just to make that look a lot more even
and<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.720> well<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.200> flatten<00:03:19.710> down<00:03:19.920> any

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and as well you can flatten down any

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.190 
and as well you can flatten down any
flyaways<00:03:20.490> with<00:03:20.880> hairspray<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.630> didn't<00:03:21.900> use<00:03:22.020> any

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
like that the fingers leave so there are

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.430 
like that the fingers leave so there are
a<00:03:50.580> lot<00:03:50.760> more<00:03:50.790> thicker<00:03:51.630> than<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.230> brush

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
a lot more thicker than what the brush

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.949 
a lot more thicker than what the brush
appearance<00:03:53.070> sort<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.370> has<00:03:53.550> so<00:03:53.910> there's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> lot

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
appearance sort of has so there's a lot

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.990 
appearance sort of has so there's a lot
more<00:03:55.020> casual<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.680> um<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.640> make<00:03:56.850> this

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
more casual and um you can make this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.560 
more casual and um you can make this
quite<00:03:57.300> messy<00:03:57.720> or<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.200> bit<00:03:58.560> neater<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.980> well<00:04:02.570> to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
quite messy or a bit neater as well to

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.080 
quite messy or a bit neater as well to
get<00:04:03.720> more<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.530> bit<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.190> volume<00:04:05.850> through

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
get more of a a bit of a volume through

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.729 
get more of a a bit of a volume through
it<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.270> can<00:04:06.300> tease<00:04:06.690> first<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.290> all<00:04:07.470> but<00:04:07.650> I

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
it you can tease first of all but I

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.860 
it you can tease first of all but I
didn't<00:04:08.070> do<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:09.000> felt<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.810> had

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
didn't do that because I felt that I had

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.710 
didn't do that because I felt that I had
enough<00:04:10.200> volume<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.920> there<00:04:11.130> anyway<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:11.760> use<00:04:12.510> like

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
enough volume in there anyway I use like

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.830 
enough volume in there anyway I use like
a<00:04:12.780> little<00:04:13.140> dust<00:04:13.410> at<00:04:14.120> thing<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.330> I'll<00:04:15.510> sort<00:04:15.720> of

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
going you can fix it at the end with

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.210 
going you can fix it at the end with
hips<00:05:40.700> of<00:05:40.880> pins<00:05:41.120> or<00:05:41.450> if<00:05:42.200> you're<00:05:42.440> just<00:05:42.470> lucky<00:05:42.830> and
