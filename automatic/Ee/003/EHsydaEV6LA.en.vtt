this<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.380> seized<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.830> -<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.220> mean<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this was all seized up - I mean the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
this was all seized up - I mean the
thing<00:01:27.090> works<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.420> brand-new<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.020> fill<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
thing works like brand-new now fill the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
thing works like brand-new now fill the
full<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.250> deep<00:01:29.400> creep<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.150> kind<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
full of deep creep and I'm just kind of

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.030 
full of deep creep and I'm just kind of
letting<00:01:30.540> deep<00:01:30.840> creep<00:01:31.079> run<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
letting deep creep run down and I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
letting deep creep run down and I
believe<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.520> running<00:01:32.850> into<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> forward

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
believe it's running into the forward

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
believe it's running into the forward
cylinder<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> left-hand<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
cylinder on the left-hand side of the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.200 
cylinder on the left-hand side of the
engine<00:01:35.840> okay<00:01:37.310> which<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> believe<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.939> probably

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
engine okay which I believe is probably

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.910 
engine okay which I believe is probably
the<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.810> seized<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.470> took<00:01:40.619> my<00:01:40.770> little

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the one that seized up I took my little

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.310 
the one that seized up I took my little

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
camera my little scope camera and stuck
it<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.009> cylinder<00:01:44.430> walls<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it in the cylinder walls are in the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.359 
it in the cylinder walls are in the
spark<00:01:45.840> plug<00:01:46.049> holes<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.979> look<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
spark plug holes and to look at the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
spark plug holes and to look at the
cylinders<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.840> course<00:01:49.079> they're<00:01:49.259> all

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
cylinders and of course they're all

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.060 
cylinders and of course they're all
rustier<00:01:50.310> than<00:01:50.430> rusty<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.530> filled<00:01:52.920> those

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
rustier than rusty so I filled those

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.679 
rustier than rusty so I filled those
full<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> deep<00:01:53.610> creep<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> did<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
took this little tube here stuck this
tube<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> spark<00:01:58.680> plug<00:01:58.890> hole<00:01:59.149> then<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
tube in the spark plug hole then the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.539 
tube in the spark plug hole then the
other<00:02:00.420> end<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:01.530> over<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> nozzle<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
other end right over that nozzle and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.090 
other end right over that nozzle and
filled<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.140> course<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> stuff<00:02:04.799> started

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
filled it of course this stuff started

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300 
filled it of course this stuff started
to<00:02:05.159> ooze<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.719> blue<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.740> mouth<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to ooze out blue in it with my mouth and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.589 
to ooze out blue in it with my mouth and
blew<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.670> down<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> cylinder<00:02:09.509> it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
blew it right down into the cylinder it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
blew it right down into the cylinder it
kept<00:02:09.750> doing<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.410> six<00:02:10.800> seven<00:02:11.099> times

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
kept doing that about six seven times

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
kept doing that about six seven times
per<00:02:11.520> cylinder<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.720> there<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.110> some<00:02:13.319> deep

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
per cylinder so there is some deep

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
per cylinder so there is some deep
floating<00:02:14.099> around<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.519> there<00:02:14.670> at<00:02:14.969> least<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.299> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
floating around in there at least on the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.580 
floating around in there at least on the
bottom<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.959> cylinders<00:02:16.349> because<00:02:16.469> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
bottom of the cylinders because the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.750 
bottom of the cylinders because the
cylinders<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.189> car<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.579> run

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
cylinders in this car do run

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
cylinders in this car do run
horizontally<00:02:18.409> okay<00:02:19.409> for<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> guys<00:02:19.769> that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.709 
horizontally okay for you guys that
don't<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.280> they're<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:20.849> vertical<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.569> and

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
don't know they're not vertical up and

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:27.110 
don't know they're not vertical up and
down<00:02:21.870> Pistons<00:02:22.409> like<00:02:22.650> most<00:02:22.859> vehicles<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:26.120> what

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
like a lot of these latches things like

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.860 
like a lot of these latches things like
this<00:03:41.900> are<00:03:42.080> out<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> Volkswagen<00:03:42.680> Rabbit

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
this are out of like a Volkswagen Rabbit

this are out of like a Volkswagen Rabbit
all<00:03:44.870> right<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.260> got<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.530> do<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> little

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
all right so I got to do a little

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.140 
all right so I got to do a little
further<00:03:46.070> investigating<00:03:46.850> because<00:03:47.030> this

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
further investigating because this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.790 
further investigating because this
latches<00:03:47.540> throws<00:03:47.780> up<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.200> think<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.470> other<00:03:48.590> ones

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
latches throws up I think the other ones

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.450 
latches throws up I think the other ones
froze<00:03:49.070> up<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:51.050> windshield<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:52.070> believe<00:03:52.340> he

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
froze up the windshield I believe he
