00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.130
 I go to Uruguay your guts 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.469
 Carlos Marcovich also fit you to 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.440
 water having been the first winner with 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.700
 the cocheria respectively 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:25.210
 the truth was that it was a pleasure to have 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:32.770
 could a car make a coupe 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:36.040
 chevrolet in that 1972 and start climbing 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.010
 having the honor let's say we have 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.670
 won the return of chacabuco with this 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 automobile that took shape in the circuit 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.309
 of parchment is the official team 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.649
 chevrolet de carlos no no no the team 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.109
 he was always particular children yo 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.260
 I never really ran for the commission 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.850
 of the dealer but represented 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.840
 to the Commission of the concessionaire and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.330
 Of course they collaborated 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.350
 with my workshop but I was always a 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.920
 Private pilot with my workshop 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.830
 I started there 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.450
 making elche where amodu the woman 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 started running with me on my computer that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.320
 I was previously doing the car 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.180
 martÃ­nez good also a coupe 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.670
 chevrolet e el borravino and there in that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.159
 moment you see is happening modulates 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.310
 justly 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.909
 and a coupe that had other pains that 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.569
 mine was a red car that all the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.969
 world recognized and the first car there 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.600
 is the couvy chevy mine the propaganda of 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.759
 pests that of pla live so this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.030
 incredibly that the bullet shows her 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.270
 that the car of Carlos III and the car of 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.599
 roberto mouras that was the same but that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.289
 it had a medium orange color with a 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:09.700
 little orange more just brick with 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.890
 a strip along the car already 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.160
 post it returned to paint red 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.329
 same as mine and at some point 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.040
 he also wore vin vin 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.170
 circumstantially there is one I have a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.780
 picture and is in the magazine in a race 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.950
 of the racetrack raining that are the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.629
 two cars at par and they are identified 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.359
 because Robert's car said 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.269
 chevrolet on the windshield and the car 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.230
 Savarino said where they were exactly 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.180
 same 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 in my confusion over the teams 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.700
 official because we have seen the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.360
 official conassif forums and stands and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.430
 no doubt at that time the commission 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.310
 of dealerships was not running 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.360
 that is, the commission ran to the beginning 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.360
 in the in the year 71 with chevy chefs 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.290
 four doors and even garcia come 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.610
 wins in jumps and also in parchment and 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:14.620
 then it is dismembered in some way 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.769
 in the commission and then as I was 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.480
 running already with the chevy coupe that the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.219
 commission offered to help me and that I 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 I put the logo of the commission 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.810
 dealer but people interpreted 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.569
 that I was the official representative 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.840
 somehow it was but the team 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.840
 it was mine 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:47.230
 and there you see a sequence 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.069
 interesting that all and now the laugh 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.069
 this race 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.470
 the truth that good so many competitions 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.230
 and we're in a start there I see it 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.420
 move to the Suarez brothers 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.450
 the truth is that it was a time there what 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.950
 I also see one of the jumps I do not know if 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.849
 it was recalde a very nice time 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.129
 but I believe that the times of the 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.739
 runners have always been pretty the 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.859
 era who ran I think that 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.950
 now maybe inside enough 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:28.030
 time the son of john and benedictis or 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.030
 suddenly the son of Castilian inside 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.729
 of 30 or 40 years old they will say that this time is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:46.389
 a very nice time but we 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:48.970
 We will be with unfortunately Carlos 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.210

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.729
 our studies and the satisfaction of 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.800
 that you have remembered with such luxury of 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.530
 details of all the events of 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.180
