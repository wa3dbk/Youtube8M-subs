 stony 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.640

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.730
 about jumping on them here you need not 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.170
 beach slippers and mountain climbing sneakers 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.640

 people did not go there somewhere embankment and 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.449
 It seems there, too, everything is blocked by 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.110
 raspberries 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.879
 there is also everything is blocked so much 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.540
 go through to understand that again access 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:13.340
 can close apa 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.610
 that is, there is a chance to jump on which path 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 stone and such an extreme journey 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.810
 let's go further then 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.020
 jump on this pebble 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.299
 so get to the water 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.299
 interesting way you fill your 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.680
 good sneaker middle sole not 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.680
 glide 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.390
 let's take a place of water right now 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.700
 almost the path dance dance the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 last dance 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.899
 wait a little horror 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.280
 costly 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.160
 closer to the water so 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.369
 like a dead end well, not exactly some of these 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.369
 stairs 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.740

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 here here 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.280
 stones are laid well to walk on them 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.990
