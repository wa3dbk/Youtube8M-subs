00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.440
A soldier was going
Across a field, along a steep riverside,
By peasant's houses

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.720
Dressed in a gray greatcoat of private,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.000
A soldier was going

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.420
The soldier went, surmounting all obstacles

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.180
The soldier went, losing his friends

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.780
And it was often
When he had gone without a halt

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.640
But the soldier was moving forward

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.220
He was going in stormy nights

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.460
He was going in the rain and hail

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.120
Together with his combat friends
He was singing a song

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.100
The soldier was singing, swallowing tears

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
He was singing about Russian birches

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.780
About his beloved girl's hazel eyes

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.280
About the paternal home

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.560
The soldier singed on the way

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:05.420
It looked like his sub-machine gun
Adhered to his shoulder

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.040
The soldier fought and hit,
Damned enemies everywhere

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.820
The soldier fought and hit them nearby Smolensk

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.320
The soldier fought and hit them nearby the settlement N.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.280
The soldier fought and hit enemies,
Without counting the amount of [his] bullets

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.460
The soldier fought and hit enemies without rest

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.720
A soldier was going
Across a field, along a steep riverside,
By peasant's houses

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.620
Dressed in a gray greatcoat of private

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.360
A soldier was going

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.440
The soldier was going because he was a servant of Motherland

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.900
The soldier was going for the sake of life

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.960
He went, saving the World,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.300
Protecting the peace

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.820
The soldier was going forward!

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.300
Saving the World,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.740
Protecting the peace

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:45.740
The soldier was going forward!
