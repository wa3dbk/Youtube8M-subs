00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.420
 The earth surrounds a soft, thin layer of gas that keeps us warm and allows the weather to happen 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.370
 And make life essentially possible on earth. But our atmosphere is precious 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 Currently leaks every second to outer space. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.710
 Fortunately it leaks slowly, since it requires any body - whether it is a molecule of gas, a rock or a cat - 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.289
 To penetrate the field of gravity of the earth and to escape them, to be launched from 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 The earth is 33 times faster than the sound. 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 This requires 2,000 pounds of explosive TNT to propel someone so quickly, and less energy 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.570
 For lighter objects. For example, one hundred kilograms of TNT energy to drive a cat. And to prevent a massive asteroid from impacting the Earth 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.790
 The atmosphere releases large amounts of air into space. The only gases 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.020
 Which regularly leak out now are hydrogen and helium, the lighter elements in the universe. 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 There are some ways that hydrogen and helium molecules can end up in space without return. 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.440
 Some particles near the upper part of the atmosphere easily get enough energy to escape out of the heat of the sun. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.460
 Some are high-charged charged particles that are usually blocked 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.620
 The magnetic field of the Earth to escape. Sometimes, however, these fast electrons lack atoms 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 Collide with a neutral molecule and with sufficient force to collide, the electron abandons one of its atoms and takes one of the particles of the neutral molecule. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.970
 It becomes a molecule in itself. The accelerated particles are released from the Earth's magnetic field, 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.080
 If it happens to put the collision in the path of stars, it will remain there. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.650
 Finally, some of the Earth's magnetic field lines are weak, the solar wind drives them away from Earth, 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.460
 Solar wind means the high flow of charged particles (plasma) emitted from the sun. 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 The charged particles of magnetic fields can simply escape through their weak limbs like a full-energy buzzer. 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.070
 But if our planet does not have any magnetic field, things will be much worse. For example, Mars, 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.940
 It has no protective magnetic field. What does the atmosphere have? 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.970
 But the solar wind blows it up and keeps breaking it. Even with the protective bubble, the Earth loses 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.229
 Hydrogen is enough to fill a balloon with a meter wide every second. Do not worry 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.860
 It will take a few billion years before we lose all hydrogen in this way. But maybe someday 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.909
 In the distant future, someone will look at the earth and wonder as we are now wondering about Mars. 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.119
