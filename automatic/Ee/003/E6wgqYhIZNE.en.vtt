and red wire running into the gray
connector<00:01:03.920> next<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.040> need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> find<00:01:05.460> which

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
connector next we'll need to find which

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
connector next we'll need to find which
side<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> hot<00:01:06.540> when<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> vehicle<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.920> put<00:01:08.130> into

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.330 
side is hot when the vehicle is put into
reverse<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.300> with<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> piece<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.050> wire<00:01:10.770> we'll<00:01:11.220> go

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
reverse so with a piece of wire we'll go

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
reverse so with a piece of wire we'll go
ahead<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> back<00:01:11.850> probe<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> connector<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
ahead and back probe the connector and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
ahead and back probe the connector and
use<00:01:13.259> our<00:01:13.500> test<00:01:13.799> light<00:01:14.009> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> vehicle<00:01:15.330> in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
use our test light with the vehicle in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 
use our test light with the vehicle in
Reverse<00:01:15.799> checking<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> connection<00:01:17.310> point<00:01:17.520> as
