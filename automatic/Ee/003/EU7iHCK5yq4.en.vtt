00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
start with a 78 if the bait this is

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.930

will probably go with a pointer 78 which
really<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.740> most<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:57.400> hands<00:02:57.760> down

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
really is the most this one hands down

absolute favorite color in most lakes we

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.940 
absolute favorite color in most lakes we
go<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.000> got<00:03:38.660> clear<00:03:38.930> waters<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.319> ghost<00:03:39.590> minute

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
go to got clear waters a ghost minute

go to got clear waters a ghost minute
that's<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.430> number<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:40.790> choice<00:03:41.290> I'll<00:03:42.290> start

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
that's my number one choice I'll start

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.650 
that's my number one choice I'll start
from<00:03:42.860> there<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.940> start<00:03:44.239> getting<00:03:44.510> some

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
from there and we start getting some

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.039 
from there and we start getting some
overcast<00:03:45.349> or<00:03:46.060> cloudy<00:03:47.060> conditions<00:03:47.360> then<00:03:47.959> I'll

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
overcast or cloudy conditions then I'll

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.430 
overcast or cloudy conditions then I'll
probably<00:03:48.200> go<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.709> charts<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.400> shad<00:03:49.640> then

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
probably go to the charts and shad then

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.660 
probably go to the charts and shad then
you<00:03:51.440> know<00:03:51.560> there's<00:03:51.739> another<00:03:52.069> great<00:03:52.370> clear

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
you know there's another great clear

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.449 
you know there's another great clear
water<00:03:52.970> color<00:03:53.239> right<00:03:53.510> there<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.920> then

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
water color right there so and then

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.210 
water color right there so and then
probably<00:03:55.940> move<00:03:56.329> on<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.140> nishiki<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.040> is

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
probably move on to the nishiki this is

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.000 
probably move on to the nishiki this is
just<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.489> great<00:03:58.700> Clearwater<00:03:59.629> bait<00:04:00.010> overcast

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
just a great Clearwater bait overcast

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
other the water and light changes then

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.430 
other the water and light changes then
that<00:04:06.769> may<00:04:06.920> determine<00:04:07.340> if<00:04:07.579> I<00:04:07.700> change<00:04:08.030> from<00:04:08.569> with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
that may determine if I change from with

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.559 
that may determine if I change from with

of oil finish they have the lure of
black<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.680> then<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:15.829> start<00:04:16.070> getting<00:04:16.160> into

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
black and then we start getting into

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.180

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
get a blue chartreuse you can still go
