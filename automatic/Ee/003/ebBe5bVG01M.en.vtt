and I will eventually sell but as I said

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.659 
and I will eventually sell but as I said
I'm<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.949> do<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.069> in<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> listing

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
I'm not going to do that in the listing

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.039 
I'm not going to do that in the listing
my<00:04:05.729> choice<00:04:05.970> boiling<00:04:06.299> would<00:04:06.389> put<00:04:06.510> on<00:04:06.540> transfer

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
my choice boiling would put on transfer

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.149 
my choice boiling would put on transfer
this<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.319> believe<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.769> would<00:04:07.829> go<00:04:07.949> up<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
this and I believe it would go up to

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.210 
this and I believe it would go up to
about<00:04:08.370> 800<00:04:08.879> thousand<00:04:09.479> coins<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.620> male

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
about 800 thousand coins to a male

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.199 
about 800 thousand coins to a male
because<00:04:11.340> obviously<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.760> coming<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.090> end

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
because obviously is coming to the end

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.580 
because obviously is coming to the end
of<00:04:12.299> fifa<00:04:12.569> coins<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.139> get<00:04:13.229> a<00:04:13.260> cheaper

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
of fifa coins going to get a cheaper

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.020 
of fifa coins going to get a cheaper

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
players are going to rise that's the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.699 
players are going to rise that's the
reason<00:04:15.150> why<00:04:15.419> i<00:04:15.449> put<00:04:16.169> them<00:04:16.289> on<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.440> transfer

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
reason why i put them on the transfer

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.140 
reason why i put them on the transfer
list<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.220> method<00:04:17.579> does<00:04:17.609> work<00:04:17.909> just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
list so this method does work just

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.750 
list so this method does work just
