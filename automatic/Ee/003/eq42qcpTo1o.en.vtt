00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the energy to do all that much and when

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.710 
the energy to do all that much and when
you<00:00:21.539> do<00:00:21.900> move<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.380> move<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:23.070> slowly<00:00:23.789> well

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like for a sloth sloths are the slowest

slowly they don't need to go to the
bathroom<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> often<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.399> fact<00:01:50.790> one

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
bathroom as often as we do in fact one

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
bathroom as often as we do in fact one
of<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> few<00:01:51.420> times<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.840> three-toed<00:01:52.500> sloths

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of the few times that three-toed sloths

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.440 
of the few times that three-toed sloths
come<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> trees<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.329> their

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
come down from the trees it's for their

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319 
come down from the trees it's for their
weekly<00:01:54.659> potty<00:01:55.140> break<00:01:55.439> once<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> week<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
weekly potty break once a week that's it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
weekly potty break once a week that's it
another<00:01:57.750> weird<00:01:58.049> way<00:01:58.229> sloths<00:01:58.590> conserve<00:01:59.070> energy

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
another weird way sloths conserve energy

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
another weird way sloths conserve energy
is<00:01:59.670> by<00:01:59.969> having<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.420> naturally<00:02:00.960> low<00:02:01.200> body

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is by having a naturally low body

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.530 
is by having a naturally low body
temperature<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.250> our<00:02:02.729> body<00:02:03.060> temperature

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
temperature if our body temperature

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
temperature if our body temperature
changes<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.079> than<00:02:04.140> three<00:02:04.469> degrees<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
changes more than three degrees it

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.469 
changes more than three degrees it
probably<00:02:05.520> means<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> we're<00:02:05.969> sick<00:02:06.180> but

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
probably means that we're sick but

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
probably means that we're sick but
that's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> two-toed<00:02:07.979> sloths<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that's not so for the two-toed sloths it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.369 
that's not so for the two-toed sloths it
has<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> lowest<00:02:09.330> body<00:02:09.720> temperature<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> any

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
has the lowest body temperature of any

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.800 
has the lowest body temperature of any
mammal<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> world<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.270> dip<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.540> low<00:02:12.569> as

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
mammal in the world it can dip as low as

mammal in the world it can dip as low as
thirty<00:02:13.080> degrees

thirty degrees
most<00:02:14.640> mammals<00:02:14.940> including<00:02:15.690> us<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.200> body

higher<00:02:18.690> after<00:02:19.260> all<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.980> takes<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.250> lot<00:02:20.460> of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
higher after all it takes a lot of

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.340 
higher after all it takes a lot of
energy<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> keep<00:02:21.150> your<00:02:21.300> body<00:02:21.480> warm<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.200> when

sloths aren't active which is most the

sloths aren't active which is most the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
way that sloths save energy is my

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
way that sloths save energy is my
personal<00:02:32.550> favorite<00:02:33.000> three-toed<00:02:33.750> sloths<00:02:34.080> are

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
personal favorite three-toed sloths are

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
personal favorite three-toed sloths are
the<00:02:34.470> only<00:02:35.070> mammal<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.520> can<00:02:35.820> rotate<00:02:36.120> their

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the only mammal that can rotate their

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.030 
the only mammal that can rotate their
heads<00:02:36.660> almost<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.500> way<00:02:37.620> around<00:02:37.920> their

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
heads almost all the way around their

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.490 
heads almost all the way around their
bodies<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.670> owls<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.020> because<00:02:40.350> they

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
bodies like owls do this is because they

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.200 
bodies like owls do this is because they
have<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:40.860> vertebrae<00:02:41.340> or<00:02:41.520> bones<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.090> their

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
have more vertebrae or bones in their

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.850 
have more vertebrae or bones in their
neck<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.570> other<00:02:42.690> mammals<00:02:43.110> do<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.620> cool

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
neck than other mammals do this cool

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.440 
neck than other mammals do this cool
trick<00:02:44.100> helps<00:02:44.370> them<00:02:44.520> look<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.880> food<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.330> keep

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
trick helps them look for food and keep

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.120 
trick helps them look for food and keep
an<00:02:45.570> eye<00:02:45.660> out<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.840> predators<00:02:46.320> without<00:02:46.710> having

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
an eye out for predators without having

an eye out for predators without having
to<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.610> anywhere<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.570> anything<00:02:48.900> they<00:02:49.470> can

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
to go anywhere or do anything they can

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.960 
to go anywhere or do anything they can
just<00:02:49.770> hang<00:02:49.980> out<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.370> twist<00:02:50.580> their<00:02:50.820> head

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
just hang out and twist their head

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.490 
just hang out and twist their head
around<00:02:51.150> observing<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.780> world<00:02:51.930> around<00:02:52.140> them

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
around observing the world around them

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.520 
around observing the world around them
so<00:02:52.920> sure<00:02:53.250> sloths<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:54.030> slow<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:54.990> not<00:02:55.170> because

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so sure sloths are slow but not because

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.090 
so sure sloths are slow but not because
they're<00:02:55.710> lazy

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
they're lazy

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.040 
they're lazy
they've<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.700> adapted<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> nice<00:02:57.630> mellow

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
they've just adapted to a nice mellow

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.530 
they've just adapted to a nice mellow
low-energy<00:02:58.860> lifestyle<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.030> works<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.330> well

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
low-energy lifestyle that works out well

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180 
low-energy lifestyle that works out well
for<00:03:00.750> them<00:03:00.870> they're<00:03:01.260> basically<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.010> ultimate

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
