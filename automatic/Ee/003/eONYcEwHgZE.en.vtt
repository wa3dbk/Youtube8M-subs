00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:23.420
 there are probably 4 batteries here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:30.269
 so installed model p ah 350 911 brs 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 here we have well as always in the code 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:40.340
 encrypted no more information on 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.270

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430
 pick up 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.090
 and then pick up what's under there 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.090
 picked one 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.700
 Nina is good 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.140
 in short 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.040
 ordinary user will not understand need 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.010
 and not sickly 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:58.890
 that is, don't even try to buy those 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:04:01.210
 more than he 2 thousand quickly open yes he 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.270

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:09.580
 Kapets connected on the sides of the four below 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.680
 just two on top from here on top is better 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:21.489
 double-sided turns open 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:23.590
 so here we see sanyo 4 things father so 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:30.610
 picked and it turns out the balance is not 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:35.470
 injured and even resist so well here at 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:44.740
 we can kill even though something 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:50.250
 small was with in the course stick 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.250
 Yes, the Kapets did not regret the phone 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.580
 have them 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:05.569
 we have 4 consecutive batteries where 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:09.720
 see what we have here how are you 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:12.960
 so nil collection is already replenished so 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:19.789
 the corpse is not visible like they boil so 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.789
 1 volt on the battery so 2 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:42.930
 what is the herringbone 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:44.230
 358 403 5356 but bumazhechki so 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.440
 here he is 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.440
 that 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:56.759

 that is, here it is this cross 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:21.000
 but they are workers it is good that is 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:28.659
 batteries can be easily 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:30.699
 regenerate so there is a connector so 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:35.139
 here we have extremely minus plus 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:38.680
 here it is stated there is even a chance that here 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:44.969
 direct voltage goes and control goes 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.969
 major laptops i.e. 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.740
 their 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.310

 controller squirrels 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.610
 yes here is spontaneous combustion itself 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.699
 disconnection 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:18.440
 So how do we have here on the temperature sensors 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:25.580
 go 2 so here is perdo here it is first 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:34.870
 stumbles here 2 Well on ponyatnenko 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:40.940

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:44.060
 220 is, that is, body 22 , that is, 2200 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.520
 understand this battery was declared two 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.760
 points 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:55.010
 can sanyo we have a collection already 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:58.160
 continue to continue in the next review 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:01.419
 Consider a new battery for it all
