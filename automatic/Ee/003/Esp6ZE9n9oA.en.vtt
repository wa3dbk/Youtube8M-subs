00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
prefer the width of the current seat but

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.020 
prefer the width of the current seat but
I<00:00:34.920> understand<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.700> trade-offs

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

but<00:00:48.300> also<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:49.020> mean<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.410> nice<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.980> more

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
inch wide seats acceptable yeah I mean I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
inch wide seats acceptable yeah I mean I
think<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.920> totally<00:01:07.920> okay<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
think it's totally okay to get a little

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
think it's totally okay to get a little
bit<00:01:08.939> closer<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> people<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.680> especially<00:01:11.280> if

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bit closer to people and especially if

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.070 
bit closer to people and especially if
it<00:01:11.729> means<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.180> more<00:01:12.240> space<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it means there's more space to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.700 
it means there's more space to
accommodate<00:01:14.119> people<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.630> standing<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> more

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
accommodate people for standing and more

accommodate people for standing and more
bicycles<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> understand<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.900> know

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
bicycles and I understand that you know

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.140

people<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.530> taking<00:01:19.680> bart<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:21.090> to

people are taking bart more to get to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
people are taking bart more to get to
airport<00:01:21.390> something<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.140> room<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.500> luggage

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
airport something so room for luggage

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.380 
airport something so room for luggage
and<00:01:23.009> I'd<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> actually

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and I'd like to think that actually

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.640 
and I'd like to think that actually
people<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.080> live<00:01:25.470> their

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
people are going to just live their

people are going to just live their
daily<00:01:25.799> lives<00:01:26.100> using<00:01:26.490> Bart<00:01:26.820> more<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.360> maybe<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
daily lives using Bart more so maybe I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.450 
daily lives using Bart more so maybe I
need<00:01:27.869> room<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> groceries<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
