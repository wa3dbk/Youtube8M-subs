00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
better than wide rule I just like the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.770 
better than wide rule I just like the
way<00:02:25.460> it<00:02:25.670> looks<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.210> easier<00:02:26.510> for<00:02:26.660> me<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
way it looks and it's easier for me to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.930 
way it looks and it's easier for me to
write<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.680> yeah<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:28.190> looks<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:28.700> there's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
write so yeah it just looks like there's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
write so yeah it just looks like there's
there's<00:02:29.270> these<00:02:29.360> little<00:02:29.570> dividers<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.320> between

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
there's these little dividers in between

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.100 
there's these little dividers in between
them<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.250> there's<00:02:31.520> place<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.360> put<00:02:32.570> notes<00:02:32.840> for

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
them so there's place to put notes for

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.380 
them so there's place to put notes for
each<00:02:33.170> class<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.890> pretty<00:02:34.160> much<00:02:34.250> take<00:02:34.580> notes<00:02:35.030> for

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
each class I pretty much take notes for

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.290 
each class I pretty much take notes for
classes<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:35.930> um<00:02:36.590> don't<00:02:37.370> move<00:02:37.640> too<00:02:38.000> fast

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
classes that um don't move too fast

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.060 
classes that um don't move too fast
because<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.810> do<00:02:39.020> prefer<00:02:39.500> writing<00:02:39.680> things<00:02:40.010> down

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
because I do prefer writing things down

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.550 
because I do prefer writing things down
because<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.060> way<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.210> remember<00:02:41.720> them<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.110> lot

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
because that way I remember them a lot

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.260 
because that way I remember them a lot
better<00:02:42.800> than<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.400> were<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.640> type<00:02:43.850> them<00:02:44.090> all

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
better than if I were to type them all

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.850 
better than if I were to type them all
so<00:02:44.540> you're<00:02:44.780> not<00:02:44.870> gonna<00:02:45.050> get<00:02:45.230> distracted<00:02:45.350> by
