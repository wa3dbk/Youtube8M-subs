00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi girls today a request to explain 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.490
 when you must use different 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.490
 volumes of hydrogen peroxide to dye 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.060
 let's start with the water assigned to 10 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.790
 volumes are usually used as per 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.150
 tooth that this means that it 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.890
 used to cover difficult wants by 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.350
 well to say it is also commonly used 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 to color hair on bases 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.420
 clear when I want to darken 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.629
 you use 10 volume water 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.089
 on a clear basis in this case if 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.760
 you're blonde and brunette want to put it 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.760
 uses two waters and nobody 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.570
 the murdered water of 20 volumes what 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.780
 we would use to cover gray no 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.180
 difficult some normal beds 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.030
 to color dark hair over 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.590
 any base would not mind a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 clear base as we have previously 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.860
 distinguish 10 in 20 would not be necessary and 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.500
 on is also used to dye 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.190
 color tones to 2 when you have used 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.380
 discoloration to cover the and also it 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.940
 uses bleach knowing the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.940
 duration you want to have 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.990
 and hydrogen peroxide 30 volumes , 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.380
 we can use to lighten dyes or 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.980
 To dye natural hair base as 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.600
 it would be the root 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 but so that always to clarify 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.270
 finally the oxygenated water of 40 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.820
 volumes that is only used for 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.899
 increase the power of lightening the hair 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.310
 that would be the super lightening me this 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.350
 oxygenated water is the only one that I have not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.330
 tried but they say that in root 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.060
 damage to the scalp take care 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.220
 so I hope that it served you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.950
 help and if you have a doubt you put it to me 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.160
 down here and I will try to solve it a 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160
 Little kiss
