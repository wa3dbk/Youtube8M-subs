video<00:00:56.590> get<00:00:56.800> out<00:00:56.920> there<00:00:57.130> before<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:58.000> get<00:00:58.120> further

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
video get out there before I get further

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.119 
video get out there before I get further
into<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.720> video<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.020> will<00:00:59.410> say<00:00:59.710> this<00:00:59.890> only

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
into the video I will say this only

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.090 
into the video I will say this only
works<00:01:00.640> for<00:01:00.940> local<00:01:01.239> gameplay<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:02.290> this<00:01:02.680> is<00:01:02.860> not

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
works for local gameplay so this is not

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.610 
works for local gameplay so this is not
work<00:01:03.400> for<00:01:03.730> custom<00:01:04.150> games<00:01:04.449> or<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> public<00:01:05.410> match

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
work for custom games or a public match

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.830 
work for custom games or a public match
so<00:01:06.400> this<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.790> no<00:01:06.970> way<00:01:07.180> affects<00:01:07.690> the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so this is no way affects the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.780 
so this is no way affects the
leaderboards<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.070> once<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.400> start<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.759> game

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
leaderboards so once you start the game

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.030 
leaderboards so once you start the game
up<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.420> won't<00:01:10.600> open<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.960> first<00:01:11.259> right<00:01:11.740> door

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
up you won't open the first right door

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.310 
up you won't open the first right door
and<00:01:12.310> kill<00:01:12.850> all<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> aliens<00:01:13.509> once<00:01:14.170> you
