00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
dot modded shader packs are pretty cool

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
dot modded shader packs are pretty cool
but<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:15.269> gonna<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.690> honest<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.500> myself

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
but I'm gonna be honest I do have myself

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.800 
but I'm gonna be honest I do have myself
a<00:00:16.890> pretty<00:00:17.100> powerful<00:00:17.279> computer<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.480> since<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
a pretty powerful computer but since I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.420 
a pretty powerful computer but since I
have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> dual<00:00:19.320> screen<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.400> have

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
have a dual screen going on like I have

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.730 
have a dual screen going on like I have
two<00:00:20.699> monitors<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.869> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> splits

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
two monitors going on it kind of splits

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.820 
two monitors going on it kind of splits
my<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.820> RAM<00:00:24.510> usage<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:25.260> only<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.619> Ram

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
my my like RAM usage not only just Ram

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.620 
my my like RAM usage not only just Ram
but<00:00:26.010> my<00:00:26.130> graphics<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.090> splits<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> into

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
but my graphics it just splits it into

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.950 
but my graphics it just splits it into
and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.890> still<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.880> Minecraft<00:00:30.480> even<00:00:30.840> with

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and I still like in Minecraft even with

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
and I still like in Minecraft even with
shaders<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.590> guys<00:00:31.679> didn't<00:00:31.980> know<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
shaders if you guys didn't know all of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.060 
shaders if you guys didn't know all of
this<00:00:32.669> footage<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.270> fast<00:00:33.750> forward<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.649> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
this footage is fast forward I know it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
this footage is fast forward I know it's
a<00:00:35.190> two<00:00:35.399> minute<00:00:35.610> time-lapse<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> video

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
a two minute time-lapse so the video

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.660 
a two minute time-lapse so the video
clip<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> two<00:00:37.440> minutes<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> fast<00:00:38.280> forward

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
clip is two minutes but I fast forward

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
clip is two minutes but I fast forward
it<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> 30<00:00:39.180> seconds<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.170> only<00:00:40.320> reason<00:00:40.620> why<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
it to 30 seconds the only reason why I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.069 
it to 30 seconds the only reason why I
do<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.210> makes<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> camera

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
do that is because a it makes the camera

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
do that is because a it makes the camera
move<00:00:43.440> slower<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.070> plus<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.700> looks

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
move slower and plus it just looks

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.310 
move slower and plus it just looks
cooler<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.539> fast<00:00:45.690> forward<00:00:46.079> would<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
cooler when it's fast forward would I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
cooler when it's fast forward would I
recommend<00:00:46.649> any<00:00:46.950> sort<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> shader<00:00:47.489> pack<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.030> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
recommend any sort of shader pack in a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
recommend any sort of shader pack in a
mod<00:00:48.539> pack<00:00:48.890> probably<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.100> reason<00:00:50.610> why<00:00:50.730> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
mod pack probably not reason why is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
mod pack probably not reason why is
there's<00:00:51.149> only<00:00:51.300> hardly<00:00:52.199> any<00:00:52.350> shader<00:00:52.649> packs

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there's only hardly any shader packs

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
there's only hardly any shader packs
that<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.160> recommended<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.820> gameplay<00:00:54.420> it's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that are recommended for gameplay it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
that are recommended for gameplay it's
more<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> appeal<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
more of just the appeal of it so if

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.099 
more of just the appeal of it so if
you're<00:00:56.910> doing<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.239> time-lapse<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.960> you're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you're doing a time-lapse if you're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
you're doing a time-lapse if you're
doing<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> roleplay<00:00:58.949> series<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
doing a roleplay series or if you just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.209 
doing a roleplay series or if you just
trying<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.539> Minecraft<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.440> guess<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
trying to show off Minecraft I guess you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.590 
trying to show off Minecraft I guess you
could<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> shader<00:01:02.789> pack<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.420> when<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
could use a shader pack but when it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 
could use a shader pack but when it
comes<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> playing<00:01:04.290> Minecraft<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.100> don't

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
comes down to playing Minecraft I don't

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
comes down to playing Minecraft I don't
really<00:01:05.760> recommend<00:01:05.970> change

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

that's<00:01:15.060> why<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> am<00:01:15.659> uploading<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.350> shader<00:01:16.650> pack

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that's why I am uploading a shader pack

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.469 
that's why I am uploading a shader pack
review<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.759> something<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.270> could

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
review because this is something I could

just make really fast just to show you
guys<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.909> shader<00:01:21.180> pack<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:21.780> show<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
guys this shader pack can also show you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
guys this shader pack can also show you
guys<00:01:22.500> how<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> install<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.640> case<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.180> guys

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
guys how to install it in case you guys

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.850 
guys how to install it in case you guys
wanted<00:01:24.659> shaders<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.229> minecraft<00:01:25.650> game

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
wanted shaders in your minecraft game

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
wanted shaders in your minecraft game
now<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.400> running<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.820> shader<00:01:27.119> pack<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
now I'm running this shader pack and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
now I'm running this shader pack and
you're<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.350> notice<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you're gonna notice that I kind of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
you're gonna notice that I kind of

in my opinion are stellar so I would
give<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.150> around<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.140> know<00:02:37.260> I'd<00:02:37.680> give<00:02:37.860> it
