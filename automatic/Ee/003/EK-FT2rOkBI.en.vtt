00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.920
 Hello valerian with you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.539
 and you look and airborne before you in was 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 bbm fifth level sophie branch 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.880
 for short it is very very very 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.609
 good firefly maximum speed 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 cars 90 kilometers per hour which she 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.359
 is gaining 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.880
 effortlessly overclocking to 32 a little more than two 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.010
 seconds maneuverability is so good 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.610
 that sometimes you will have thoughts about 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 Is there a way to reduce its review 505 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 meters and stealth 04 allows us 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 do not pay attention to a small stock 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
 strength at seven hundred fifty nine 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.920
 units and the complete lack of armor as 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.430
 the enemy will need very well 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.199
 try to get on this car 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.579
 as weapons on bel can 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 set 20 millimeter 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.760
 automatic gun or cluster cassette 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.840
 like 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.949
 it all depends on your style of play 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 automatically 20 mm gun 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.500
 breaking 90 millimeters one-time damage 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.659
 34 in the ribbon 45 rounds it allows 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 cause fifteen hundred damage in 9 seconds 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.259
 and of course it's worth noting the magnificent 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 you gun declination -13 -15 down in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.009
 whichever way 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.009
 deployed gun and top gun 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.600
 rises 55 degrees and and stands 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.280
 use in case you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 more like an aggressive style of play 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 that is, you are actively moving throughout 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 map and highlight the enemy 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 go around it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 distract and at the same time apply good 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.799
 damage to board or stern 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 plus you can successfully attack 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.189
 single purpose which for some 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.189
 reasons is in splendid isolation 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.970
 tour 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
 to the network four missiles with a damage of 247 and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 breaking five hundred and thirty-five 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 millimeters recharge time throughout 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 installation is 24 seconds time 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.189
 between the launch of rockets 2 seconds tour worth 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 use in case you 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.149
 more like a passive light occupied 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.520
 some position from long range 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.560
 you highlight the enemy for your allies 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.730
 at the same time you can apply to the enemy 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.220
 damage benefit breaking through missiles letting 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.989
 punch goals without any problems but not 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 forget that when launching rockets 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.769
 your markedly increases and 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.959
 to light you up for the enemy won't make 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.430
 great labor so be careful 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.760
 and keep track of how far 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.379
 otvas enemy technology for myself I 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.830
 opted for automatic 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.510
 the guns 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 with her we will go to battle on 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.590
 map hot sand and see what 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 represents himself was on the battlefield 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.099
 a few words about the enemy team 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.349
 there are several cars on which costs 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.329
 pay special attention zinc file 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.030
 which shines through big without problems 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.859
 part of card 2 lav 300 they can well 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.459
 hand out come to life our team with big 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.190
 distances 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.590
 while remaining unnoticed a t-80 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.959
 and m 63 represents a serious problem 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 for the technique that will go so far 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.520
 therefore we do not waste time and quickly 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.260
 going to square and 020 to have 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.740
 opportunity to visit the first and zero 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.540
 line 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.030
 as well as all those who will rise in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.860
 center as you can see in was easily gaining 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.440
 speed over rough terrain and without 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.330
 problems it keeps only got to 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.610
 places and here already leopard and sheridan 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.270
 opening fire on the last and sending 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.190
 him in the hangar 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.320
 but at the same time I also fall into the light and 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.370
 Immediately go to the safe as high 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.910
 probability of getting 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.080
 and those who can stand on the f line 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.490
 illuminated taking up a position slightly 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.470
 away not to risk being 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.910
 illuminated again and now comes 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.910
 second sheridan 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.709
 and now Leopard 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.770
 stand on no sense need 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.540
 to move here on our hand plays 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.070
 good maneuverability as the case 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.260
 if a large number is found 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.260
 the enemy then no problem will leave 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.280
 take care I'll find three leopards right away 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.630
 being in their company is not very 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.340
 good idea as well as trying 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.650
 turn right in front of them 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.959
 most likely will not have time to give a couple of photos 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.690
 so we go on and away from 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.760
 the enemy will be a little later 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.350
 I take 1 lamp forts capture and starting 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.150
 unload the tape into it at the same time 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.010
 I carefully watch where it goes as 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.900
 have to go somewhere and stay in 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.130
 surrounded by five tanks nothing good 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.800
 finished sorting out whether the one in 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.660
 I'm leaving in the safe I was shot one wheel 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.520
 and now the machine is not gaining maximum 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.580
 speed but use repair kit 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.320
 yet makes no sense until the food in 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.220
 Places quieter in time to pick up more 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.220
 single sheridan 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.650
 standing on the backlight and at the same time waiting for now 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:27.540
 mend wheel repair is over I go 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:29.430
 on the second round gorgeous corners 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.040
 declension allows you to shoot from behind the hill 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.040
 showing the enemy only a small part of the machine 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.790
 you need to try to play from relief to 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.240
 in which case there was always the possibility 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.240
 to hide 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.840
 bmp is trying to drive closer to the allies 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.840
 but it's late to go to the hangar 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.530
 and this is up to the rank across the zero line to 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.639
 go to the enemy in the board while he is distracted 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.639
 on ally technique 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.000
 as you can see the car can inflict on any 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.590
 in the bumps so always 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.970
 follow who are you going and what 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:56.620
 gets under your wheels destroying 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.820
 sing fire and going for arta 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.040
 see the first come closer 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.170
 and killed using shelter as 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.210
 if she can do me damage by 2 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.010
 Art can finish me so need 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.010
 reduce the likelihood of this to a minimum 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.800
 and here is the last one driving past her 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.930
 giving you the opportunity to hit me and 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.380
 victory 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.600
 4700 damage 6 frags good result in 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.310
 I had a great bbm I think that should be 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.530
 for everyone it burns as it is capable 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.960
 give a lot of fans to their owner 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.160
 and on this i have all subscribe to 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.160
 channel to new meetings
