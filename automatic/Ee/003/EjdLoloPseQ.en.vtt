00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.549
 advise but in the opened server nick 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.890

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.550
 meet but in general, come in a reference 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.550
 description now there is a competition 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 all k guys today with you nickname locker 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.340
 and today i will show you how to create 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.470
 boots of earth magic yes yes you are not 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 misheard the boots of earth magic but for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 we will like this as always 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 command block 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180
 command link to which will be in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 description well and activate the command 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 block 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 many say my teams don't 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 work but valin not play on version 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.739
 152 run from version 18 they will all be 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.539
 work is almost built lined up 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:00.870
 you can destroy everything and for clarity, I 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.670
 I will come out of the game mod game from 0 for crafting 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.010
 our magic boots 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.070
 throw a block of earth and skull skeletons 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.700
 scrubber in 1 place yes yes our boots 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 ready 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 what can these boots do they can 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 generate blocks of land beneath you when 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 you look down well for me to class 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 that is, you fall hop look name 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 analyze the damage that you do 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.560
 though it doesn't always work sometimes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 you need to hold shift to make it work 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.550
 but still it's an eye on that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.940
 there is rising so endlessly 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.159
 interesting now let's get to the water here 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.280
 it also works if you go up 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.280
 radio height then checked reg reg 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.890
 see along with the water is understood then 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.890
 everything is fine 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.049
 but such is the water itself apparently not 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.620
 rises it's a shame well and so if 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.690
 the land is even under the sand, in fact 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.780
 should work let's put it here 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.670
 let's say that's see and just rises 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 then it is the land actually 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.560
 as if the command block can also 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.500
 make of our block red dust and 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.209
 so raise these things 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 the fruit well it would seem very cool but 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.430
 after all there is another ability to abruptly 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.879
 we look at the door in front of us is building a wall 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.739
 when she protects that's so cool 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.720
 teams will be higher with us using this 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.680
