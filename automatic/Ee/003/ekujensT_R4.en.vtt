you a hint so that's basically one move
away<00:01:43.520> there's<00:01:43.910> two<00:01:44.090> three<00:01:44.420> four<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:45.170> more<00:01:45.470> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
away there's two three four the more you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.469 
away there's two three four the more you
mix<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.979> up<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.250> harder<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.760> patterns<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
mix it up the harder the patterns on the

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.210 
mix it up the harder the patterns on the
cube<00:01:47.690> are<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> be<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.170> recognize<00:01:48.440> we're

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
cube are going to be to recognize we're

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.800 
cube are going to be to recognize we're
gonna<00:01:49.340> mix<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.729> up<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.970> about<00:01:50.150> 20<00:01:50.600> moves

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
gonna mix it up to about 20 moves

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.050 
gonna mix it up to about 20 moves
waiting<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.229> go<00:01:51.320> back<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.770> time<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.700> picture

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
waiting to go back in time so picture

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.219 
waiting to go back in time so picture
the<00:01:53.180> Rubik's<00:01:53.479> Cube<00:01:53.660> at<00:01:53.750> 20<00:01:53.990> moves<00:01:54.170> away

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the Rubik's Cube at 20 moves away

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.469 
the Rubik's Cube at 20 moves away
imagine<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.070> your<00:01:55.250> mind<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:56.000> there<00:01:56.240> were<00:01:56.360> these

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
imagine in your mind if there were these

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.120 
imagine in your mind if there were these
cubes<00:01:56.810> maybe<00:01:57.050> only<00:01:57.440> ten<00:01:57.710> moves<00:01:57.920> away<00:01:58.040> from

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
cubes maybe only ten moves away from

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.940 
cubes maybe only ten moves away from
being<00:01:58.490> mixed<00:01:58.670> up<00:01:59.170> picture<00:02:00.170> at<00:02:00.320> seven<00:02:00.800> what

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
being mixed up picture at seven what

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.469 
being mixed up picture at seven what
you're<00:02:01.130> gonna<00:02:01.220> see<00:02:01.430> with<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.670> cube<00:02:01.910> imagine

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
you're gonna see with the cube imagine

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.850 
you're gonna see with the cube imagine
if<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.690> rubik's<00:02:02.960> cube<00:02:03.080> is<00:02:03.170> only<00:02:03.350> one<00:02:03.649> move

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
if the rubik's cube is only one move

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.680 
if the rubik's cube is only one move
away<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.160> finally<00:02:04.460> in<00:02:04.640> your<00:02:04.850> mind<00:02:05.060> when<00:02:05.570> it's

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
away then finally in your mind when it's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.790 
away then finally in your mind when it's
completely<00:02:06.080> solved<00:02:06.350> let<00:02:06.440> me<00:02:06.530> know<00:02:06.619> when<00:02:06.740> you

now here's the thing as a kid I used to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.500 
now here's the thing as a kid I used to
actually<00:02:54.250> go<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.610> these<00:02:54.760> speeds<00:02:55.150> solving

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
actually go to these speeds solving

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.820 
actually go to these speeds solving
competitions<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.200> would<00:02:56.320> sit<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.710> I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
competitions and I would sit there and I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.050 
competitions and I would sit there and I
could<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.070> would<00:02:57.190> always<00:02:57.430> race<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.880> could

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
could I would always race but I could

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.510 
could I would always race but I could
never<00:02:58.150> win<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.960> had<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.350> cheat<00:02:59.620> is<00:03:00.370> that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
never win so I had to cheat is that

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.790 
never win so I had to cheat is that
still<00:03:00.760> mixed<00:03:01.030> up<00:03:01.150> on<00:03:01.300> all<00:03:01.390> those<00:03:01.510> sides

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
still mixed up on all those sides

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960 
still mixed up on all those sides
perfect<00:03:02.800> now<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.040> turn<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.430> one<00:03:03.580> time<00:03:03.760> it's

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
perfect now if I turn it one time it's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.790 
perfect now if I turn it one time it's
still<00:03:04.120> gonna<00:03:04.240> be<00:03:04.330> mixed<00:03:04.660> up<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:05.380> cheating

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
still gonna be mixed up the cheating

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.260 
still gonna be mixed up the cheating

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
actually got down to millisecond while

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.699 
actually got down to millisecond while
cheating<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.140> I'm<00:03:46.230> going<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.380> show<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.590> the

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
least lose me solving the cube over and

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.110 
least lose me solving the cube over and
over<00:04:03.219> again<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.430> said<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.670> was<00:04:03.790> gonna<00:04:03.879> do<00:04:04.030> it

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
right there watch we'll try to get it to

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.939 
right there watch we'll try to get it to

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.289 

see<00:04:17.949> I<00:04:17.979> didn't<00:04:18.310> say<00:04:18.400> what<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.669> solution<00:04:19.150> was

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
see I didn't say what the solution was

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.560 
see I didn't say what the solution was
this<00:04:19.449> time<00:04:19.720> see<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:19.959> solution<00:04:21.270> was<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.300> get

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
this time see the solution was to get

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.550 
this time see the solution was to get
these<00:04:22.840> two<00:04:23.199> Rubik's<00:04:23.680> cubes<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:25.030> match

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
these two Rubik's cubes to match

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.840 
these two Rubik's cubes to match
completely<00:04:27.030> perfectly

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.850 

now<00:04:34.000> one<00:04:34.300> side<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:34.810> pretty<00:04:35.020> good<00:04:35.290> better<00:04:35.590> than

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
now one side is pretty good better than

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.750 
now one side is pretty good better than
one<00:04:36.220> side<00:04:36.580> would<00:04:37.450> be<00:04:37.630> side<00:04:37.930> number<00:04:38.350> two<00:04:38.760> side

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
one side would be side number two side

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.500 
one side would be side number two side
number<00:04:40.150> three<00:04:40.510> side<00:04:41.230> number<00:04:41.470> four<00:04:41.970> five<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
number three side number four five and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:59.190 
number three side number four five and
all<00:04:43.690> six<00:04:44.080> sides<00:04:44.290> a<00:04:44.560> completely

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.300 

yeah<00:05:01.110> doesn't<00:05:02.110> take<00:05:02.260> long<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.500> say<00:05:02.800> fooled<00:05:03.130> us

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
yeah doesn't take long to say fooled us
