is going to kill you so the only way to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
is going to kill you so the only way to
escape<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> breaker<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.380> once

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
escape it is a to use a breaker so once

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.759 
escape it is a to use a breaker so once
you<00:00:25.650> could<00:00:25.769> use<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> breaker<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.650> there<00:00:28.650> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
you could use a breaker and there you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.599 
you could use a breaker and there you
have<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
have it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.100 
have it
breakers<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.359> absolutely<00:00:30.960> no<00:00:31.199> damage<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.969> and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
breakers do absolutely no damage and and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.670 
breakers do absolutely no damage and and
use<00:00:34.110> two<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.950> three<00:00:34.980> possible<00:00:35.880> bars<00:00:36.840> but

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
use two of your three possible bars but

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
use two of your three possible bars but
they<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.280> completely<00:00:38.730> save<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they will completely save you from the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.190 
they will completely save you from the
combo<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> most<00:00:40.469> cases<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:42.020> how<00:00:43.020> they're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
combo in most cases so how they're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
combo in most cases so how they're
performed<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:45.030> hold<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.629> direction

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
performed is you just hold the direction

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
performed is you just hold the direction
forward<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> hold<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.579> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> same<00:00:48.030> time

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
forward and hold a at the same time

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.790 
forward and hold a at the same time
while<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.079> while<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.620> guard

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
while you're in while you're in guard

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
while you're in while you're in guard
stun<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.700> happens<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.660> uh<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
stun and what happens with that is uh it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
stun and what happens with that is uh it
becomes<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> nice<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.610> option<00:00:53.940> select<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
becomes a nice little option select so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
becomes a nice little option select so
if<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.809> hit<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> guy<00:00:55.199> then<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.100> broken<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
if I hit the guy then I get broken but

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.319 
if I hit the guy then I get broken but
if<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.420> screw<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.960> combo<00:00:58.350> somehow<00:00:59.059> like<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
if I screw up my combo somehow like if I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
if I screw up my combo somehow like if I
if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.570> mess<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.980> later<00:01:02.250> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
if I mess up and then go later you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.950 
if I mess up and then go later you're
still<00:01:02.969> blocking<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.660> you're<00:01:03.780> still

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
still blocking because you're still

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.149 
still blocking because you're still
holding<00:01:04.110> guard<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.650> though<00:01:04.830> you're<00:01:04.949> holding

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
holding guard even though you're holding

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.410 
holding guard even though you're holding
forward<00:01:05.489> you're<00:01:05.700> holding<00:01:05.939> guard<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
forward you're holding guard so you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
forward you're holding guard so you
still<00:01:06.600> block<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.290> nice<00:01:07.470> option<00:01:07.770> select<00:01:08.010> you're

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
still block so nice option select you're

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.410 
still block so nice option select you're
not<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.369> waste<00:01:08.580> meat<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:08.909> anything<00:01:09.210> don't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
not gonna waste meat or anything don't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.880 
not gonna waste meat or anything don't
worry<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.590> never<00:01:10.770> gonna

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
worry about that and you're never gonna

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
worry about that and you're never gonna
want<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> break<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.600> screw<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.200> that's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
want to break it but screw it up that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.420 
want to break it but screw it up that's
not<00:01:13.710> gonna<00:01:13.890> happen

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
not gonna happen

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
not gonna happen
so<00:01:14.970> um<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.170> ways<00:01:16.259> around<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so um there are some ways around it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
so um there are some ways around it
though<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.490> why<00:01:18.240> don't<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.540> hit<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
though so why don't you get hit by the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
though so why don't you get hit by the
second<00:01:19.560> punch<00:01:19.740> after<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.570> break

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
second punch after this and then break

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260 
second punch after this and then break
this<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.530> um<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.250> obviously<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> follow

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this one so um so obviously if I follow

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
this one so um so obviously if I follow
him<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> jump<00:01:24.960> kick<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.979> gets<00:01:26.189> broken

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
him up with a jump kick it gets broken

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200 
him up with a jump kick it gets broken
but<00:01:27.240> check<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.790> get<00:01:29.790> hit<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> punch

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
again grabs cannot be broken a combo

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.179 
again grabs cannot be broken a combo
like<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> general<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.320> try<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> hold<00:01:38.009> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like I need to get out of it now so in

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
like I need to get out of it now so in
that<00:02:01.649> case<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.280> easiest<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.210> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that case the easiest thing to do is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.640 
that case the easiest thing to do is
instead<00:02:03.990> combo<00:02:04.500> into<00:02:04.590> super

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
instead combo into super

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.969 
instead combo into super
now<00:02:05.940> supers<00:02:06.940> cannot<00:02:07.450> be<00:02:07.690> broken<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.740> lot<00:02:08.890> of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
now supers cannot be broken and a lot of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.950 
now supers cannot be broken and a lot of
people<00:02:09.190> ask<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:10.000> know<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.360> complement<00:02:10.900> the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
people ask you know it's complement the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.020 
people ask you know it's complement the
supers<00:02:11.290> worth<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:11.890> high-level<00:02:12.070> plan<00:02:12.520> if<00:02:12.760> in

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
supers worth it in high-level plan if in

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.380 
supers worth it in high-level plan if in
Mortal<00:02:13.360> Kombat<00:02:13.630> 9<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:15.100> my<00:02:15.640> opinion<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.330> is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
Mortal Kombat 9 and in my opinion it is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.800 
Mortal Kombat 9 and in my opinion it is
in<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.410> instance<00:02:17.830> especially<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.570> if

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
in this instance especially if you if

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.720 
in this instance especially if you if
it's<00:02:20.320> going<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> kill<00:02:20.710> them<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.550> now

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
it's going to kill them then do it now

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.150 
it's going to kill them then do it now
the<00:02:22.240> other<00:02:22.570> thing<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.020> note<00:02:23.410> about<00:02:23.560> breakers

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the other thing to note about breakers

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.730 
the other thing to note about breakers

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
can he can break the second hit of my

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.250 
can he can break the second hit of my
combo<00:02:32.980> no<00:02:33.130> problem<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.360> first<00:02:34.960> hit<00:02:35.140> is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
combo no problem but the first hit is

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.730 
combo no problem but the first hit is
still<00:02:35.290> happening<00:02:35.710> so<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.650> an

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
still happening so if you have an

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.380 
still happening so if you have an
opportunity<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.460> an<00:02:39.550> xray<00:02:39.880> combo<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.330> will

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
opportunity for an xray combo that will

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.050 
opportunity for an xray combo that will
leave<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.870> guy<00:02:40.990> with<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.430> hit<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.580> health

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
then his breaker suddenly doesn't mean

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.260 
then his breaker suddenly doesn't mean
anything<00:02:45.310> anymore<00:02:45.490> because<00:02:45.700> he's<00:02:45.910> not<00:02:46.060> able

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270
