00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you have to click on this one this one

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.779 
you have to click on this one this one
so<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.180> move<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.789> then

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so I can move that one over and then

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.740 
so I can move that one over and then
this<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.500> bounced<00:00:25.740> down<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.189> deer

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
this one so bounced down two deer

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
this one so bounced down two deer
shooting<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.590> there<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> go<00:00:29.010> bounce<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> down

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
shooting so there you go bounce it down

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730 
shooting so there you go bounce it down
to<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.750> lines<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
to there now that lines up with that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.280 
to there now that lines up with that
just<00:00:32.430> slightly<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:33.989> down

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
just slightly so this as it was down

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.729 
just slightly so this as it was down
should<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:35.910> connects<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.739> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
should go to there what connects up so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.220 
should go to there what connects up so
levels<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> 17<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> drop<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.930> one

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
levels of 17 you have to drop that one

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
levels of 17 you have to drop that one
down<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.649> dance<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.430> wait<00:00:41.730> quite<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> while

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
down like dance and wait quite a while

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
down like dance and wait quite a while
in<00:00:42.660> two<00:00:42.780> rows<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.129> before<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
in two rows one side and just before it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
in two rows one side and just before it
touches<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.969> box<00:00:45.239> click<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> up<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.320> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
touches that box click it up so it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
touches that box click it up so it
shoots<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> knocks

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
shoots up like that now when it knocks

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.090 
shoots up like that now when it knocks
that<00:00:48.809> block<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> click<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:49.890> oil

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that block you have to click it off oil

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
that block you have to click it off oil
will<00:00:50.309> roll<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.000> knock<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.629> off

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
will roll down and knock that back off

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.760 
will roll down and knock that back off
so<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.250> 17<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so they get that 17 this one you have to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
so they get that 17 this one you have to
line<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.570> lines<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
line it all up so it lines up with the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
line it all up so it lines up with the
holes<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> bottom<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.149> click

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
holes at the bottom so if you just click

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
holes at the bottom so if you just click
on<00:01:00.570> those<00:01:00.780> couple<00:01:01.289> squares<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
on those couple squares in that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
on those couple squares in that
rectangle<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.270> leave<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.719> last<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.409> now

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
rectangle but leave the last one now

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
rectangle but leave the last one now
because<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:05.820> stops<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.270> rolling

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because that was stops it from rolling

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.960 
because that was stops it from rolling
all<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.110> off<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
all the way off so as you can see it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
all the way off so as you can see it
falls<00:01:09.600> down<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
falls down like that what was down and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
falls down like that what was down and
then<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:11.880> connect<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
then it will connect just like that so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.789 
then it will connect just like that so
that's<00:01:16.530> level<00:01:16.890> 18<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.909> 19<00:01:18.450> now<00:01:19.320> first<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that's level 18 now 19 now first you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.550 
that's level 18 now 19 now first you
want<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.909> rid<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.420> bottom<00:01:22.290> square

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
want to get rid of the bottom square

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.490 
want to get rid of the bottom square
like<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.700> left<00:01:23.909> square<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.320> why<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
like that and at left square then why is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.899 
like that and at left square then why is
doing<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> either<00:01:26.369> give<00:01:26.640> her<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
doing that you can either give her the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.910 
doing that you can either give her the
white<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.270> left<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> boat<00:01:27.810> works<00:01:28.200> both<00:01:28.439> ways<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
white or left it boat works both ways to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
white or left it boat works both ways to
me<00:01:29.070> anyway<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> battery<00:01:31.079> charges<00:01:31.409> up

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
me anyway so as the battery charges up

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.499 
me anyway so as the battery charges up
you<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.860> drop<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> battery<00:01:32.579> down<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> as

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you have to drop the battery down and as

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
you have to drop the battery down and as
his<00:01:33.780> slides<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.740> need<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> do

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
his slides down you don't need to do

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
his slides down you don't need to do
anything<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:36.299> automatically<00:01:36.990> connect

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
anything now will automatically connect

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
anything now will automatically connect
that<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> back<00:01:38.549> light<00:01:38.970> bulb<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that and into the back light bulb so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.160 
that and into the back light bulb so
last<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.920> least<00:01:41.090> 20<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
last but not least 20 we have to do

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.859 
last but not least 20 we have to do
don't<00:01:43.740> forget<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> middle<00:01:44.250> r<00:01:44.689> square<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
don't forget the middle r square at the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.530 
don't forget the middle r square at the
bottom<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.770> start<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> ball<00:01:47.700> rolling<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bottom then start the ball rolling and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
bottom then start the ball rolling and
when<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> gets<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.560> middle<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.100> roll

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
when it gets to about the middle I roll

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
when it gets to about the middle I roll
it<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> other<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.320> counter

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it the other way so this counter

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
it the other way so this counter
balancing<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.030> charge<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.570> self

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
balancing then will charge up by self

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
balancing then will charge up by self
line<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> lines<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
line this up so it lines up with the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
line this up so it lines up with the
middle<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.899> give<00:01:58.200> her<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> square

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
middle then we give her the square

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
middle then we give her the square
underneath<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.229> will

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
underneath it and that one so they will

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
underneath it and that one so they will
walk<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.829> bottom<00:02:02.219> still<00:02:02.579> connected<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
walk to the bottom still connected and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569
