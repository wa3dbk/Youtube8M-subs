00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.929
 hello I will explain how 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 extend the life of your toner 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.170
 in any case a simple little thing that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 does not work on my printer 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 brothers buys 51 30 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.640
 So manufacturers are introducing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 toners in the harbor content then he 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 simply remove the toner at Geneva 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.590
 see well it's an honor to be in 33 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.590
 hours for mine it works other 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 printers then simply veil this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 was happening when they sell you and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 cartridges denies the charges not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 completely of them can already the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.520
 shake for some it works but it 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 hangs fast enough if you look good 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 sure your browser 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 see if a small lens it here 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 was just a little hole in the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 material for that laser that is found 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 inside the printer measures the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 level of tons of which just 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 take a black scotch and tape and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 over it so that the laser can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.020
 easy I did not even see just fifteen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:17.159
 coach a little piece of paper and I 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.530
 obscures the little hole that looks like 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.030
 a lens a month it comes 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 I simply introduce my layer map 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:39.040
 10 in the beast 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.390
 and that's it now 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.650
 just enough there was there was 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.180
 something in turmoil so now 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.160
 springs and normally it is a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 crime no problem I had a test for 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.760
 validate 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.799
 here 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.270
 and it's now gone for I do not 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.799
 do not know how many copies but in all 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.250
 case since I did that it works 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.349
 so some say up to 3000 copies 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.030
 that more so do not hesitate to us 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.730
 leave your comments for this little 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.269
 movie and then well we hope that one 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.980
 saves some some content 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.980
 more 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.980
 thank you
