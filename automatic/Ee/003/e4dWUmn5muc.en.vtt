traditional<00:04:59.060> in<00:04:59.180> this<00:04:59.389> dance<00:04:59.660> form<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.860> be

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
traditional in this dance form to be

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.580 
traditional in this dance form to be
showing<00:05:02.210> certain<00:05:02.449> parts<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.110> body<00:05:03.349> that

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
showing certain parts of the body that

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.499 
showing certain parts of the body that
we<00:05:03.740> might<00:05:04.039> not<00:05:04.250> be<00:05:04.430> used<00:05:04.669> to<00:05:04.849> in<00:05:05.000> classical

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
we might not be used to in classical

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.540 
we might not be used to in classical
dance<00:05:05.750> here<00:05:08.199> it's<00:05:09.199> really<00:05:09.620> not<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:09.979> anxious

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
dance here it's really not so anxious

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.480 
dance here it's really not so anxious
that<00:05:11.440> respects<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.590> elements<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.310> belly

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
that respects the elements to belly

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.730 
that respects the elements to belly
dance<00:05:13.789> and<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:14.990> it's<00:05:15.139> important<00:05:15.650> that

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
dance and I think it's important that

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.850 
dance and I think it's important that
women<00:05:16.280> are<00:05:16.820> able<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.330> embrace<00:05:17.870> their

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
women are able to embrace their

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.610 
women are able to embrace their
sensuality<00:05:19.370> but<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.270> definitely<00:05:20.810> not<00:05:20.840> the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
sensuality but it is definitely not the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.680 
sensuality but it is definitely not the
focus<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.849> dance<00:05:23.090> form

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.760 

I<00:05:27.480> think<00:05:28.480> it's<00:05:28.630> really<00:05:29.050> easy<00:05:29.080> for<00:05:29.410> Americans

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
I think it's really easy for Americans

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.770 
I think it's really easy for Americans
to<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.340> misconceptions<00:05:30.970> about<00:05:31.360> other

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
to have misconceptions about other

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.200 
to have misconceptions about other
culture<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:33.220> kind<00:05:33.490> of<00:05:33.580> take<00:05:33.850> them<00:05:34.060> at

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
culture and just kind of take them at

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.690 
culture and just kind of take them at
face<00:05:34.240> value<00:05:34.650> with<00:05:35.650> whatever<00:05:35.920> we<00:05:36.250> see<00:05:36.430> on<00:05:36.550> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
face value with whatever we see on the

and<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.780> dancing<00:05:59.380> and<00:05:59.740> the<00:05:59.820> clothing<00:06:00.820> and

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
and the dancing and the clothing and

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.630 
and the dancing and the clothing and
just<00:06:02.200> so<00:06:02.950> many<00:06:03.160> rich<00:06:03.490> cultures<00:06:05.190> have<00:06:06.190> belly

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
just so many rich cultures have belly

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.820 
just so many rich cultures have belly
dance<00:06:06.970> as<00:06:07.210> an<00:06:07.660> integral<00:06:08.110> part<00:06:08.170> of<00:06:08.620> their

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
everyday routines and life and I think

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.150 
everyday routines and life and I think
it's<00:06:12.640> a<00:06:12.730> really<00:06:13.000> interesting<00:06:13.270> window<00:06:13.810> into

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
it's a really interesting window into

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.160 
it's a really interesting window into
those<00:06:15.160> cultures<00:06:15.730> that<00:06:16.240> starts<00:06:16.660> with<00:06:16.840> dance

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
those cultures that starts with dance

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.170 
those cultures that starts with dance
and<00:06:17.530> then<00:06:17.680> maybe<00:06:17.920> leads<00:06:18.280> to<00:06:18.520> interest<00:06:18.970> in

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
and then maybe leads to interest in

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.090 
and then maybe leads to interest in
other<00:06:19.480> parts<00:06:19.930> of<00:06:19.990> those<00:06:20.140> cultures<00:06:20.620> which<00:06:20.980> i

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
other parts of those cultures which i

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.060 
other parts of those cultures which i
think<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.460> really<00:06:21.790> healthy

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070
