 so I was the professional football player 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.630

 when c is already taken even by lcp 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.630

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 you play in France team 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.760
 I am of Malian origin 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.910
 these mayas 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 Italian dumel this visit to the iaaf 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 but percent what is it 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 there is no better memory 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 there is no worse memory 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.960
 a great memory is to have been able to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.950
 conducted 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.760
 had to actually realize 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 and percent and I never forget that I was a kid 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 the a330 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.510
 and we are at stake I opened a savings account 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 because the mother on typhain saber shots that player when needed 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.510
 cgt explains trainees i'm leaving i'm sport-studying 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.700
 and there in the stadiums on the 300 francs at the time after he is 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.180
 a lot a lot of money in may 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.820
 but percent it's aboulharjan pat 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.209
 hughes it is true that art 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.580
 must know how to handle themselves 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.069
 it's a music that will come 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 that one must pay attention to what can handle for Moscow 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.869
 that trust 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.109
 it's not easy and then 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.389
 it's not necessarily parents who can better manage it's not 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.909
 necessarily 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.930
 but an agent like this is it is very complex party 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.609
 and percent after that of the stents 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.730
 it's very difficult to go from talking about them 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.219
 argan 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.989
 already when it's not yours 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.549
 concerts are not the payers 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.379
 all I can say is that 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.469
 the Argentine will not stop you from being yourself and% and keep your feet 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.479
 on earth 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.199
 and life passes quickly when summer passes 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.679
 I think Spain 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.769
 it is first of all it is the niçois is to pay attention to oneself 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.569
 to his own life 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.519
 at the choice we decided to make 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.089
 money is an engine 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.829
 it is an energy that must be well developed for 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.569
 to enjoy it 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
 I would say at its true value 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.929
 that is, the day of the game 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.109
 I produce and I realize short programs on channel + has passed josé 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.269
 I make documentaries there I prepare a movie 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.329
 on the 2010 world cup and sweat 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.529
 tell the football 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.419
 by the children 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.379
 I do not come back because cbc 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.149
 we talk a lot about the world of adults 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.979
 sometimes children I believe that 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.049
 in this spontaneity and supernatural this primacy to cinema 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.129
 very realistic 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.530
 what our daily rent can represent 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.979
 and our dreams too 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.279
 so here I was lucky to be able to do what I love 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.129
 even when I was a footballer 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.939
 always wanted to do that he makes movies I love the picture 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 that in reality I consider television and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:53.939
 beautiful tool 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.999
 you can very reducer 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 and I'm committed to showing things that are 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.809
 obvious ie spontaneous is true 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.919
 do not hide things without necessarily shocked 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.669
 media of things naturally 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.409
 football is a culture 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.009
 like another craft can 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.639
 it is always a culture and on roots that must be respected 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.219
 forget the old ones 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.150
 listen to them 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.440
 and reliable to prevent the elders from advancing the youngest 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.550
 I think it is 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.409
 we live in a world 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.279
 communication but people therefore necessarily share 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.219
 his skin is a little difficult for young people of them while ronnie 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.889
 tromsoe all 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.809
 there is always a correspondence 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.719
 we have a little trouble 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.719
 to the ball to respect because we forget very quickly and that's it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.610
 all I can say is what he does 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.659
 I think that education 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.659
 education is something very important this 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.189
 it's difficult when you grow up% 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.770
 we respected his parents for example 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.520
 to demystify them because 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.620
 we prefer the parents of others for example advanced season is very 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.659
 delicate 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.809
 I do not have any advice to give when we engage in something without 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.789
 to have honor 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.530
 and the generosity of courage not to have courage 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.009
 especially to save oneself born in Cairo 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.180
 but also at the origin 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 I believe a lot in his values ​​of 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.439
 honor 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.559
 of generosity 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.039
 that's what makes commitment there 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.039
 and not cheated 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.699
 our passion for fishing 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 no in October the entries 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.740
 the isf does not seem far because at the head in the canton as for passersby 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.289
 to escape 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.289
 it is true I would have liked to know when a great traveler 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.759
 because when we travel we meet other people 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.759
 other cultures 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.169
 people very different from us 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.169
 is she so different at once 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.259
 in the human being is not broken at best we are all jobs 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:08.879
 worker the business leader 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.279
 I believe that when we all represent the same 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.219
 somewhere in kapadia no difference 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.219
 and the trip because you received on his testicle 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:23.009
 I do not have much meeting 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.879
 in fact his own 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.710
 culture one learns that oneself in his greenhouse me I note the idate so I speak 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:30.979
 I speak like that 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.330
 because because 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.159
 because I know that 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.159
 but I think it's a bad reflex 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.380
 vim
