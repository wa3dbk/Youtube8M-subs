better<00:01:35.820> overall<00:01:36.479> hopefully<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:37.110> have

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
better overall hopefully doesn't have

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.940 
better overall hopefully doesn't have
the<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.619> any<00:01:37.890> wrong<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.090> occurs<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the out any wrong when it occurs that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.819
