this<00:00:13.959> is<00:00:14.080> what<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.320> base<00:00:14.469> looks<00:00:14.770> like<00:00:14.980> I<00:00:15.160> did<00:00:15.369> a

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
this is what the base looks like I did a

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.939 
this is what the base looks like I did a
tutorial<00:00:15.760> on<00:00:16.209> my<00:00:16.270> very<00:00:16.630> last<00:00:16.720> one<00:00:17.110> was<00:00:17.470> on<00:00:17.680> how

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
made this which is a canvas and we cut

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.790 
made this which is a canvas and we cut
out<00:00:48.190> circles<00:00:48.609> of<00:00:49.359> tissue<00:00:49.569> paper<00:00:49.659> and<00:00:49.929> we<00:00:50.199> use

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
out circles of tissue paper and we use

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.590 
out circles of tissue paper and we use
my<00:00:50.979> clutch<00:00:51.219> to<00:00:51.429> put<00:00:51.670> them<00:00:51.789> onto<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.210> canvas

I<00:01:36.010> prefer<00:01:36.670> my<00:01:36.820> Podge<00:01:37.060> just<00:01:37.420> because<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.720> think

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
I prefer my Podge just because I think

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.900 
I prefer my Podge just because I think
that<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.110> holds<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> glass<00:01:38.740> better<00:01:39.040> but

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
that it holds to the glass better but

that it holds to the glass better but
there<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.180> also<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.510> makeshift<00:01:40.900> Mod<00:01:41.170> Podge<00:01:41.380> by

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
there is also a makeshift Mod Podge by

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.930 
there is also a makeshift Mod Podge by
recipe<00:01:42.160> if<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.400> didn't<00:01:42.670> watch<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.910> last

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
recipe if you didn't watch the last

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.300 
recipe if you didn't watch the last
video<00:01:43.180> it's<00:01:43.480> half<00:01:43.690> Elmer's<00:01:44.290> glue<00:01:44.560> half<00:01:44.920> water

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
video it's half Elmer's glue half water

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.310 
video it's half Elmer's glue half water
so<00:01:45.580> take<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:45.850> bottle<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.270> Elmer's<00:01:46.420> glue<00:01:46.840> and

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
so take your bottle of Elmer's glue and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.750 
so take your bottle of Elmer's glue and
mix<00:01:47.680> it<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.920> same<00:01:48.160> equal<00:01:48.460> amount<00:01:48.700> of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
mix it with the same equal amount of

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.820 
mix it with the same equal amount of
water<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:49.690> keep<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.080> an<00:01:50.170> airtight<00:01:50.530> air

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
water and then keep it an airtight air

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.950 
water and then keep it an airtight air
tight<00:01:51.280> container<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.790> that's<00:01:52.120> pretty<00:01:52.750> much

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
tight container and that's pretty much

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.050 
tight container and that's pretty much
the<00:01:53.110> exact<00:01:53.320> same<00:01:53.350> thing<00:01:53.650> as<00:01:53.770> Mod<00:01:53.920> Podge<00:01:54.130> it

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the exact same thing as Mod Podge it

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.090 
the exact same thing as Mod Podge it
does<00:01:55.270> dry<00:01:55.540> not<00:01:55.870> as<00:01:56.230> glossy<00:01:56.380> it's<00:01:56.740> more<00:01:56.980> than

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
does dry not as glossy it's more than

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.510 
does dry not as glossy it's more than
that

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760 
that
but<00:01:57.760> it<00:01:58.600> doesn't<00:01:58.900> really<00:01:58.990> matter<00:01:59.200> as<00:01:59.440> long<00:01:59.500> as

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
but it doesn't really matter as long as

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.860 
but it doesn't really matter as long as
it<00:01:59.860> holds<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.250> way<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.400> want<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.730> to<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.750> let's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
it holds the way you want it to so let's

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.060 
it holds the way you want it to so let's
go<00:02:01.960> ahead<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.200> get<00:02:02.290> started<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.770> we're<00:02:02.950> gonna

go ahead and get started so we're gonna
take<00:02:03.310> our<00:02:03.550> base<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.690> we're<00:02:05.320> gonna<00:02:05.409> set<00:02:05.650> it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
take our base and we're gonna set it

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.460 
take our base and we're gonna set it
down<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:07.060> I've<00:02:07.480> already<00:02:07.659> cut<00:02:07.780> out<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> bunch<00:02:08.349> of

sheet<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.010> folded<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.340> over<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> bunch<00:05:22.850> of

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
sheet and folded it over a bunch of

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.530 
sheet and folded it over a bunch of
times

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
times

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.000 
times
drew<00:05:23.960> my<00:05:24.080> circle<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.560> I'm<00:05:24.620> going<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.800> cut<00:05:24.980> out

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
drew my circle and I'm going to cut out

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.220 
drew my circle and I'm going to cut out
one<00:05:25.130> of<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.580> circle<00:05:25.880> patterns<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.990> are<00:05:27.110> on

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
one of the circle patterns that are on

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.600 
one of the circle patterns that are on
here<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:28.040> gave<00:05:28.280> me<00:05:28.490> five<00:05:28.700> or<00:05:28.730> six<00:05:29.030> at<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.180> time

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
here it gave me five or six at a time

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.180 
here it gave me five or six at a time
which<00:05:31.610> adds<00:05:31.820> up<00:05:32.000> really<00:05:32.330> quickly<00:05:32.860> if<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.010> get

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
which adds up really quickly if you get

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.340 
which adds up really quickly if you get
bubbles<00:05:34.640> I'm<00:05:35.180> gonna<00:05:35.300> have<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.780> bubble<00:05:36.230> in<00:05:36.320> that

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
bubbles I'm gonna have a bubble in that

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.230 
bubbles I'm gonna have a bubble in that
one<00:05:36.650> just<00:05:37.280> take<00:05:37.370> your<00:05:37.520> finger<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:37.970> smooth

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
one just take your finger and smooth

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.090 
one just take your finger and smooth
that<00:05:38.360> out<00:05:38.420> you<00:05:39.230> can<00:05:39.350> use<00:05:39.470> your<00:05:39.590> sponge<00:05:39.830> to

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
that out you can use your sponge to

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.290 
that out you can use your sponge to
smooth<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.370> out<00:05:40.460> as<00:05:40.640> well<00:05:40.820> if<00:05:41.060> that's<00:05:41.150> not

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
smooth it out as well if that's not

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.760 
smooth it out as well if that's not
working<00:05:41.540> out<00:05:41.780> it<00:05:41.840> has<00:05:42.290> a<00:05:42.320> little<00:05:42.530> bit<00:05:42.650> more

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
working out it has a little bit more

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:51.670 
working out it has a little bit more
force<00:05:42.980> behind<00:05:43.190> it<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:49.930> there<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.080> go<00:05:51.230> it<00:05:51.560> is

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
force behind it and there you go it is

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.470 
force behind it and there you go it is
just<00:05:51.890> that<00:05:52.040> simple<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.670> will<00:05:52.850> dry<00:05:53.030> out<00:05:53.210> and<00:05:53.420> it

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
just that simple it will dry out and it

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.600 
just that simple it will dry out and it
will<00:05:53.570> dry<00:05:53.750> clear<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.470> when<00:05:54.980> you<00:05:55.070> put<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.250> candle

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
will dry clear and when you put a candle

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.370 
will dry clear and when you put a candle
in<00:05:55.730> there<00:05:55.880> it'll<00:05:56.090> glow<00:05:56.300> through<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:57.140> that<00:05:57.170> you

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380
