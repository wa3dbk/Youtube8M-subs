00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.899
 more to see if the rival 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.630
 in him he wanted 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 the regional center 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.970
 of agricultural research 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.980
 from captain miranda 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.630
 the engineer a firmware he 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.950
 shows us the research work 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.400
 that are made in this center 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.420
 by houston mar 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.940
 the problems of the area 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.030
 especially 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 a very big problem that the stream in the area have 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.270
 I was focusing research for 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270
 look for extreme resistance varieties 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.000
 to buy 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.160
 the engineer 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.809
 We are in soybean breeding 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.120
 percent in which 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.530
 We are carrying a soybean plant 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 which was selected already 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.380
 previous year that has one percent ampule plus tolerance 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.850
 a high tolerance and villa to soybean rust as we are saving this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.240
 soybean plant 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.320
 already in are a cover 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 elena or gestating the formation of summers 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 the comparison is that we can raise 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.730
 on this plant 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.930
 and these are 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.580
 as we see here it has a quite a foliage in its era before 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.640
 this sonya resulting 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.680
 of the selection 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 of what we had done in previous years 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.940
 justly 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.570
 people ask me are they doing genetic 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.030
 the ergonomic study of these 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 for the end of the month after defining if they really answer mansion they have solos 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 we're 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.040
 waiting 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.640
 I was talking about a kind of horizontal resistance to soybean rust that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.699
 what we are wanting to do 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:10.670
 pedrosa 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.899
 in which several genes interact 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.009
 to be able to maintain this natural genetic resistance 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.159
 with this we say 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.539
 that the plant can do more 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.539
 but it does not cause economic damage to the producer 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.449
 inclusive 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.179
 to get sick 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.829
 and I arrived until the moment they determine which the product comes to realize the 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.769
 corresponding chemical control but 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.139
 in terms of mind 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.999
 we are talking about and sieberg a police app and harvest the 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:40.799
 soy 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.670
 So the goal is that this soybean plant does not have any treatment 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.239
 tic 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.899
 you do not have advertising that we are here very close to the plots 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.279
 where we have a high 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.159
 the ship that here just brought before all the defeats was seen 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.880
 plants the whole leaf of the plant are present 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.749
 under which he is president 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:05.639
 percent the inc the incidence of the disease is that it's military already entering 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.630
 and the stage of grain formation that's why we say minimum incidence 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.060
 of the bow already as it is moving to little points a crime and in the first 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.880
 plant part of the plant where the prize is being attempted 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.539
 where it is developing 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.979
 we see that pretend 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.170
 the work stalin type of moe sirte 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.969
 yes maybe you can use fungicides but minimally 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.969
 with a police application we estimate that we can reach 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.309
 harvest this area that is not only previously moving the 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.629
 the jewel is clean the mouth 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.509
 he does not have us here we see that they are not zero 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.889
 in the middle mouth that in this stage of the cultivation ahead with this 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.459
 climatic condition we are having with the presence of open rust not that 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.720
 have to do more 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.929
 if in the susceptible belly or genetic material your site 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:52.949
 and hammock 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.939
 the ocam down still 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.309
 some other 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.789
 in pressures if we go 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.759
 on the first sheet 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.899
 still that is the plant silver 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.389
 as we are seeing on screen in this line 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.519
 he has some injuries 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.499
 this 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.969
 prior to insulting by raising the top part of the floor and in what 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.269
 we do not want to keep as many bojan as possible in the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.400
 pri the plant 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.140
 as we are seeing here but deaf in the room the last work that remains 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.379
 the young goose are going to see the lesions that are baiting are 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.309
 minimum the idea of ​​ours is like 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:34.539
 for the same 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.650
 the mister and culture and in the wound 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.870
 despite the timely recommendation for the soybean producer 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.290
 to alleviate the disease in this case they are supported by soybean we know well 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.210
 that the tool available today 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.890
 in Paraguay and in him personally 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.379
 is the use with AIDS 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.930
 nor the glove of manners the medium 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
 in this case as visible as possible 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.069
 we do not say 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.979
 the trial can solve total problems 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.650
 he will help assumption abr protect his judgment every time the conditions 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.899
 that is to the control they are carried out of opportune moment ideal 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.159
 because if we get out of hand there is no miraculous product of four 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.339
 senators etc 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.129
 does not exist 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.169
 ea alternative to the project 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.340
 more than 90% was normalized from the year went to the soybean planting night 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.900
 October for zone 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.090
 nooyi fine October-November goes to the downtown area and its cast that is the best 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.259
 Sowing and harvesting time of paraguay soybean 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.980
 it shows they feel ivana was still showing that 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.070
 we must respect 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.490
 in bread we can only point to tiptoe
