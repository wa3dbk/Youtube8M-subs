 beautiful sexy cain is a rose the more you are 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.190
 of the matt series that you can see 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.190
 why 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.010
 not at all polished and if it could be 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:35.810
 one of that series my lips get color is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.269

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.579

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.389

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:47.480
 to follow or mine but never the former bad bad 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.389
 which is what the first team discovered and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.879
 the last purchase is called fast play ed 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:59.319
 is from the amplified series collection 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:02.329
 therefore very very pigmented and from one 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.209
 long duration I must say really is 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.430
 so pigmented that I don't pass it 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:13.370
 by sentence but also present networks are 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.019
 all the lips but the block and then the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.049
 I like the emblem with the companies 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.000
 the other one I told you is the only one in 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.660
 limited edition but I think it is 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 etc is alive with glam is called cindy 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 we will see a last transparent I avoid 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.530
 it's not like you move me much about colors 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 rosÃ© however sometimes beautiful is that this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.240
 ok 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.459
 let us pass on my passions to the reds 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.320
 then a beautiful Russian that I still have 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:53.190
 are my favorites is this summer 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:57.390
 just shot on what is another matt ed 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.800
 it is a beautiful orange red, but off 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.060
 in the summer that beautiful with the frame 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.860
 certainly nice then we increase a little 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.850
 the warmth of red this is the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.100
 very famous ruby sporting side 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.060
 this too and matt does after a little more than 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.030
 fatigue flows for this very ruby 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.880
 nice real but i always have mine 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.250
 problems 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.710
 peel ok and then we have the other 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.740
 very famous that it was another jean brand 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.600
 red famous and he's crazy and 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:41.950
 if you can see it is a place a bit 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:44.910
 deeper a little more blood it is 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:50.200
 the last one that was a passion 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:55.030
 fabulous is called oar and of the series 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.420
 stasis and is a very dark is one of those 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.500
 colors 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.500
 berna nino this color is beautiful 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:13.450
 that in transit of Bologna is ok 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.890
 beautiful in my opinion because you can 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.800
 just just apply 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:21.210
 very light and leaves a color 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.000
 as if he had just bitten a blackberry 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.840
 or intensely applied comes 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.420
 this color here with a gloss from above 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.120
 in short, an intensity will not be passed 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.940
 certainly unnoticed and the beautiful thing 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.900
 is that when he goes away for example later 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.920
 a dinner leaves a stain on stage that 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.830
 is called 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.560
 which is pleasant in the sense that it seems 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.990
 just maybe we are just a few 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.140
 lips for a while we have a little lips 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.770
 crusades but not one of those spots 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.490
 all appeal to unpleasant patches no 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.940
 absolutely beautiful, in fact I'll tell you more 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.920
 that stain covered with a gloss from 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.920
