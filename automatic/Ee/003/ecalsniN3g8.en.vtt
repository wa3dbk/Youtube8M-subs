00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
strongholds that are cut into like

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.949 
strongholds that are cut into like
ravines<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.069> stuff<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.360> really

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
like this one stronghold that I saw that

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.470 
like this one stronghold that I saw that
was<00:02:26.260> connected<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:27.100> mine<00:02:27.490> shaft<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.120> also<00:02:28.450> I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
was connected to a mine shaft and also I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.090 
was connected to a mine shaft and also I
really<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:28.990> this<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.350> stronghold<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.069> I

strongholds<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.459> are<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.760> absolute

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
strongholds like that are the absolute

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.570 
strongholds like that are the absolute
best<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.720> overall<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:36.010> bit<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.459> an

you can have a fish too alright so I'm
definitely<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.910> terrain<00:03:34.720> generation<00:03:34.900> on

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
definitely the terrain generation on

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.860 
definitely the terrain generation on
this<00:03:35.500> map<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.739> awesome<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.299> got<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
this map is awesome so it's got that and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.170 
this map is awesome so it's got that and
the<00:03:37.930> fact<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:39.040> giant<00:03:39.549> snowy<00:03:39.970> Tundra

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the fact that it's a giant snowy Tundra

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.030 
the fact that it's a giant snowy Tundra
makes<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.750> perfect<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.230> Christmas<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:41.890> it's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
makes it perfect for Christmas so it's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.849 
makes it perfect for Christmas so it's
another<00:03:42.370> amazing<00:03:42.730> Christmas<00:03:43.359> seed<00:03:43.859> another

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
thing that I think could have made it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.430 
thing that I think could have made it
better<00:03:46.030> like<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.390> said<00:03:46.540> earlier<00:03:46.570> was<00:03:47.019> another

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
better like I said earlier was another

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.890 
better like I said earlier was another
pine<00:03:47.739> forest<00:03:48.130> biome<00:03:48.489> but<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> last<00:03:49.450> drawing

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900

extreme<00:03:56.799> Hills<00:03:57.040> bottom<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.549> like<00:03:57.640> a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
extreme Hills bottom so it's like a
