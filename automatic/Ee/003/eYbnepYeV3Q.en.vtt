00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 future winner of the america award 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 I do not know but it is incredible 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.420
 yeah that's a choice the choice I have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.890
 never driven on records 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 smart houses it's not worth 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 great thing you do the 8 franchini 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 time he was half in the emblem not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.279
 did not want too arched and came to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 start of the race everything in place there 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
 go without pressure like that before he has 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 in fact even if jean etienne but 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 he'll never make a mistake when he leaves 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.680
 does a little three jumps like that that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.699
 made known is impressive this is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.320
 that in the last turn and has 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.490
 the impression that they are tidying up and never in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 buy a lung like that he 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 was it's a shock to a priest who did not 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280
 not result he's like that there will 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.079
 the ears 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.149
 sanvensa phenomenon and the filly and the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.579
 super filly it's a great joke 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.530
 also go barred by that one damage 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.940
 but we can see how much difference at the finish he 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.200
 there is still 15 m at the finish with the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.489
 other branches to compromise that she has 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 changed the way the generation in the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.559
 derivatives and supports it was certainly not 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.850
 to embellish shocked he finally colleagues 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.739
 by the teams but I mean they 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770
 have they are not pulled the flounder they have 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.200
 they did the right hand after each 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.880
 each for himself but we lose in the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.870
 turns I felt a little disappointed 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.930
 just now after prices of the Americas 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.930
 but there otherwise frankly I thought not 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.190
 win that no to the adage says we are 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.280
 a little short a month without running 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.050
 in addition to the 5th is great but we 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.820
 could have been 3rd to the 4th may be a 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.979
 great course but he was a little 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.170
 straighten again and then from the first he 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.850
 is yours untouchable outfielders he 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 does a super values I find when 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.140
 same and after the rest in ccd ski 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 a lot it's a crack their down on 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.330
 the rising he scraped a super 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.400
 form 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.750
 here is the daira and roxanne his cracks do not 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.070
 must not be disappointed because he is going to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.869
 pass in the next few months but bob 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.610
 cc riggle the champion of the moment the year 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.100
 next in america you time very 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.330
 or not if he frankly told me 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 would be that I would wait for ballads 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 their pages month will be me I would have 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.910
 not run I have not done for the site is 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.050
 in two weeks, so we have to do 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.360
 be careful things like that are worth 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.320
 does not prevent much even though I have the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.200
 luck we ask to see some great 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.790
 we need to be careful and 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.360
 take your time is rather the run 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.360
 rather in two years
