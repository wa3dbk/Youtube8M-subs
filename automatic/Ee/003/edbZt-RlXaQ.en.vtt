 in the correct part and frequently 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.510
 the teeth can cause 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.029
 bacteria that are normally found 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.430
 in your mouth and that help convert 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.980
 food especially the sugars in 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.019
 bad breath dentists call evil 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.809

 an unpleasant smell from our mouth and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.949
 our breath smells bad can be 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.280
 caused by the types of food that 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.559
 we eat like onion garlic and even the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.989
 tuna or the tacos the people that

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.240
 have an unpleasant breath 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 Candidiasis is an infection of the mouth 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
 and sometimes of the pharynx caused by 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.619
 the yeast fungi and way in not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.390
 brush your teeth and mouth with 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.030
 Frequently provokes it 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.620
 is presented as white material both 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.730
 in the mouth 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.730
 as in the pharynx 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.870
 gingivitis is an inflammation and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 infection in the gums when the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.570
 simple inflammation produces pain the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.850
 Gingivitis appears due to a bad 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.979
 oral hygiene a bad brushing of the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 teeth that allows the development of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 bacteria 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.489
 It can also cause bleeding and to 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.480
 make it clearer here we see a gum 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.280
 given and here a gum with gingivitis 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.030
 we see that it is inflamed and can 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 present bleeding 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 the gums the teeth by the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 accumulation of bacteria 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.700
 all for not washing your teeth well and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 three times a day 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.560
 since it begins to accumulate in the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.170
 teeth after 20 minutes after 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.599
 eat 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.420
 if it is not removed properly with the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.030
 brushing can start 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.400
 this accumulation of bacteria and dirt 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.950
 between your gums and teeth causes others 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.690
 problems such as tartar formation in 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.200
 teeth 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.720
 the car is easily visible because it is 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.270
 a yellowish line in the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 gums or teeth 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.890
 as we see it in the images 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 the decay the bacterial plaque is 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.890
 accumulation of bacteria and dirt goes 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.409
 deteriorating our teeth by 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.530
 acids that this generates this causes 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:27.060
 creation of holes in the teeth 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.489
 like the ones we see in the image 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.130
 If we have cavities we can present 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.989
 Toothache or teeth on 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.380
 all after consuming drinks or 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.110
 sweet or hot food cold the 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.209
 cavities usually do not hurt unless 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.430
 that become very large and affect the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.220
 nerves or cause a tooth fracture 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.800
 the sugars increase the risk of having 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.800
 caries so we must avoid eating 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.420
 so many sweets and if we do not 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.420
 we must forget to brush our teeth 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.829
 what should we do to avoid these 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.079
 diseases we must decrease from 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.629
 our diet the foods with large 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.629
 amounts of sugars like chocolate 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.590
 avoid foods that stick in the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.359
 teeth like chewing gum, soft candy 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.700
 for his prolonged stay in the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.650
 surface of the teeth 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420
 it is also important to brush us 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.000
 correctly the teeth to avoid 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.750
 all these diseases and have a 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 perfect smile
