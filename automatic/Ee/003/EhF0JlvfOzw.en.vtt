00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.660
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.788
And I have a wonderful story for you called "The Fiery Furnace" 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.034
Today's memory verse is from Joshua 24:15

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 It says,  'We will serve the Lord"

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.965
The message for today's story is we worship God when we refuse to do wrong things

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:29.897
 Has anyone ever wanted you do to something wrong? 

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:31.890
 What did you do?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.725
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were asked to do something wrong too 

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:39.260
 It was finished at last

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.165
 The gigantic golden statue King Nebuchadnezzar had ordered to be made stood tall

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:47.160
Tall as an eight story building

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:51.730
 The next day, many rulers who served Nebuchadnezzar gathered in the valley

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.580
They stared up at the huge golden statue 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.280
The rulers also stared at a large furnace near the statue

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.811
Soldiers were building a big fire in it

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:06.080
'Why are they doing that?', the people whispered

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.600
Finally, a man stood before the crowd 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.210
'People!', he shouted, 'Listen to the King's command.'

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.440
'When the musicians play, you must bow down and worship the king's golden statue.'

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.870
'Anyone who doesn't obey will be thrown into this blazing furnace.' 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.600
 Suddenly the music burst forth. Everyone fell down. 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.190
Everyone except Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.662
 They couldn't worship a statue!

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:35.520
Some men saw them and hurried to the king

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:40.137
'Look!', they exclaimed. 'Those three Hebrews did not bow down!'

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.622
King Nebuchadnezzar's face turned red with anger

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.725
'Bring them here!', he ordered.

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:47.794
The guards rushed to obey

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:53.714
'You did not bow down to worship the golden statue!', the king shouted at the three Hebrews

00:01:54.228 --> 00:02:00.388
'I will give you one more chance! Worship the statue or you will be thrown into the blazing fire!' 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.228
'Who will help you then?'

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.685
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stood straight and tall

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:11.314
'O king', they said, 'Our God is able to save us' 

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:16.514
'But even if he decides not to, we will never worship your gods' 

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:22.788
'Make the fire 7 times hotter!', King Nebuchadnezzar shouted angrily at the soldiers

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:25.680
'Tie up these men and throw them in the furnace!'

00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:30.891
So the guards threw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the roaring fire

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.360
King Nebuchadnezzar watched the fire

00:02:33.714 --> 00:02:38.320
He soon jumped up and shouted 'Didn't we put three men into the furnace?'

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.925
'I see four men, and the fourth looks like the Son of God'

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.708
'Shadrach! Meshach! Abednego! Come out!', the king called

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:53.360
The young Hebrews stepped out of the fire. The rulers crowded around

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.320
They couldn't believe it! Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were not burned

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.810
They didn't even smell like smoke!

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.462
'Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego!', the king exclaimed 

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:13.017
'Their God saved his servants from the fire. No god can save people like this.'

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:28.148
