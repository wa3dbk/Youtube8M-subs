00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.649
 hello to all kids who are such today 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.349
 already good we are here again a 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.090
 curro which kraft to walk already again 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.800
 incarnated himself 7 for those who 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.440
 they teach nothing of the dummies guys of 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.230
 there now I want to show you something 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.420
 well you want is already the function of 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950
 armor is now worth as you know has 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.289
 caste changed the mechanism to 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.630
 punish the incredible ones I'm going to 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460
 teach more or less what what they are 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.330
 ok let's make the first armor 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 of frost 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 if you remember until what I was doing 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 reduce the damage they did to you and perform 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
 the goal when they hit you is worth now 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.410
 output as if it has been increased by 5% 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.120
 attackers slowed down as you can see 13 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.080
 % you left so I increase it to 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 take away the doctor 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.350
 Yes, it increases us. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.970
 Armor you give as I already spent and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.210
 well when they hit you, you give up the 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.890
 objectives 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.270
 I think you do not have to explain anything 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 let's go through the second one that is the one 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 cast iron 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.610
 is the best blow increase to your 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 movement slows down by 30% for 5 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.479
 seconds in which we are that is the one of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.170
 pig iron increases a blow 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.600
 critical 5% reduces duration of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.460
 all the harmful physical effects used 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.460
 against you 25% 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.730
 harmful physicists I do not know what you mean 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.670
 I assume it will be in plan 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.670
 garrote the gift of garrote break 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.040
 the sun that leaves the neighborhood forgives that no 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.250
 I remember the name and such and it increases the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.190
 critical so it will be being the glyph of 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.320
 magician by himself and the last glee was that 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.450
 magician's armor 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.670
 this is going to be the glyph of the magicians 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.220
 Fierce when they are not spotlights or cocks 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 leave a little bit free or when you can go 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.240
 free as they will carry this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.830
 almost always 90 of the time 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 increases the expertise five points and 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.440
 duration of all the magical effects of 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.980
 35 percent is still more or 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 less equal against thousands critics is going to 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.630
 increase the damage and against casters 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.910
 basically it's still the same 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.490
 the expensive mechanics did not leave you critical and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.920
 master and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.090
 I think that everything is very clear and the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.420
 last measure of experience in this 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 video is the least the channel infuses 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.050
 speed to all group members 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.440
 or band that increases its power successfully 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.810
 10 percent and your probability of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.810
 critical blow 5 percent 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.840
 It's worth critical 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.030
 to successfully critical 56 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.890
 percent but as there is 5 percent 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
 of critics already gives us intellect as 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.310
 See if at home I take it next in 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.480
 house no longer of intellect now the subject is 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.879
 whether we are looking for right now is 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.650
 the vein to see right now I have written 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.299
 with all critical it is critical in the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.730
 Pussy is the written critic was fine 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.110
 there 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.160
 age who have 21% of rage 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.160
 26 31 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.569
 well here you know what God does 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.840
 rapporteur little joke 5 of critics 5 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.150
 critical objects and reduces such 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.430
 forgive good you know the armors 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 what they do and change the number 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.260
 approach that no longer give you intellect 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.760
 I repeat and nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.069
 this little video also remembers 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.090
 give you like favorites we see the 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.090
 next video see you later
