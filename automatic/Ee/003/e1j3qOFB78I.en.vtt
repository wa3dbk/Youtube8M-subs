00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everybody, we're here in a house that 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 edson touch with montane and visiting the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.030
 Brazil and this is a great home for 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.769
 show how the structure works by 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.320
 behind which we come to the house a 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 very different American house and I was just 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 now you have learned all things and will 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 explain to us here how the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.519
 American drywall explains to us there by 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.890
 favor is the American drywall it to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.859
 similarity of Brazil is also made a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.410
 million gypsum and with the surface 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.620
 where on top of that in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.230
 surface is placed to texture to give 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 the final finish and is totally stuck 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.700
 in the structure of wood that supports 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 It's the tram. This is where the whole party is. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.850
 the ava is then is constructed with this 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 wood structure in the interior is very 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.910
 easy to change these pieces here is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.589
 What's the name of the drug in English? 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.689
 of this thickness really that people 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.119
 see here in the video so if the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.820
 people have a small part in the house that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.970
 needs to be fixed let's say problem 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 plumbing agent would cut a hole 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.689
 here to see what 's going on with the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.270
 leak that maybe we 're having 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.790
 here in the same water route 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.460
 thing on the roof of the house 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.400
 if we have it it's all chic rock 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.250
 also the same type and here then if the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.850
 people need to cut for example how 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.729
 To fix this, we 'd cut a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 a piece outside would put a new chip 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.750
 exchange with the drywall there would make the texture 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.210
 that we are using at home so it is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 leave as the name does not give to see 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 no difference to africa as how 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.619
 it's no different, it's what you 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.960
 think that any advantage of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 build this way I think 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 the maintenance does not think extremely 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.619
 simplify you do not have to work 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.720
 difference of the houses in Brazil are 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.789
 masonry where the very 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.550
 work hard here much more 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.260
 simple and quick to make up to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.920
 on account of the workforce here that is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.900
 much more expensive for me to fix as the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.550
 people are this our home to us 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.920
 purchase has not been or has not been 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.220
 Fixed to fix for example 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.830
 this wall here that looks terrible to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.440
 Improve the vision of this here I go 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 need two pieces and schipplock 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.090
 that costs me $ 18 each I go 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.090
 having to remove this here is the hand of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.519
 Let's assume that everything is okay. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.390
 plumbing such that electricity from the 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.820
 first down is ok then with 16 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.950
 dollars to people exchange oxy drug us 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.850
 Let's screw them here on this wood. 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.370
 and then make a texture over the top 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.530
 to look beautiful then what? 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.650
 more will cost is labor with 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.760
 approximately 150 200 dollars 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.440
 this gets like new so a good 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 why not shared here as 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.610
 things work , I think this house is 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.030
 a great example to show how the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.030
 things here
