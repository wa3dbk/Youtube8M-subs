00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
wheel treatment and I've seen pictures

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.410 
wheel treatment and I've seen pictures
of<00:00:48.519> this<00:00:48.790> here<00:00:50.339> I've<00:00:51.339> seen<00:00:51.580> press<00:00:51.909> photos<00:00:52.299> of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420

these<00:00:52.540> wheels<00:00:52.780> from<00:00:53.199> Volkswagen<00:00:53.799> it<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.040> is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
these wheels from Volkswagen it this is

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.840 
these wheels from Volkswagen it this is
I<00:00:54.309> think<00:00:54.339> this<00:00:54.580> is<00:00:54.699> a<00:00:54.729> base<00:00:55.000> model<00:00:55.379> item<00:00:56.379> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I think this is a base model item and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.549 
I think this is a base model item and
now<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.909> more<00:00:58.390> upscale<00:00:58.690> models<00:00:59.170> get<00:00:59.290> nicer

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
now the more upscale models get nicer

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.759 
now the more upscale models get nicer
wheels<00:00:59.769> but<00:01:00.010> this<00:01:00.580> is<00:01:00.760> such<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.750> is<00:01:02.440> such<00:01:02.619> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
Volkswagen is done here and I'm really

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.630 
Volkswagen is done here and I'm really
not<00:01:56.500> sure<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:56.770> I'm<00:01:56.890> capture<00:01:57.220> into<00:01:57.400> some<00:01:57.550> video

but<00:01:57.940> it's<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.120> really<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> much<00:01:58.960> sleeker

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
but it's a really is a much sleeker

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.140 
but it's a really is a much sleeker
platter<00:01:59.710> sporty<00:02:00.520> you're<00:02:00.580> looking<00:02:00.640> car

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.680 

and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.020> think<00:02:06.200> they've<00:02:06.320> done<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.530> beautiful<00:02:06.950> job

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
and I think they've done a beautiful job

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.650 
and I think they've done a beautiful job
redesigning<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> beetle<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.290> I<00:02:10.660> certainly

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
redesigning the beetle and I certainly

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.790 
redesigning the beetle and I certainly
hope<00:02:11.810> they<00:02:11.960> put<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.380> as<00:02:12.500> much<00:02:12.530> attention

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
hope they put just as much attention

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.020 
hope they put just as much attention
into<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> engineering<00:02:15.370> because<00:02:18.430> ina<00:02:19.430> would
