00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 with you appleinsider.ru my name is Natasha 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.279
 and today we look not even on 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.440
 accessory 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.330
 she is a freestanding device which 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 due to their tasks someone can 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 seem very specific but 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 its price and use 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.859
 looks interesting to any person 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 with a creative streak 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.250
 this is a pen for three-dimensional printing under 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250
 whether the name will come 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.960
 shipped device in a small 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.750
 carton box where you can find 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.760
 the very power supply handle to it and 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.620
 several plastic packages of different 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.720
 flowers as soon as possible 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.850
 characterize as test material 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.460
 the handle is a rather thick device with 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 fan power adapter connector 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780
 for cooling heaters with a hole 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.780
 under plastic rods a pair of buttons for 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.800
 plastic feed rate adjustment 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.600
 melt outlet nozzle 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.729
 material and slider inclusion 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.160
 shutdown after powering up the network three 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.440
 understudy takes time to warm up so 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.479
 that the print will not work right away but after a couple 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.979
 minutes the indicator will change from red to 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.590
 green and you can proceed 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.810
 at first we just put a sheet on the table 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.660
 paper and just tried to draw well 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.820
 what happens is not very much if 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.259
 honestly the pictures that were found under 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.880
 hand categorically did not want 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.950
 become somewhat voluminous 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.890
 bent stretched and behaved extremely 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.930
 worthy but on the manufacturer's website 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.300
 managed to find stencils that can 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.580
 try to recreate not only simple 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.289
 but also quite complex objects and if 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.240
 flat stencil your own 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.950
 itâ€™s pretty hard to create from 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.819
 individual details something real in 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.399
 three-dimensional world 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.350
 occupation is very exciting for our 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.450
 tests we chose the stencil of the bike and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.459
 started off with a frame making a few 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 test samples although I am very 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.840
 I tried, I was completely desperate, but 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.220
 then something began to turn out and i 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.319
 I drew this and then got down to the frame and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.819
 then got to the wheels in the end 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.280
 it was such a transport 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.540
 means which then my colleagues in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.330
 voluntary-compulsory 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.430
 added in the trunk pedals and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.470
 a bottle of water and it turned out 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.160
 such a thing as for me so very 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.160
 nice 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.780
 the end of the process handle is pretty strong 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.579
 heated tip nozzle so general 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.510
 categorically does not accept touch 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.340
 work process 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.989
 because the fan cools only 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.090
 internal heaters for melting 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.159
 plastic but the whole process turned out 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.709
 quite fascinating and if after a couple 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.959
 the first curves of the cubes do not throw the handle 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.760
 in the far corner of the navel it is quite possible 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.739
 there were birds and if professional 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.870
 tasks in prototyping and the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.700
 such difficult words we are in this form 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.769
 decided not to mention the fact that those who 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.810
 piece buy for such purposes know 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.849
 why do they take you for development 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.189
 spatial thinking in children to 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.319
 the example of 10 years, we would have it with me 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.659
 recommended benefits that price around 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.000
 100 dollars allowing such a gadget as 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.769
 3d pen get we thank 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.299

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.109
