my first 1142 montage okay enough of the
color<00:00:37.050> correction<00:00:37.559> thing<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
color correction thing so back to the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
color correction thing so back to the
game<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.440> i<00:00:40.650> am<00:00:40.739> using<00:00:41.220> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
game as you can see i am using the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.479 
game as you can see i am using the
increased<00:00:41.910> field<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.390> view<00:00:42.600> thing<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.489> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
increased field of view thing and I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.570 
increased field of view thing and I
never<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.330> liked<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.309> setting<00:00:47.309> before

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
never really liked this setting before

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.910 
never really liked this setting before
because<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.750> made<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:48.930> guns<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.530> really

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
because it made the guns look really

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
because it made the guns look really
fucked<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.310> like<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.120> l96<00:00:51.690> has<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.020> huge<00:00:52.320> ass

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
fucked up like the l96 has this huge ass

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.850 
fucked up like the l96 has this huge ass
back<00:00:52.890> end<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.840> did<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
back end that I really did not like the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
back end that I really did not like the
look<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.510> okay<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.540> mean<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:58.140> increase

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
look of and okay I mean an increase

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
look of and okay I mean an increase
field<00:00:58.860> of<00:00:59.040> view<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.430> montages<00:01:00.210> or

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
field of view in your montages or

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.990 
field of view in your montages or
gameplay<00:01:00.860> accentuates<00:01:01.860> that<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.220> play<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.550> PC

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
gameplay accentuates that you play on PC

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
gameplay accentuates that you play on PC
and<00:01:03.030> stuff<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.649> really<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.160> like

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and stuff but I just really do not like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
and stuff but I just really do not like
the<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.640> guns<00:01:05.850> look<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the way the guns look but on the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.820 
the way the guns look but on the
psychological<00:01:08.729> benefit<00:01:09.690> however<00:01:09.899> of<00:01:10.410> having

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
psychological benefit however of having

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.300 
psychological benefit however of having
smaller<00:01:11.190> crosshairs<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.210> immense<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:13.310> if

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
smaller crosshairs is just immense is if

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
smaller crosshairs is just immense is if
you<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.850> example<00:01:14.940> my<00:01:15.509> akimbo<00:01:15.960> CZs<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you take for example my akimbo CZs that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910 
you take for example my akimbo CZs that
I<00:01:16.920> use<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.280> light<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.560> slide<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> fan

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I use with light off and slide a fan

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.830 
I use with light off and slide a fan
Stefan<00:01:20.990> don't<00:01:21.990> care<00:01:22.170> whatever<00:01:22.640> yeah<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.119> if

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
Stefan don't care whatever yeah so if

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
Stefan don't care whatever yeah so if
you're<00:01:25.080> using<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:26.100> crosshairs<00:01:26.520> are

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you're using that the crosshairs are

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.430 
you're using that the crosshairs are
bound<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.090> bigger<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> course<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:28.289> you

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
bound to be bigger of course because you

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.570 
bound to be bigger of course because you
don't<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.649> steady<00:01:28.920> aim<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:31.220> now<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
don't have steady aim on but now that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.919 
don't have steady aim on but now that
the<00:01:32.729> crosshairs<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.270> smaller<00:01:33.569> with<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
the crosshairs are smaller with the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.699 
the crosshairs are smaller with the
increased<00:01:34.259> field<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.830> view<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.459> can<00:01:36.289> well<00:01:37.289> in

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
increased field of view you can well in

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.320 
increased field of view you can well in
point<00:01:38.039> in<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.429> way<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.429> spray<00:01:41.429> down<00:01:41.670> people

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
point in a way and spray down people

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.809 
point in a way and spray down people
watching<00:01:42.600> easier<00:01:43.020> because<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.399> crosshairs

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
watching easier because your crosshairs

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.750 
watching easier because your crosshairs
are<00:01:45.000> smaller<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.690> like

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
are smaller you like

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.540 
are smaller you like
focus<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.910> on<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.750> better<00:01:49.220> now<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.400> your

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
focus it on them much better now if your

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.340 
focus it on them much better now if your
cross<00:01:50.730> eyes<00:01:50.940> were<00:01:51.150> bigger<00:01:51.420> sure<00:01:51.840> you'd<00:01:52.050> still

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
cross eyes were bigger sure you'd still

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
cross eyes were bigger sure you'd still
get<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:52.650> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> center<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
get them in the center but but but but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.680 
get them in the center but but but but
uh<00:01:55.370> I'm<00:01:56.370> just<00:01:56.640> rambling<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.120> about<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.510> now

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
uh I'm just rambling on about it now

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.650 
uh I'm just rambling on about it now
because<00:01:58.260> I<00:01:58.650> really<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.700> what<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.630> say

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
because I really don't know what to say

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.590 
because I really don't know what to say
I<00:02:01.220> just<00:02:02.220> find<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.760> better<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.120> play<00:02:03.420> with

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
I just find it better to play with

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.900 
I just find it better to play with
that's<00:02:03.840> about<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.310> look<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> guns

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910
