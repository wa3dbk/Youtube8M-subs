00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:18.450
 when the rumors of the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.990
 feature that has most surprised the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.990
 maker 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.700
 finally it has been exactly like that 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.460
 it's a model because it stands out 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.450
 for its design and here on the side 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450
 right of the main screen 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.110
 talking about benefits always 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.110
 terminal usually works 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.580
 exactly like the galaxy note in 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.060
 this case we find a 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.060
 phone 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.860
 3 gigas of ram and 32 gigas of 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.270
 internal storage that can be 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.580
 expand through 128 5 on your screen 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.190
 remains the same 5 seriously as well 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.750
 as for the quality of the benefits and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.510
 exactly hardware features 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.770
 equal to consult a situation 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.320
 problem that the one found with regard to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.880
 design although you can check what 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.369
 has also from the same frames 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560
 general the back cover also 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.869
 polycarbonate factory although according to 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.430
 the leather as not a three or four and in 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.290
 this case I have a quality of 4 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.540
 pretty superior life 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.160
 The first thing we have noticed is that if 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.380
 no four is thicker than usual 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.170
 in this case of thickness reaches the others 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.940
 with 13 and the weight function of this in 4 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.260
 degrees to me personally does not bother me 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 I know there are many people who can 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.780
 bother another problem there is some 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.290
 people who are Kurds and like me the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.080
 phone what is to take advantage of the lateral 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.420
 five militants pass by and what 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.720
 you take a right so you can stay 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:12.280
 all of us to make the video more 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:15.819
 comfortable we will use the take will not be 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.159
 operative as expected 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.800
 is finishing 44 under the layer all very 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.220
 Korean manufacturer 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.960
 regarding the lateral but for functions 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.550
 which are the most interesting you can 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.620
 check on possibilities series of the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.100
 camera contacts to access 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.100
 to the images 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.160
 if we give the notes principles so 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.920
 hidden if we go with the finger 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.680
 we will see in this step they are covered or 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.260
 tell parts to twitter the temperature 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.000
 et cetera if we go up and enter the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.690
 settings 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.620
 administers panels 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.239
 you will see that we can administer 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.239
 what options do we want to appear 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.380
 I'm going to do a little bit more so that what 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.820
 See you can check 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.270
 because you are putting the new 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.860
 options 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.470
 also with another subject that is quite 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.510
 interesting what I think can 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.020
 give more pull to that screen theme 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.760
 of the final 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.300
 with a video we were supported by a 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.300
 test video 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:28.590
 the whole screen for the video 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.870
 and if you want anything without 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.170
 bother the screen could by 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.080
 example 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.080
 pause because move on to the next video 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.790
 4 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.510
 also has fingerprint sensor 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.270
 fingerprint heart rate sensor 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.770
 the main novelty of the 24 diesel is 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.390
 strong ultraviolet rays 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.620
 they will be and we look in the street 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.620
 we would have to medication 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.690
 yes 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.690
 who are not asked to need 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.389
 we would be for sale 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.729
 and he would tell me how many rays 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.860
 ultraviolet as you can check 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.449
 android if you judge the guy for you 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.199
 good has not gone under by company 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.610
 it has come out high 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.230
 obviously this does not have any kind 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.810
 of value 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.810
 we are in a closed initially 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.290
 specified 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:23.910
 in September and the price of 149 euros 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.759
 ah
