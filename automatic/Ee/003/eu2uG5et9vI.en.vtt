00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.760
 First of all, thank you for this interview, for receiving us and being here in Brazil. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.760
 What does it mean for you to be here in Brazil today after competing in Mr. Olympia 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.420
 in such a short space of time? 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.480
 First I would like to say thank you to all the people of Brazil for receiving me so well, 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 showing great affection. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220
 This is my second time in Brazil and second time in SÃ£o Paulo. 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 I'm having a good time here. 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.340
 Bodybuilding, Fitness, Figure and Bikini is really taking off in Brazil. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.060
 People here have great genetics and great potential, as you can see among professionals. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.720
 You see several TOPS athletes who are from Brazil. 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.360
 So it really is a place that has been becoming prominent for bodybuilding. 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.720
 Looking at the market here in Brazil, 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.320
 not just the bodybuilding market, but the market for supplements, 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 What is your view of the current scenario? 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.840
 I think the Brazilian market is not yet fully developed. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300
 It just started to be developed. 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.420
 I think that in the next 10 years you will see the Brazilian market developed as the American market. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.440
 I believe that people will become more fitness, with a fitness mind and conscious about it, 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880
 then we'll see the fitness market and add-ons explode here. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.320
 In relation to the last Mr. Olympia, 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 What do you think about the results? How do you think the competition was? 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 What do you think about your participation in the event? 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.580
 Personally, I believe I was in one of the best conditions of my life. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880
 Even though ... You know ... 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.360
 In bodybuilding you have to be the best you can. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.400
 The battles against himself. 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 Although I have not finished as well as in the past, 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.040
 I was very happy with my conditions on stage, 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 I've done everything I could do and the rest is out of your hands. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.780
 I believe the competition was generally approved and Phil deserved to win. 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.020
 Not only did it look really good as its quality was of the best, 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 as we have seen in the past and he still possesses. 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 He deserved to win. 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.160
 Looking to the future, what does Brench Warren see that will happen? 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.780
 Think about continuing to compete for how long? 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 Or even stop? 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 Do you have something in mind about the future? 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.620
 I thought I'd be retired at that point, 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.620
 but I'm still healthy and having fun, 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.280
 I'm still one of the top athletes, I still stand in the top 5 or 6 in the world, 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.620
 so I'll keep competing. 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.920
 I love bodybuilding and have the opportunity to travel all over the world. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.520
 I've been all over the world, I have friends all over the world, 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.960
 So I can live my dream. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.620
 There are few professional bodybuilders who could take advantage of the success I enjoyed, 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.880
 So I'll follow as much as I can. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.780
 I was saying at the beginning of the interview 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.120
 that you are known as the most hardcore athlete currently in bodybuilding, 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.600
 because you take hardcore to the limit. 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.520
 We see you training at Metroflex, 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.400
 you have a well-kept life, 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.320
 you do not live in the spotlight like other athletes 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080
 Brennan Warren, internally, with the family, is he the same hardcore guy? 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.320
 How is Brench Warren with the family ...? 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.880
 No ... The Brench Warren at home ... He leaves it all at the gym, you know ... 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 When I'm at the gym with my teammates, Johnny and everyone, you do what you have to do, 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.320
 be the best, but ... 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.420
 When you go home, you let it go. 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.240
 You do not take it home, 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.600
 so I'm a different guy when I'm at home with my family, my daughter ... 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.360
 but when I go to the gym 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.240
 IT'S THE ZONE OF WAR!
