00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.890
 Dr 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.449
 Dr 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.409
 Dr 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.220
 many people naturally ask themselves in Germany 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.619
 this is an injury visit moment out to 40 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.750
 at the moment I'm not fit I'm in pain said Stegner 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.479
 Münch and of course that I can get fit in time 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.080
 why Ascom -6 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.950
 So much discussion about injury area injuries 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.519
 bruises 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.539
 Broder Achilles tendon courses are themselves said that's a very accurate one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 more of my Achilles tendon is the rice 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.970
 and that is of course very painful 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.750
 he adjusts to traffic himself 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.780
 of course, positive things that will be fine again 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 and hope that I can play against Turkey again 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.040
 you have already heard yesterday it is of course one 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.400
 incredible hype about his person 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.610
 Mesut özil Bundestag and the EU also more often was here as a coach 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.930
 Activist in with Russes about that all people are so fixated on you 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.560
 racist of course i am of course glad that i am in Istanbul and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.380
 Mister, very nice city 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 and the atmosphere will of course be great and we look forward to that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.960
 competition 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.710
 it was so remembered in berlin-wedding operas what he did nice sport where 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.550
 I latella with Nutella myself 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.680
 is almost so scared of the sight at his sight 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.890
 Box so that's also a sign of appreciation for you for your good 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 I'm not afraid of more power 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.880
 of course, percent 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 I think the fourth like to come back 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.840
 but I can live with that 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.540
 if professional enough 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.020
 I do not mind that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.670
 it's so turning the typical cases so this is a sunshine 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.810
 I soon the relationship on the one hand 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.680
 They admire you because you also have one of the biggest clubs at Real Madrid 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.770
 the world gameplay then but of course it's all sad 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 Percent of course for Turkey, she plays the one to the other 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.310
 also rather positive are the people 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 I am very positive on the road that he is positive we are very proud of myself 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.680
 that too 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.119
 I myself have no negative 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.429
 he noticed you noticed 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.849
 as so often in Berlin is the most important but otherwise was the demolition 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.479
 careful 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.929
 He should be put in such a stadium 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.959
 If you get that, what kind of feeling does that feel? 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.109
 Even so, an incentive or burden is to depress an ass 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.629
 you do not get that part anymore 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.299
 if the referee China then you focus on the place that 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.040
 a Christian first communicated only at the corner balls or one may Benedict 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.370
 then you get out there where else is anyway concentrated and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.549
 Recife with 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.079
 the BCEE is difficult because now the German team had qualified 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:45.840
 grandiose 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.420
 Qualification played how hard is it to motivate yourself now when 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 you actually have two players like that for the two teams 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.480
 but important for a person are not so important or how 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.620
 How do you find the motivation especially if you are in the clubs 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.549
 important player has 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.079
 Of course our goal is to win every game in this case 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.559
 but know 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.599
 as we said before, we want to win every game 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.459
 I think that has not yet managed a German national team 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.729
 infront of us 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.209
 and of course our goal is to win the last two games yet 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.169
 and start in opposition that we can do it 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.989
 Farewell, of course, a question that interests Nati all German fans 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.689
 Us mother MByte about Real Madrid 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.740
 Are you satisfied third in third place 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.939
 Jülich only Timo Mensa good 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.480
 and of course I am your Manfred Spenner
