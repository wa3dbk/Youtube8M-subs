00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.260 
so why don't you just start affirming
the<00:01:43.950> truth<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.310> who<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.700> instead<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the truth of who you are instead of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.300 
the truth of who you are instead of
comparing<00:01:45.720> yourself<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> idea<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> who

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
comparing yourself to the idea of who

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
comparing yourself to the idea of who
you<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.700> should<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.390> comparing

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you think you should be or comparing

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
you think you should be or comparing
yourself<00:01:48.960> worse<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.649> others<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> then

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
yourself worse to others and then

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
yourself worse to others and then
despairing<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> good<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> move

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
despairing it's not a good way to move

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
despairing it's not a good way to move
through<00:01:52.590> life<00:01:52.619> people<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:54.090> amazing

through life people you are amazing

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
through life people you are amazing

could<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.120> show<00:02:42.390> or<00:02:42.600> okay<00:02:43.049> listen<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
could be on that show or okay listen the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.110 
could be on that show or okay listen the
interesting<00:02:44.310> thing<00:02:44.370> about<00:02:44.519> everything<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
interesting thing about everything that

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.309 
interesting thing about everything that
I'm<00:02:45.209> teaching<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> great<00:02:46.110> living

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
I'm teaching and I'm a great living

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.410 
I'm teaching and I'm a great living
example<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.000> work

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
example of it you just have to work

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.900 
example of it you just have to work
incrementally<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.580> belief<00:02:50.880> system

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
incrementally so if your belief system

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.660 
incrementally so if your belief system
does<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.630> support<00:02:52.260> huge<00:02:52.860> quantum<00:02:53.430> leaps

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
does not support huge quantum leaps

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.009 
does not support huge quantum leaps
right<00:02:53.850> now<00:02:54.180> although<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:54.630> everything

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
right now although that's everything

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.990 
right now although that's everything
that<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.230> teaching<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:56.100> if<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> doesn't<00:02:56.580> then

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
that I'm teaching but if it doesn't then

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
that I'm teaching but if it doesn't then
don't<00:02:57.239> take<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.600> quantum<00:02:58.049> path<00:02:58.260> take<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
don't take the quantum path take the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.460 
don't take the quantum path take the
small<00:02:59.400> incremental<00:03:00.299> journey<00:03:00.600> which<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.260> keep

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
small incremental journey which is keep

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.370 
small incremental journey which is keep
your<00:03:01.500> beliefs<00:03:02.040> smaller<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:03.239> are<00:03:03.480> doable<00:03:03.780> so

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
your beliefs smaller that are doable so

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.690 
your beliefs smaller that are doable so
if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.799> really<00:03:04.950> believe<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.549> be

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
