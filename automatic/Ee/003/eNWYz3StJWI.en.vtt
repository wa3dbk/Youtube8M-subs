controlled manner now to do this we need

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.670 
controlled manner now to do this we need
two<00:00:13.620> routines<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.519> first<00:00:14.790> routine<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.450> P<00:00:16.049> om

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
two routines the first routine is P om

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.500 
two routines the first routine is P om
now<00:00:17.340> P<00:00:17.760> R<00:00:17.789> M<00:00:18.050> stands<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.199> prepare<00:00:20.510> observation

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
now P R M stands for prepare observation

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.160
