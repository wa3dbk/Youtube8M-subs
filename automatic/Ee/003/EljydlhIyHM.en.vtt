00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
code for PSN okay guess how many times
something<00:01:39.420> works<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.900> first<00:01:40.170> time<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.590> try

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
something works the first time you try

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.450 
something works the first time you try
it<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> code<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.020> 0<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.649> 0<00:01:43.680> times

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it when you code it 0 there are 0 times

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
it when you code it 0 there are 0 times
when<00:01:44.759> someone's<00:01:45.060> coated<00:01:45.390> something<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.869> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
when someone's coated something and it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
when someone's coated something and it
worked<00:01:46.079> perfectly<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> fully<00:01:47.759> expect<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
worked perfectly so I fully expect that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.780 
worked perfectly so I fully expect that
when<00:01:48.479> PSN<00:01:48.960> does<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:49.979> whenever

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
when PSN does actually go up whenever

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
when PSN does actually go up whenever
that<00:01:51.060> may<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.750> may<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that may be and it may be you know

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.660 
that may be and it may be you know
slowly<00:01:52.799> over<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> course<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> next

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
slowly over the course of the next

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
slowly over the course of the next
couple<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.119> weeks<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> work

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
couple of weeks it's not going to work

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.200 
couple of weeks it's not going to work
properly<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.759> bugs<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
properly there's going to be bugs that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.249 
properly there's going to be bugs that
need<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.540> fixed<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> have

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
need to be fixed there's going to have

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.249 
need to be fixed there's going to have
to<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> testing<00:01:59.130> period<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.780> Sony

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.679 
is really not going to have a beta
release<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
many customers were disappointed right

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.010 
many customers were disappointed right
now<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.969> been<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.780> long

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now because it's been down for so long

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
now because it's been down for so long

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
but you need to understand that that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.969 
but you need to understand that that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
even if PlayStation never went up right

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.660 
even if PlayStation never went up right
