to do is set the helicopter with the
electronics<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:57.950> thought<00:00:58.310> it's<00:00:58.490> a<00:00:58.580> good

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
electronics so I thought it's a good

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.930 
electronics so I thought it's a good
idea<00:00:58.880> that<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.330> shoot<00:00:59.660> this<00:00:59.810> video<00:01:00.489> about<00:01:01.489> how

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
idea that I shoot this video about how

idea that I shoot this video about how
do<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.010> about<00:01:04.309> my<00:01:04.580> own<00:01:04.850> way<00:01:05.360> of<00:01:05.390> setting

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
do it's all about my own way of setting

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.260 
do it's all about my own way of setting
the<00:01:06.140> helicopter<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.250> if<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.790> doesn't<00:01:08.090> match

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
the helicopter so if it doesn't match

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.090 
the helicopter so if it doesn't match
with<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.840> other<00:01:09.080> professionals<00:01:09.770> out<00:01:10.070> there

other professional guys a way of setting
up<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.320> helicopter<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:19.040> does<00:01:19.250> not<00:01:19.400> matter

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
up a helicopter it does not matter

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.200 
up a helicopter it does not matter
because<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.869> just<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.740> way<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.220> set<00:01:23.060> up<00:01:23.090> my

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
because it is just the way I set up my

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.290 
because it is just the way I set up my
helicopters<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.590> here<00:01:24.830> we<00:01:24.950> go<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.610> can<00:01:25.850> see

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
helicopters so here we go so you can see

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.200 
helicopters so here we go so you can see
that<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:27.590> servos<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:28.250> no<00:01:28.490> servo<00:01:28.880> arms

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
that right now servos have no servo arms

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.350 
that right now servos have no servo arms
on<00:01:29.420> them<00:01:29.570> okay<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.590> swashplate<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.910> also

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
on them okay and swashplate is also

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.859 
on them okay and swashplate is also
hanging<00:01:33.229> free<00:01:33.790> everything<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:35.270> because

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
hanging free everything is out because

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.540 
hanging free everything is out because
we're<00:01:36.170> gonna<00:01:36.320> send<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> stuff<00:01:37.009> there's<00:01:37.280> lots

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
we're gonna send the stuff there's lots

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.210 
we're gonna send the stuff there's lots
lot<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.150> do<00:01:38.300> actually<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.229> note<00:01:39.740> down<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> few

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
lot to do actually so I note down a few

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.520 
lot to do actually so I note down a few
pointers<00:01:40.640> here<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.330> we<00:01:41.840> will<00:01:41.990> go<00:01:42.170> step<00:01:42.500> by

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
pointers here and we will go step by

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.300 
pointers here and we will go step by
step<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.050> accordingly<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.470> first<00:01:45.680> step<00:01:46.070> is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
step so accordingly the first step is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.230 
step so accordingly the first step is
get<00:01:46.790> your<00:01:47.000> radio<00:01:47.150> okay<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.530> I'm<00:01:48.619> gonna<00:01:48.800> get<00:01:49.039> my

his acrobatic model for electric TG
sixty<00:02:09.679> two<00:02:09.920> edge<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.610> t-rex<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.950> think<00:02:13.100> I

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
sixty two edge and t-rex so I think I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.750 
sixty two edge and t-rex so I think I
will<00:02:13.850> use<00:02:13.880> model<00:02:14.630> five<00:02:15.640> okay<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:18.760> will

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
will use model five okay and I will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.050 
will use model five okay and I will
simply<00:02:20.470> reset<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.650> data<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.490> one<00:02:22.730> first

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
simply reset the data on this one first

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
simply reset the data on this one first
because<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.650> trends<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
because we want all the trends and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.860 
because we want all the trends and
everything<00:02:25.520> all<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.970> programming<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.690> be

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
everything all the programming to be

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.740 
everything all the programming to be
none<00:02:28.360> okay<00:02:29.390> data<00:02:29.630> reset<00:02:30.220> then<00:02:31.220> we<00:02:31.459> go<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
none okay data reset then we go to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.990 
none okay data reset then we go to
choose<00:02:32.750> helicopter<00:02:35.709> move<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.280> name<00:02:37.459> let

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
choose helicopter move to the name let

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.570 
choose helicopter move to the name let
us<00:02:38.120> do<00:02:38.330> it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.640 

oh<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:50.320> right

oh all right

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.060 
oh all right
now<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.250> will<00:02:51.520> go<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.180> next<00:02:52.330> option<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:56.070> it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
now we will go to the next option and it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.220 
now we will go to the next option and it
will<00:02:57.100> select<00:02:57.400> three<00:02:57.640> circles<00:02:58.210> 120<00:02:59.200> degrees

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
will select three circles 120 degrees

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.710 
will select three circles 120 degrees
ops<00:03:02.230> -<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.800> will<00:03:02.980> put<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.460> gyro<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.540> can

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
ops - I will put it to gyro so I can

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.870 
ops - I will put it to gyro so I can
control<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.230> gyro<00:03:05.470> sensing<00:03:08.610> rest<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.820> will

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
control the gyro sensing rest I will

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.220 
control the gyro sensing rest I will
just<00:03:10.210> leave<00:03:10.360> them<00:03:10.600> alone

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.870 

okay<00:03:14.230> let's<00:03:15.040> turn<00:03:15.490> it<00:03:15.610> off<00:03:15.780> turn<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:17.700> okay

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
okay let's turn it off turn it on okay

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.240 
okay let's turn it off turn it on okay
so<00:03:19.240> we<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.540> everything<00:03:19.840> here<00:03:20.320> we'll<00:03:20.710> check

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
so we have everything here we'll check

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.280 
so we have everything here we'll check
if<00:03:21.460> we<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.910> got<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.570> menus<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:22.960> we

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
if we have got all the menus that we

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.470 
if we have got all the menus that we
need<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.980> gyro<00:03:27.220> sensing<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:28.030> which

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
need we have the gyro sensing that which

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.630 
need we have the gyro sensing that which
we<00:03:28.720> needed<00:03:28.990> actually<00:03:29.440> okay<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:29.980> rest<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:30.460> all

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
we needed actually okay a rest is all

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.510 
we needed actually okay a rest is all
good<00:03:31.080> now<00:03:32.080> that<00:03:32.290> we<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.560> set<00:03:32.830> everything<00:03:33.130> I

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
good now that we have set everything I

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.180 
good now that we have set everything I
will<00:03:33.700> double-check<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:36.210> put<00:03:37.350> all<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.830> trends

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
will double-check and put all the trends

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.760 
will double-check and put all the trends
to<00:03:39.220> Center<00:03:39.880> okay<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.960> rest<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.710> the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
to Center okay and rest of the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.260 
to Center okay and rest of the
programming<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.490> will<00:03:42.640> leave<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:42.940> alone<00:03:43.210> for

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
programming I will leave it alone for

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.450 
programming I will leave it alone for
now<00:03:43.540> now<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.260> second<00:03:44.740> thing<00:03:44.770> we<00:03:45.010> need<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.190> do

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
now now the second thing we need to do

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.840 
now now the second thing we need to do
on<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.000> second<00:03:46.360> step<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.950> power<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
on the second step is to power on the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.570 
on the second step is to power on the
servos<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.630> they<00:03:49.810> all<00:03:49.989> will<00:03:50.320> go<00:03:50.560> Center<00:03:51.310> and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
servos so they all will go Center and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.910 
servos so they all will go Center and
I'm<00:03:52.209> gonna<00:03:52.330> do<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.660> now<00:03:52.810> after<00:03:53.290> powering<00:03:53.680> on

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
I'm gonna do it now after powering on

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.949 
I'm gonna do it now after powering on
the<00:03:54.070> servos<00:03:54.489> when<00:03:54.700> all<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:55.090> them<00:03:55.270> are<00:03:55.330> centered

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the servos when all of them are centered

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
the servos when all of them are centered
we<00:03:56.500> are<00:03:56.620> going<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.070> install<00:03:57.430> these<00:03:57.940> servo

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
we are going to install these servo

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.660 
we are going to install these servo
horns<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.890> third<00:04:00.340> step<00:04:00.730> comes<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
horns then the third step comes is to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.720 
horns then the third step comes is to
balance<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.300> swash<00:04:04.570> level<00:04:05.530> it<00:04:05.650> out<00:04:05.800> by<00:04:06.430> making

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
balance the swash level it out by making

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.000 
balance the swash level it out by making
sure<00:04:06.940> these<00:04:07.480> connecting<00:04:08.110> rods<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.680> three<00:04:08.890> of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
sure these connecting rods the three of

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.610 
sure these connecting rods the three of
them<00:04:09.250> are<00:04:09.550> of<00:04:09.790> equal<00:04:10.150> size<00:04:10.720> especially<00:04:11.470> these

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
them are of equal size especially these

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.890 
them are of equal size especially these
two<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.340> third<00:04:12.580> one<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.330> helicopter<00:04:13.540> is

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
two the third one on this helicopter is

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.140 
two the third one on this helicopter is
a<00:04:13.989> longer<00:04:14.380> one<00:04:14.530> because<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.010> servo<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.940> third

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
a longer one because the servo the third

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.800 
a longer one because the servo the third
servo<00:04:16.720> fear<00:04:17.230> is<00:04:17.470> actually<00:04:18.340> lying<00:04:18.609> so<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.239> means

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
servo fear is actually lying so it means

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.990 
servo fear is actually lying so it means
the<00:04:20.080> longer<00:04:20.290> one<00:04:20.620> while<00:04:21.100> these<00:04:21.340> servers<00:04:21.880> are

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
the longer one while these servers are

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 
the longer one while these servers are
standing<00:04:22.510> position<00:04:22.960> will<00:04:23.140> take<00:04:23.320> vertically

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
standing position will take vertically

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.840 
standing position will take vertically
position<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.540> will<00:04:26.200> keep<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.490> will<00:04:27.669> keep

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
position so I will keep so I will keep

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.010 
position so I will keep so I will keep
this<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:29.070> very<00:04:30.070> equal<00:04:30.520> size<00:04:30.760> while<00:04:31.480> this<00:04:31.780> one

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
this to very equal size while this one

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
this to very equal size while this one
we<00:04:32.530> will<00:04:32.650> keep<00:04:32.890> for<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.940> stock<00:04:34.180> setup<00:04:34.419> as<00:04:34.690> it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
we will keep for the stock setup as it

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.260 
we will keep for the stock setup as it
is<00:04:35.050> now<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.620> later<00:04:36.160> we<00:04:36.370> need<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.790> probably

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
is now and later we need to probably

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.940 
is now and later we need to probably
increase<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.990> length<00:04:38.200> or<00:04:38.470> decrease<00:04:38.800> the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
increase the length or decrease the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.100 
increase the length or decrease the
length<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.400> these<00:04:39.640> connecting<00:04:40.120> rods<00:04:40.330> in<00:04:40.810> order

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
length of these connecting rods in order

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.440 
length of these connecting rods in order
to<00:04:41.260> make<00:04:41.440> sure<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:42.280> swashplate<00:04:42.580> levels<00:04:43.270> out

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
to make sure the swashplate levels out

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.770 
to make sure the swashplate levels out
horizontally<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.850> also<00:04:45.850> make<00:04:46.030> sure<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.270> set

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
horizontally and also make sure to set

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.220 
horizontally and also make sure to set
the<00:04:47.440> right<00:04:47.919> pitch<00:04:48.580> curves<00:04:48.910> okay<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:50.050> might

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
the right pitch curves okay so we might

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.350 
the right pitch curves okay so we might
get<00:04:50.410> back<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.800> these<00:04:50.950> ones<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.610> increase<00:04:52.000> and

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
get back to these ones to increase and

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.510 
get back to these ones to increase and
decrease<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.720> length<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.200> these<00:04:53.400> after<00:04:54.400> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
decrease the length of these after the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.600 
decrease the length of these after the
swash<00:04:54.729> has<00:04:55.000> set<00:04:55.270> up

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
swash has set up

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.300 
swash has set up
then<00:04:56.030> we<00:04:56.240> will<00:04:56.389> do<00:04:56.599> it<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.379> test<00:04:57.770> if<00:04:57.979> all

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
then we will do it like a test if all

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.950 
then we will do it like a test if all
the<00:04:58.490> servos<00:04:58.849> are<00:04:59.030> moving<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.389> right<00:04:59.539> direction

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
the servos are moving in right direction

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.230 
the servos are moving in right direction
and<00:05:00.229> finally<00:05:00.949> we<00:05:01.069> will<00:05:01.189> go<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.639> set<00:05:01.909> the<00:05:02.060> pitch

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
and finally we will go and set the pitch

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240 
and finally we will go and set the pitch
curves<00:05:02.539> so<00:05:02.990> let<00:05:03.289> me<00:05:03.439> do<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.740> things<00:05:03.919> step<00:05:04.219> by

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
curves so let me do the things step by

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.290 
curves so let me do the things step by
step<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.819> keep<00:05:05.000> shooting<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.509> video<00:05:07.270> okay<00:05:08.270> so

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
step and keep shooting the video okay so

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.830 
step and keep shooting the video okay so
I<00:05:08.569> put<00:05:09.080> all<00:05:09.349> the<00:05:09.530> servers<00:05:09.919> on<00:05:10.099> my<00:05:10.280> DX<00:05:10.729> sevens<00:05:11.270> a

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
I put all the servers on my DX sevens a

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.050 
I put all the servers on my DX sevens a
our<00:05:12.250> 6200<00:05:13.250> rx<00:05:14.240> receiver<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:16.340> can<00:05:16.490> hear<00:05:16.729> I

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.480 

will<00:05:20.060> leave<00:05:20.479> the<00:05:20.810> sticks<00:05:21.169> Center<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.129> all<00:05:22.340> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
will leave the sticks Center and all the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.399 
will leave the sticks Center and all the
trims<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.909> Center<00:05:23.270> that<00:05:23.629> means<00:05:23.900> all<00:05:24.229> the

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
trims to Center that means all the
