00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.999
 I 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.839
 Of course, we have to go on with the different conditions 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.140
 must consider climatic conditions for the reason 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.780
 we around the world test round shapes of us are also Flickr about 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 France hover at the Nürburgring 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 people take 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 He would be snowing his for his words and very sensitive 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.530
 Systems have been very well coordinated 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.350
 have to be 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.610
 if a little weird worry and problems the word comes up 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 have the Untersberg 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.280
 the actual inventor or drunk alcohol 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420
 the mistrust of the mountain we come very well would show the complexity 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.570
 meanwhile systems have to master 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 how about my foot right foot on the brake 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 in the moment where I mean chaos 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.540
 Désirée system continues to maintain the highest 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.790
 and so long 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.560
 until the engine takes over and otherwise 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.980
 the cards will be 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 so that's my role 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.060
 the testers the doctors mainly in the car Veit Broder especially 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.630
 takeover 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.530
 However, they will let some people do it in the early morning 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.930
 Men have to read Berne when the songs were made as a victim lawyer in the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.089
 Program sequence will be there 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:27.899
 For his new life, we want to take and become organizations 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 the 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.319
 and if it works like that 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.259
 instead of 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.259
 from HUS 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.019
 now you will see who to vote on 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.499
 not a few readers optimally master 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.509
 if they still need such breaks again the 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.159
