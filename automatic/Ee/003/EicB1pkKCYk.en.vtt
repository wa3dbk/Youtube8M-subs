I'm<00:01:48.550> doing<00:01:48.730> it<00:01:49.000> since<00:01:49.240> 1990<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.230> that<00:01:50.590> becomes

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
I'm doing it since 1990 and that becomes

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.920 
I'm doing it since 1990 and that becomes
a<00:01:51.160> clean<00:01:51.430> clean<00:01:51.760> clean<00:01:51.790> car<00:01:52.390> after<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.810> do

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
a clean clean clean car after you do

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.880 
a clean clean clean car after you do
that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.060 
that
coal<00:01:55.610> burning<00:01:55.940> power<00:01:56.270> plant<00:01:56.710> not<00:01:57.710> true

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
coal burning power plant not true

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.100 
coal burning power plant not true
because<00:01:58.400> most<00:01:58.640> your<00:01:58.850> charging<00:01:59.360> is<00:01:59.479> off-peak

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
because most your charging is off-peak

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.960 
because most your charging is off-peak
you<00:02:00.740> know<00:02:00.860> you're<00:02:01.070> gonna<00:02:01.159> lesson<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:01.640> tell<00:02:01.850> me

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
you know you're gonna lesson you tell me

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.460 
you know you're gonna lesson you tell me
you<00:02:02.060> work<00:02:02.210> at<00:02:02.360> an<00:02:02.479> all-night<00:02:02.720> pharmacy<00:02:03.170> a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
you work at an all-night pharmacy a

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.710 
you work at an all-night pharmacy a
24-hour<00:02:04.159> donut<00:02:04.550> shop<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.060> know<00:02:05.450> you're<00:02:05.630> gonna

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
24-hour donut shop you know you're gonna

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.210 
24-hour donut shop you know you're gonna
sleep<00:02:06.050> at<00:02:06.229> night<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.619> drive<00:02:06.800> during<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.130> day

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
sleep at night and drive during the day

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.980 
sleep at night and drive during the day
so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:07.880> most<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.179> your<00:02:08.240> charging<00:02:08.750> at<00:02:08.840> night

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
so you do most of your charging at night

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.840 
so you do most of your charging at night
a<00:02:09.020> very<00:02:09.229> efficient<00:02:09.709> time<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.069> use<00:02:10.190> power<00:02:10.459> and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
a very efficient time to use power and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.610 
a very efficient time to use power and
it's<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.840> know<00:02:11.870> there's<00:02:12.170> many<00:02:12.290> ways<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it's just you know there's many ways to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.350 
it's just you know there's many ways to
make<00:02:13.010> power<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.490> can<00:02:13.640> make<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.910> from<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.209> you

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
make power you can make it from when you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.270 
make power you can make it from when you
can<00:02:14.540> make<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.780> from<00:02:14.870> solar<00:02:15.170> sadly<00:02:16.010> had<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.160> lot

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
can make it from solar sadly had a lot

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.100 
can make it from solar sadly had a lot
of<00:02:16.310> powered<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.240> does<00:02:17.390> come<00:02:17.660> from<00:02:17.810> coal

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
of powered now it does come from coal

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.530 
of powered now it does come from coal
but<00:02:18.620> there's<00:02:18.830> all<00:02:19.070> these<00:02:19.250> nearly<00:02:20.120> free

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
but there's all these nearly free

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.270 
but there's all these nearly free
electrons<00:02:21.080> being<00:02:21.350> produced<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> time

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
be wasted much of the day that you can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.570

other biofuels from agricultural waste
not<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.739> make<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.010> from<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> corn<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.700> could

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
not to make it from the corn that could

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.150 
not to make it from the corn that could
feed<00:03:26.030> human<00:03:26.750> beings<00:03:27.079> but<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.680> make<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.950> from

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
the corn stock and other cellulose so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.800 
the corn stock and other cellulose so
there's<00:03:31.430> lots<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.790> good<00:03:31.940> ways<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.150> make<00:03:32.510> fuel

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
there's lots of good ways to make fuel

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.140 
there's lots of good ways to make fuel
biofuels<00:03:33.709> lots<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.489> good<00:03:34.640> ways<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.820> make

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
biofuels lots of good ways to make

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.670 
biofuels lots of good ways to make
electrons<00:03:35.660> so<00:03:35.959> we<00:03:35.989> don't<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.560> be

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
electrons so we don't have to be

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.190 
electrons so we don't have to be
beholden<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.190> Middle<00:03:37.910> East<00:03:38.090> oil<00:03:38.329> if<00:03:38.660> we<00:03:39.019> make

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
beholden to Middle East oil if we make

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.460 
beholden to Middle East oil if we make
the<00:03:39.320> right<00:03:39.440> choices<00:03:39.739> today<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.930> future<00:03:42.350> of

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
the right choices today the future of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.819 
the right choices today the future of
clean<00:03:42.680> transportation<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.910> think<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.930> going<00:03:45.769> to

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
clean transportation I think is going to

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.920 
clean transportation I think is going to
be<00:03:45.980> many<00:03:46.190> things<00:03:46.280> it'll<00:03:46.820> be<00:03:46.940> multifaceted<00:03:47.540> I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
be many things it'll be multifaceted I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.160 
be many things it'll be multifaceted I
think<00:03:48.140> we<00:03:48.260> should<00:03:48.440> get<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:50.450> think<00:03:51.079> we

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
think we should get you know I think we

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.930 
think we should get you know I think we
should<00:03:51.380> get<00:03:51.500> some<00:03:52.010> of<00:03:52.040> our<00:03:52.250> power<00:03:52.489> from

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
should get some of our power from

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.319 
should get some of our power from
biofuels<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.780> think<00:03:54.350> we<00:03:54.470> should<00:03:54.880> power<00:03:55.880> some<00:03:56.180> of

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
biofuels I think we should power some of

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.120 
biofuels I think we should power some of
our<00:03:56.450> vehicles<00:03:56.930> electrically<00:03:57.680> with<00:03:57.859> clean

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
our vehicles electrically with clean

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.699 
our vehicles electrically with clean
power<00:03:58.630> there's<00:03:59.630> many<00:03:59.840> different<00:04:00.109> tools<00:04:00.530> in

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
power there's many different tools in

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.080 
power there's many different tools in
the<00:04:00.799> toolbox<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.400> think<00:04:01.609> we<00:04:01.670> need<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.940> make

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
the toolbox and I think we need to make

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.150 
the toolbox and I think we need to make
our<00:04:02.239> homes<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.660> offices<00:04:03.019> more<00:04:03.290> efficient<00:04:03.739> so

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
our homes and offices more efficient so

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.369 
our homes and offices more efficient so
we<00:04:04.190> free<00:04:04.519> up<00:04:04.550> a<00:04:04.760> lot<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:05.030> electrons<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:06.110> that

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
we free up a lot of electrons now that

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.620 
we free up a lot of electrons now that
you<00:04:06.470> have<00:04:06.709> all<00:04:06.739> these<00:04:07.129> cars<00:04:07.459> with<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> plug<00:04:08.060> you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
you have all these cars with a plug you

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.570 
you have all these cars with a plug you
the<00:04:08.780> opportunity<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.560> save<00:04:09.800> electricity<00:04:10.010> in

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
the opportunity to save electricity in

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.010 
the opportunity to save electricity in
your<00:04:10.640> house<00:04:10.880> by<00:04:11.120> making<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.600> house<00:04:11.750> more

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
your house by making your house more

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.380 
your house by making your house more
energy-efficient<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:12.890> then<00:04:13.430> use<00:04:13.940> those<00:04:14.180> same

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
energy-efficient and then use those same

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.240 
energy-efficient and then use those same
electrons<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.080> saved<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.500> power<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.800> vehicle

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
electrons you saved to power a vehicle

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.330 
electrons you saved to power a vehicle
so<00:04:16.700> now<00:04:16.880> electricity<00:04:17.780> which<00:04:18.470> didn't<00:04:18.860> used<00:04:19.250> to

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
so now electricity which didn't used to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.190 
so now electricity which didn't used to
have<00:04:19.520> a<00:04:19.580> big<00:04:19.850> effect<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.360> foreign<00:04:20.750> oil<00:04:20.870> has<00:04:21.170> a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
have a big effect on foreign oil has a

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.870 
have a big effect on foreign oil has a
huge<00:04:21.620> effect<00:04:21.980> on<00:04:22.100> foreign<00:04:22.460> oil<00:04:22.550> because

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
huge effect on foreign oil because

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.570 
huge effect on foreign oil because
there's<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.240> many<00:04:23.300> cars<00:04:23.660> with<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.900> plug<00:04:24.490> well<00:04:25.490> II

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
there's so many cars with a plug well II

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.010 
there's so many cars with a plug well II
