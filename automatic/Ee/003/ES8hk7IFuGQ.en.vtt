00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
see this world again in the sequel so
the<00:01:16.890> book<00:01:17.070> starts<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.140> foreword<00:01:19.140> by

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the book starts off with a foreword by

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.530 
the book starts off with a foreword by
the<00:01:19.590> director<00:01:20.189> himself<00:01:20.369> genndy<00:01:21.060> tartakovsky

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the director himself genndy tartakovsky

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
the director himself genndy tartakovsky
and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.380> also<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.130> throughout

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and you also get to see throughout

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
and you also get to see throughout
sketches<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> he<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:24.990> done<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> think

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
sketches that he has done so I think

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
sketches that he has done so I think
that's<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.009> cool<00:01:26.220> cuz<00:01:26.520> some<00:01:26.729> directors

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that's really cool cuz some directors

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's really cool cuz some directors
aren't<00:01:27.390> necessarily<00:01:27.750> artists<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.680> but

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
aren't necessarily artists some are but

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
aren't necessarily artists some are but
he<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.060> clear<00:01:30.299> vision<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:30.960> some

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
he had a very clear vision of what some

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
he had a very clear vision of what some
of<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.350> characters<00:01:31.770> wanted<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> look<00:01:32.280> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
of these characters wanted to look like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
of these characters wanted to look like
so<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.600> cool<00:01:33.810> every<00:01:34.020> once<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so it was it really cool every once in a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
so it was it really cool every once in a
while<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.280> tidbits<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.909> him

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
while to see just little tidbits of him

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
while to see just little tidbits of him
and<00:01:36.570> his<00:01:36.720> style<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.009> different<00:01:38.220> than

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and his style which is so different than

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
and his style which is so different than
most<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> people<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> book<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.380> the

most of the people in the book now the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.069 
most of the people in the book now the
book<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.220> simple<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.479> divided<00:01:42.930> into

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
book is very simple it's divided into

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
all over the place and that is so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.370 
all over the place and that is so
fascinating<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:23.300> me<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.570> see<00:02:23.780> at<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.050> point<00:02:24.230> he

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
fascinating to me to see at one point he

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.810 
fascinating to me to see at one point he
was<00:02:24.530> really<00:02:24.770> huge<00:02:25.070> one<00:02:25.340> time<00:02:25.490> he<00:02:25.610> was<00:02:25.730> really

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.390 
was really huge one time he was really
skinny<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.630> hair<00:02:26.990> did<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.800> just<00:02:28.160> thought

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
skinny and hair did not I just thought

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.340 
skinny and hair did not I just thought
it<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:29.030> great<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.450> every<00:02:30.080> character

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
it was really great and every character

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.520 
it was really great and every character
you<00:02:30.620> know<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.160> forward<00:02:31.730> has<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.840> sort<00:02:33.440> of

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you know going forward has that sort of

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.230 
you know going forward has that sort of
development<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.190> get<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.520> see<00:02:34.700> okay<00:02:35.030> how<00:02:35.210> are

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
development you get to see okay how are

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.700 
development you get to see okay how are
we<00:02:35.450> playing<00:02:35.690> around<00:02:35.870> with<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.290> did<00:02:36.530> this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
we playing around with this we did this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.320 
we playing around with this we did this
we<00:02:36.920> tried<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.610> didn't<00:02:37.880> work<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.120> tried

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
we tried that that didn't work we tried

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.900 
we tried that that didn't work we tried
this<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:39.380> once<00:02:39.830> they<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.010> finalize<00:02:40.730> on

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
this and then once they do finalize on

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.340 
this and then once they do finalize on
what<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.180> character<00:02:41.540> looks<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.320> are
