00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.650
 the nec men had five weeks of rest 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.269
 but they will be back on their feet again 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.129
 and he has more than 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.630
 also people feel like in the next 4 weeks 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.910
 are all about preparation 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.860
 on the new season trainer alex 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.169
 pastor trains with his selection on it 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.169
 sport complex want en series in wych-el 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.020
 as long as the to get back to work 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.240
 going today 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.750
 well i didn't do much of course 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.100
 but after a vacation we also recommend one 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.830
 it is always whole again 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.890
 nice to start and how were the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.340
 was the fitness of the players after his 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.140
 first day 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.090
 You don't see that much in the course of the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.700
 preparation then stack the fatigue 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.390
 and then you can do it better 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.070
 judge 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.250
 I also thought you were precise today 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.100
 could see who is really on vacation 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.320
 did the best and whoever with it 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.820
 program has taken a sip 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.710
 why did I tell you that as a trainer 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.930
 then pay attention 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.430
 after it's easy to say that 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.810
 if we do wadlopen work they 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.910
 shocks at the back 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.040
 well that is kind of like that 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.060
 especially at the times when it is there 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.790
 must be played 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.850
 yes then you should be especially keen on van 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.190
 be a ghost and you can see that in the one 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.970
 a little better for each other and with 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.380
 the other 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.180
 did you specially train for anything? 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 today 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.860
 no it is fairly general though 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.660
 we do look at it is especially at the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.500
 new boys that behave and you 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.270
 what 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.880
 what is their natural behavior to see 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.619
 get in some last party you 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 of saying well because you are going nowhere 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.300
 but I would like to see what their 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 natural behavior is in position 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.869
 in which they also play the fair 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 said that the quality of the field what 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.610
 to be desired but I think 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.210
 I really like training in this area 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.670
 nice why because you are always six 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.260
 days and also long in the weather in stadium 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.030
 you do it all season so if you have one 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.920
 times a different environment it can 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 very refreshing work 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.980
 In addition , our own 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.459
 training fields can last a while 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.709
 save so you have some benefits 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.650
 you also have to drive for it so there is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.320
 will be a disadvantage but whether you have a point 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.270
 drive to or to point b that that car 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.220
 does the work days in the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.840
 period from 8 to 13 July the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 training that is given 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.780
 interrupted for a training camp 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.360
 guarantee 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.310
 the team will also play in the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.080
 new home shirt for the present 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.600
 supporters this was the first 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 moment until the new nec at home or 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.890
 Performs could be purchased to be fanatic 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.370
 fans who were already watching that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.440
 from 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.670
 I certainly think it is the outing now 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.430
 love a ticket I love 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.810
 a little traditional shit that dark 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.370
 I think radiate power 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.870
 the one with yes which I personally do quite well 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.750
 very good match 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.850

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.200
 proud of the selection yes i am myself 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.110
 we were hopeful and beginning of the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 season and I bet on a picture myself 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.160

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.510
 we can go into preparation 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.459

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.720
 at nec say the fields to it 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.849
 renovating 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.379
 so you get a good boost again 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.909
 they can now be properly prepared 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.860
 for the rest of the season so we 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.319
