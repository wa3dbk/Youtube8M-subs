00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
like I would just be erasing and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.950 
like I would just be erasing and
blotting<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.850> would<00:01:09.939> just<00:01:10.090> be<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> big<00:01:10.509> mess

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
to do that definitely it is less

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.240 
to do that definitely it is less
challenging<00:01:16.869> if<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.439> first<00:01:17.770> trace<00:01:18.100> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
challenging if you first trace the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.160 
challenging if you first trace the
structure<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:18.880> your<00:01:19.000> design<00:01:19.299> with<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.930> light

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
colored pencil and then just go over it

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.149 
colored pencil and then just go over it
with<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.090> liquid<00:01:22.299> liner<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.500> what<00:01:23.650> I<00:01:23.680> did<00:01:23.920> first

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
with a liquid liner so what I did first

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.359 
with a liquid liner so what I did first
was<00:01:24.400> I<00:01:24.939> did<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.299> upper<00:01:25.659> lash<00:01:26.049> line<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
was I did the upper lash line and the

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.700 
was I did the upper lash line and the
lower<00:01:27.579> lash<00:01:27.909> line<00:01:28.079> extended<00:01:29.079> both<00:01:29.380> on<00:01:29.619> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
lower lash line extended both on the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.100 
lower lash line extended both on the
inside<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.159> on<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.700> outside<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:31.570> then<00:01:32.079> I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
inside and on the outside and then I

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.469 
inside and on the outside and then I
connected<00:01:32.950> them<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.430> then<00:01:33.939> I<00:01:33.970> did<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> line

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
connected them and then I did a line

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.139 
connected them and then I did a line
throughout<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> entire<00:01:35.320> crease<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:36.130> line<00:01:36.759> over

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
throughout the entire crease a line over

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
throughout the entire crease a line over
the<00:01:37.270> brow<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.380> line<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.740> connect<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.130> brow

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
the brow and a line to connect the brow

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.490 
the brow and a line to connect the brow
to<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> bottom<00:01:40.210> tip<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.780> then<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.259> just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
to the bottom tip and then I just

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.740 
to the bottom tip and then I just
started<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:41.950> couple<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.520> wings<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.180> then<00:01:43.720> I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
started do a couple of wings and then I

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.050 
started do a couple of wings and then I
connected<00:01:44.470> them<00:01:44.649> you<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.399> always<00:01:45.670> go<00:01:46.030> back

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and add more of the black line but once

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.429 
and add more of the black line but once
you<00:01:48.969> put<00:01:49.119> on<00:01:49.180> too<00:01:49.479> much<00:01:49.659> it's<00:01:49.869> hard<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.259> take

away<00:01:50.770> after<00:01:51.579> I<00:01:51.610> do<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> black<00:01:52.000> lines<00:01:52.329> I<00:01:52.659> did

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
away after I do the black lines I did

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.219 
away after I do the black lines I did

really<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.320> distill<00:01:59.829> it<00:02:00.070> because<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.460> feel

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
really like to distill it because I feel

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120
