replacing<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.660> panel<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.830> need<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> drill

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
replacing this panel we need to drill

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.209 
replacing this panel we need to drill
out<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.140> rivets<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
out the rivets that are right in this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
out the rivets that are right in this
area<00:00:33.770> yeah

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.690

don't know it's just ready to pop out
your<00:00:52.330> hammer<00:01:00.180> let's<00:01:01.180> see<00:01:01.390> I'm<00:01:01.510> assuming

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
your hammer let's see I'm assuming

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.720 
your hammer let's see I'm assuming
there's<00:01:02.080> probably<00:01:02.350> no<00:01:02.470> rivets<00:01:02.800> here<00:01:03.160> that's

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
there's probably no rivets here that's

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.280 
there's probably no rivets here that's
cross<00:01:04.720> really<00:01:04.990> huh<00:01:08.640> okay<00:01:09.810> let<00:01:10.810> me<00:01:10.870> just<00:01:10.930> crank

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
cross really huh okay let me just crank

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:24.760 
cross really huh okay let me just crank
that<00:01:11.440> real<00:01:11.680> quick<00:01:11.920> here

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.910 

yeah

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:55.240 

there<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.039> go<00:01:31.630> okay<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:54.649> caught<00:01:54.859> that<00:01:55.069> off

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
there we go okay so we caught that off

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.300 
there we go okay so we caught that off
and<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.689> what<00:01:56.869> we<00:01:56.990> did<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.229> because<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.130> a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
and then what we did is because it's a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.309 
and then what we did is because it's a
that's<00:01:58.549> a<00:01:58.700> vertical<00:01:59.000> diamond<00:01:59.959> in<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:00.170> meaning

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
that's a vertical diamond in it meaning

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.520 
that's a vertical diamond in it meaning
this<00:02:00.950> lower<00:02:01.310> beam<00:02:01.670> is<00:02:01.939> over<00:02:02.569> it<00:02:02.780> got<00:02:02.959> hit<00:02:03.170> here

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
this lower beam is over it got hit here

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440 
this lower beam is over it got hit here
this<00:02:04.039> upper<00:02:04.220> being<00:02:04.520> stayed<00:02:04.789> where<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.179> this

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
this upper being stayed where it is this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.270 
this upper being stayed where it is this
went<00:02:05.689> over<00:02:05.869> about<00:02:05.899> six<00:02:06.289> inches<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.950> have<00:02:07.130> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
went over about six inches we have to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.249 
went over about six inches we have to
pull<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.759> over<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.539> hold<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.079> one

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
pull this over that hold this in one

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.319 
pull this over that hold this in one
place<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:10.190> couldn't<00:02:10.549> do<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.789> with<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.090> plate

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
place we couldn't do that with the plate

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.479 
place we couldn't do that with the plate
here<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.810> we<00:02:12.200> were<00:02:12.290> doing<00:02:12.440> an<00:02:12.650> exercise<00:02:13.129> just

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
here and we were doing an exercise just

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.490 
here and we were doing an exercise just
to<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.849> what<00:02:14.000> would<00:02:14.090> happen<00:02:14.299> there's<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.079> kink

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to see what would happen there's a kink

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.319 
to see what would happen there's a kink
in<00:02:15.739> one<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.160> rear<00:02:16.400> cross<00:02:16.730> members<00:02:17.150> that

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
in one of the rear cross members that

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.839 
in one of the rear cross members that
holds<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.629> engine<00:02:17.810> mount<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.319> that<00:02:18.379> kink<00:02:19.310> it

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
holds the engine mount and that kink it

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.369 
holds the engine mount and that kink it
had<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.239> heated<00:02:20.540> up<00:02:20.599> with<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.810> heat<00:02:20.989> gun<00:02:21.019> so

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
had to be heated up with the heat gun so

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.229 
had to be heated up with the heat gun so
we<00:02:21.500> could<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:22.040> softer<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.640> we<00:02:22.730> could<00:02:22.849> actually

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
we could get softer so we could actually

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.270 
we could get softer so we could actually
hammer<00:02:24.049> it<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:24.620> Oliver

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
hammer it out so Oliver

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.640 
hammer it out so Oliver
we<00:02:25.849> were<00:02:25.970> very<00:02:26.269> successful<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:26.989> we<00:02:27.500> were

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
we were very successful at that we were

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.680 
we were very successful at that we were
able<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.010> grab<00:02:28.190> onto<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.610> brace<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:29.510> and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
able to grab onto this brace it up and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:48.449 
able to grab onto this brace it up and
we<00:02:29.840> pulled<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> over<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.560> squared<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.010> door

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.610 

it's<00:02:49.030> coming<00:02:49.329> isn't<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.629> yeah<00:02:49.900> when<00:02:50.470> we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
it's coming isn't it yeah when we

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
it's coming isn't it yeah when we
release<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.920> pressure<00:02:51.250> walked<00:02:51.670> over<00:02:51.879> a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
release the pressure walked over a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.789 
release the pressure walked over a
little<00:02:52.120> bit<00:02:52.269> not<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:52.510> much<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:53.769> we

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
little bit not that much so we now we

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.649 
little bit not that much so we now we
really<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.549> where<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.849> are<00:02:54.879> as<00:02:55.150> far<00:02:55.180> as<00:02:55.390> what

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
really know where we are as far as what

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.360 
really know where we are as far as what
the<00:02:55.810> polling<00:02:56.140> we<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.409> to<00:02:56.530> do<00:02:56.680> before<00:02:57.340> we

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the polling we have to do before we

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.509 
the polling we have to do before we
finish<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.819> trimming<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.299> great<00:02:59.200> day<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.980> lot
