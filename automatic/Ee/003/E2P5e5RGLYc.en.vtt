00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello here isabelle of the ecolo butterfly 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will take you on a tour 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.960
 birth of classes for the year 2013-2014 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 so we kept the system of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.139
 pockets that we would have many more 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.179
 years it works very well each 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.910
 cover has its material 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 then the kids what also needs 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.980
 simply take the material that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.390
 inside and then work on this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.000
 that they need to see during the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.930
 week and it works great 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 newly in the classroom the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 world map we're going to have a little 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.430
 geography course that adds this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.180
 year so it was really essential 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 to have one 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.440

 work with our library 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 the evo thread of the year i did a lot 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.920

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.110
 more organized we kept the same 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.270
 offices because it works very 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.580
 good for ocean and antonin with view to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.490

 languages ​​with grammar dictionaries 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.250

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.370
 then the storage system for 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.660
 organize me over the years so any 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.850
 the material that I find interesting 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.400
 stuff that I find online or that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.810
 works that me offered to me by 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.120
 friends but then that moment I can 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 simply the classes and then 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.470
 over time we can look 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.070
 what is hiding in his 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.940
 classes in support that can inspire me 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.470
 gold especially when I do the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.810
 curriculum or during the year it's 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.170
 really a moment we were in 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.630
 Inspiration failure and the laminator 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.850
 really it's almost for us it's 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.750
 almost a word what is called the front 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.150
 but it's really worth it 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.750
 to invest in a laminator our 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.420
 Whiteboard 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.310
 our schedule is what that is what 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.290
 go around the classroom for
