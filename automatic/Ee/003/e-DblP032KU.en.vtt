00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
doing microwave foods cuz they're all

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.609 
doing microwave foods cuz they're all
filled<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.549> sodium<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> crap<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.930> who

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
filled with sodium and crap that who

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.179 
filled with sodium and crap that who
knows<00:01:52.829> what's<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.189> then

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
knows what's in there right and then

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.760 
knows what's in there right and then
you're<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.390> also<00:01:57.509> 17<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you're also but you're also 17 so you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.639 
you're also but you're also 17 so you
probably<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> very<00:01:59.700> well<00:02:00.649> higher

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
probably have a very well higher

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.310 
probably have a very well higher
metabolism<00:02:02.119> then<00:02:03.119> obviously<00:02:03.600> someone<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.170> my

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
metabolism then obviously someone at my
