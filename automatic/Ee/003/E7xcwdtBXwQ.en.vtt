those<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.469> few<00:01:49.770> rounds<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.280> establish<00:01:50.880> he's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
those first few rounds he establish he's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.059 
those first few rounds he establish he's
not<00:01:51.600> doing<00:01:51.840> anything<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.200> he's<00:01:52.319> establishing

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
not doing anything but he's establishing

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.459 
not doing anything but he's establishing
that<00:01:53.219> he<00:01:53.609> sort<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:53.850> hypnotizes<00:01:54.569> his<00:01:54.990> opponent

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.379 
that he sort of hypnotizes his opponent

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:57.389 
and then he locks in his own what I call

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.779 
and then he locks in his own what I call
GPS<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.499> then<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> guys<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.609> big

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.879 
GPS and then it's then the guys in big
trouble<00:01:59.999> but<00:02:00.509> before<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.229> talk<00:02:01.409> about<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
trouble but before we we talk about that

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:02.660 
trouble but before we we talk about that
part<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
part of it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.169 
part of it
what<00:02:02.999> can<00:02:03.450> Manny<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.139> what<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.679> he<00:02:04.829> do

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
what can Manny do what should he do

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.879 
what can Manny do what should he do
early<00:02:06.179> on<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.600> fight<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.079> don't<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
early on in this fight I don't think you

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:09.830 
early on in this fight I don't think you
can<00:02:08.009> get<00:02:08.130> any<00:02:08.310> surprises<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:09.090> Manny<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.509> think

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
can get any surprises with Manny I think

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
can get any surprises with Manny I think
he<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.709> start<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> fight<00:02:11.190> fast<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.850> know

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
he has to start the fight fast you know

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
he has to start the fight fast you know
I<00:02:12.000> think<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.720> know<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I think you know the the the kind of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.320 
I think you know the the the kind of
common<00:02:14.190> perception<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.940> maining<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.209> be

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
common perception is for maining to be

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
common perception is for maining to be
effective<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> fight<00:02:16.050> he<00:02:16.470> has<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.740> try<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
effective in the fight he has to try to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.980 
effective in the fight he has to try to
be<00:02:17.190> very<00:02:17.400> busy<00:02:17.610> early<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:18.600> has<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.840> land

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
be very busy early on and he has to land

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.240 
be very busy early on and he has to land
something<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> get<00:02:19.560> before<00:02:19.710> his<00:02:19.890> attention

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
something to get before his attention

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.000 
something to get before his attention
early<00:02:20.460> on

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
early on

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.199 
early on
and<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.519> don't<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.879> can<00:02:21.939> get<00:02:22.030> any

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
and I don't think you can get any

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.490 
and I don't think you can get any
surprises<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.049> don't<00:02:23.290> think<00:02:23.409> you're

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
surprises with that I don't think you're

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.380 
surprises with that I don't think you're
gonna<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> mini<00:02:24.610> patio<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.090> comes<00:02:25.239> out

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
gonna see a mini patio that comes out

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.759 
gonna see a mini patio that comes out
and<00:02:25.510> being<00:02:25.689> patient<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.170> picking<00:02:26.439> his<00:02:26.530> spots

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
and being patient and picking his spots

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.520 
and being patient and picking his spots
because<00:02:27.069> ultimately<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.840> more<00:02:29.079> time<00:02:29.349> you

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
because ultimately the more time you

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.720 
because ultimately the more time you
give<00:02:29.709> Floyd<00:02:29.950> Mayweather<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.459> more<00:02:30.610> he's

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
give Floyd Mayweather the more he's

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.130 
give Floyd Mayweather the more he's
gonna<00:02:30.790> dominate<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.689> if<00:02:31.810> that's<00:02:31.989> his

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
gonna dominate you because if that's his

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.839 
gonna dominate you because if that's his
fight<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.680> he's<00:02:32.799> already<00:02:32.980> processing<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.730> as

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
fight and he's already processing you as

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.670 
fight and he's already processing you as
you're<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.090> along<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.510> line<00:02:34.629> so<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.140> think

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you're going along the line so I think

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.259 
you're going along the line so I think
it's<00:02:36.069> pretty<00:02:36.370> safe<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.610> say<00:02:36.879> that<00:02:36.909> Manny's

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
it's pretty safe to say that Manny's

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.580 
it's pretty safe to say that Manny's
gonna<00:02:37.329> try<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.629> start<00:02:37.840> fast<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.349> just<00:02:38.500> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
gonna try to start fast it's just a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.380 
gonna try to start fast it's just a
matter<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.400> effective<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.060> fast

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
matter of can you be effective that fast

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.899 
matter of can you be effective that fast
you<00:02:40.569> know<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:41.220> before<00:02:42.220> throwing<00:02:42.579> almost

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
right off the jump or Mayweather it will

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.190 
right off the jump or Mayweather it will
change<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.329> angle<00:03:13.629> on<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> off<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.019> jump

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
change the angle on you off the jump

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.330 
change the angle on you off the jump
when<00:03:14.290> will<00:03:14.379> you<00:03:14.470> jump<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.859> he<00:03:14.950> may<00:03:15.069> make<00:03:15.220> you

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
when will you jump in he may make you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.740 
when will you jump in he may make you
miss<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.730> change<00:03:15.909> the<00:03:16.000> angle<00:03:16.090> spin<00:03:16.420> around<00:03:16.540> or

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
miss and change the angle spin around or

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.050 
miss and change the angle spin around or
whatnot<00:03:16.959> step<00:03:17.680> around<00:03:17.950> there<00:03:18.549> for<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:18.909> you've

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
whatnot step around there for now you've

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.339 
whatnot step around there for now you've
lost<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.420> range<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.780> follow<00:03:19.989> up<00:03:20.139> with<00:03:20.290> the

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
lost the range to follow up with the

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.809 
lost the range to follow up with the
rest<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> combination<00:03:21.129> so<00:03:21.280> there's

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
rest of the combination so there's

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.160 
rest of the combination so there's
things<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> do<00:03:22.389> to<00:03:22.420> control<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> range

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
things that you do to control the range

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.039 
things that you do to control the range
so<00:03:23.909> it's<00:03:24.909> all<00:03:25.090> fine<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.419> dandy<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:25.750> we're<00:03:25.930> not

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
so it's all fine and dandy but we're not

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.569 
so it's all fine and dandy but we're not
hitting<00:03:26.199> a<00:03:26.349> punching<00:03:26.709> bag<00:03:26.739> here<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.459> know<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
hitting a punching bag here you know you

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.860 
hitting a punching bag here you know you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
even eat the punching bag with as many

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.259 
even eat the punching bag with as many
combinations<00:03:29.169> you<00:03:29.590> want<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.730> bunch<00:03:31.000> of<00:03:31.150> bag

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
combinations you want this bunch of bag

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.490 
combinations you want this bunch of bag
will<00:03:31.419> not<00:03:31.540> control<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> range<00:03:32.079> on<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.349> you

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
will not control the range on you you

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.960 
will not control the range on you you
have<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.889> greens<00:03:33.129> control<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.549> want<00:03:33.760> a

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
have all the greens control you want a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
have all the greens control you want a
guy<00:03:34.569> like<00:03:34.599> Floyd<00:03:34.840> Mayweather<00:03:35.290> controls<00:03:35.709> range

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
guy like Floyd Mayweather controls range

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.640 
guy like Floyd Mayweather controls range
and<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:36.699> busy<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.720> many<00:03:37.900> wants<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:38.290> be<00:03:38.470> he's

and so as busy as many wants to be he's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.039 
and so as busy as many wants to be he's
gonna<00:03:38.709> have<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.919> try<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.129> find<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.639> way<00:03:39.790> to

gonna have to try to find a way to

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.629 
gonna have to try to find a way to
effectively<00:03:41.049> control<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.919> range<00:03:42.160> early<00:03:42.519> on

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
effectively control the range early on

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.150 
effectively control the range early on
this<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.569> control<00:03:43.930> as<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.199> said<00:03:44.410> everybody's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160

something<00:04:10.090> hard<00:04:10.359> early<00:04:10.690> on<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.959> fight<00:04:11.139> to

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
something hard early on in the fight to

something hard early on in the fight to
get<00:04:11.349> in<00:04:11.440> Floyd's<00:04:11.709> mine<00:04:11.919> maybe<00:04:12.220> make<00:04:12.609> Floyd

get in Floyd's mine maybe make Floyd

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.399 
get in Floyd's mine maybe make Floyd
loses<00:04:13.359> concentration<00:04:13.540> I'm<00:04:14.079> not<00:04:14.230> saying

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
loses concentration I'm not saying

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.349 
loses concentration I'm not saying
that's<00:04:14.590> necessarily<00:04:14.829> heard<00:04:15.310> Floyd<00:04:15.579> but<00:04:15.730> at

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
that's necessarily heard Floyd but at

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.539 
that's necessarily heard Floyd but at
least<00:04:16.539> you're<00:04:16.959> thinking<00:04:17.260> about<00:04:17.739> something

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
least you're thinking about something

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.039

thoughts in his mind it's possible that

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.310 
thoughts in his mind it's possible that
Manny<00:04:21.880> can<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.150> effective<00:04:22.539> but<00:04:22.690> those<00:04:23.169> are<00:04:23.289> the

Manny can be effective but those are the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.439 
Manny can be effective but those are the
things<00:04:23.409> he<00:04:23.530> has<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.889> do<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:25.000> don't<00:04:25.180> know

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.250 
that he has that creative mindset enough
to<00:04:27.099> do<00:04:27.250> them<00:04:27.479> more<00:04:28.479> someone<00:04:28.690> employed<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.139> can

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
to do them more someone employed you can

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.750 
to do them more someone employed you can
do<00:04:29.349> it<00:04:29.469> to<00:04:29.560> him<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.099> know<00:04:30.219> one<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.580> things

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
do it to him you know one of the things

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.219 
do it to him you know one of the things
I<00:04:30.909> think<00:04:30.969> that<00:04:31.150> could<00:04:31.419> be<00:04:31.539> effective<00:04:31.960> off<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
I think that could be effective off the

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.050 
I think that could be effective off the
southpaw<00:04:32.440> style<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.099> I've<00:04:33.159> watched<00:04:33.490> Manny<00:04:33.880> in

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
southpaw style and I've watched Manny in

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.159 
southpaw style and I've watched Manny in
the<00:04:34.180> gym<00:04:34.360> work<00:04:34.599> on

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
the gym work on

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.200 
the gym work on
is<00:04:35.320> step<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.889> right<00:04:36.039> throw<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.820> right

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
is step to the right throw the right

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.689 
is step to the right throw the right
hook<00:04:37.509> Floyd<00:04:38.080> has<00:04:38.320> that<00:04:38.560> left<00:04:38.919> hand<00:04:39.160> down<00:04:39.280> low

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
hook Floyd has that left hand down low

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.950 
hook Floyd has that left hand down low
and<00:04:39.850> he's<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> little<00:04:40.240> vulnerable

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
and he's a little vulnerable

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.420 
and he's a little vulnerable
over<00:04:41.259> here<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.710> think<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:41.949> could<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.220> an

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
over here you think that could be an

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.100 
over here you think that could be an
effective<00:04:42.669> punch<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:43.270> Manny<00:04:43.419> he's<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.960> thing

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
effective punch for Manny he's the thing

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.270 
effective punch for Manny he's the thing
you<00:04:44.229> thought<00:04:44.440> he<00:04:44.590> steps<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.009> right<00:04:45.190> you

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
you thought he steps to the right you

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.890 
you thought he steps to the right you
told<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> right<00:04:45.699> hook<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.539> what<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.780> right

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
told the right hook the what the right

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.060 
told the right hook the what the right
hand<00:04:47.110> they're<00:04:47.229> all<00:04:47.289> he<00:04:47.380> has<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.530> do<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.919> step

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
have to do look it's one step literally

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.189 
have to do look it's one step literally
or<00:05:00.789> he<00:05:01.120> can<00:05:01.240> just<00:05:01.389> circle<00:05:01.539> and<00:05:01.810> go<00:05:01.870> back<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.139> the

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
or he can just circle and go back to the

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.680 
or he can just circle and go back to the
middle<00:05:02.470> ring<00:05:02.620> well<00:05:03.400> here<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:04.030> guy<00:05:04.210> goes<00:05:04.389> here

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
middle ring well here this guy goes here

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.600 
middle ring well here this guy goes here
and<00:05:04.990> before<00:05:05.680> you've<00:05:05.770> know<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.039> you've<00:05:06.190> reset

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
and before you've know it you've reset

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.430 
and before you've know it you've reset
and<00:05:06.820> every<00:05:07.300> reset<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.690> think<00:05:07.960> favors<00:05:08.229> Floyd

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
and every reset I think favors Floyd

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960 
and every reset I think favors Floyd
because<00:05:08.740> now<00:05:08.830> many<00:05:09.070> has<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.340> find<00:05:09.580> this<00:05:09.759> it's

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
because now many has to find this it's

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.570 
because now many has to find this it's
all<00:05:10.060> over<00:05:10.300> again<00:05:10.389> so<00:05:11.020> yeah<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:11.979> seems<00:05:12.340> simple

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
all over again so yeah it seems simple

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.070 
all over again so yeah it seems simple
but<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.150> lot<00:05:13.270> more<00:05:13.419> complicated<00:05:13.720> than<00:05:13.960> it

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
but it's a lot more complicated than it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.510 
but it's a lot more complicated than it
is<00:05:14.229> and<00:05:14.440> plus<00:05:14.590> his<00:05:14.710> hat<00:05:14.860> it's<00:05:15.039> playing<00:05:15.280> chess

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
is and plus his hat it's playing chess

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400 
is and plus his hat it's playing chess
at<00:05:15.669> light<00:05:15.789> speed<00:05:15.820> in<00:05:16.210> this<00:05:16.449> case<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:17.139> Manny

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
at light speed in this case and Manny

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.439 
at light speed in this case and Manny
gets<00:05:18.250> hit<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> lot<00:05:18.520> with<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.030> straight<00:05:19.270> right

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
gets hit a lot with the straight right

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.260 
gets hit a lot with the straight right
hand<00:05:19.750> all<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.620> time<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.160> that's<00:05:21.520> Floyd's<00:05:21.940> a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
hand all the time and that's Floyd's a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.779 
hand all the time and that's Floyd's a
best<00:05:22.750> weapon<00:05:23.199> I'm<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.949> the<00:05:23.979> opinion<00:05:24.190> if<00:05:24.580> there

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
best weapon I'm of the opinion if there

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.300 
best weapon I'm of the opinion if there
was<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.060> stoppage<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:25.840> this<00:05:26.020> fight<00:05:26.289> I'm<00:05:26.560> against

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
was a stoppage in this fight I'm against

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.490 
was a stoppage in this fight I'm against
conventional<00:05:28.270> wisdom<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.750> think<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.110> stoppage

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
conventional wisdom I think the stoppage

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.070 
conventional wisdom I think the stoppage
would<00:05:29.680> would<00:05:29.919> favor<00:05:30.130> Mayweather<00:05:30.699> yeah<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.300> can

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
would would favor Mayweather yeah I can

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.689 
would would favor Mayweather yeah I can
see<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.259> happening<00:05:32.470> because<00:05:32.860> over

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
see that happening because over

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:34.950

think of a stoppage and they think of

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.740
