00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello with you i stas karabash and today u 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.720
 us guests 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.189
 car mitsubishi oh sex 2013 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.679
 with a two-liter engine and box 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 CVT wheel drive in this car 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.559
 showed himself decent enough yesterday 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.509
 scrambled up 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 this is this particular machine on 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.970
 quite steep snowy hill 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 and winning quietly itself without straining and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.330
 without help 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 where I would like to start a story about 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.900
 car about it with what it is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 mitsubishi full save noise isolation 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.590
 and anti-corrosion materials 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 that is, when buying such a car, I 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.180
 would recommend immediately making it full 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 anticorrosive here is obesshumka 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 this thing is here already to taste it 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 there is someone as convenient for someone 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 annoying noise made by the motor and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 variator someone not here manticore 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.780
 would be necessary because metal 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.610
 sometimes just naked given car 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 this is a car of a thousand and thirteenth year 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.100
 this is a restayl that is already modified 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.079
 version 1 1 car childhood diseases 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 already treated there is a compressor 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 conditioners that they originally 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.960
 was quite a sore spot steering 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.570
 management the Japanese promise that they 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.250
 flew she won't 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 give any surprises especially by 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.770
 cold road the Japanese claim that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.830
 the suspension has become more energy intensive and more 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.450
 soft well and in general supposedly a car 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.280
 they improved the car is equipped 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.630
 the two-liter engine is the same 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.640
 the motor that is already installed 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.490
 familiar lancer 10 generation 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.990
 two-liter 4b 11 atmospheric engine 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.410
 147 chain drive and 198 newtons 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.470
 torque paired with it works 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.720
 6 speed variator that supposedly here 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.850
 The new version of Ristyle is updated and 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.250
 must not hang on the gears 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.869
 but unfortunately he does the same thing 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 and the previous version that is, it hangs 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.580
 in high gears and as for me 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 so he remained unchanged 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.830
 since the last version of the car 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.960
 equipped with bi-xenon headlights with 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.910
 linsed optics and after i 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.560
 drove by car on this car about 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.440
 5000 kilometers I think the light turned out 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.940
 very indecent car to 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 Unfortunately, it is equipped with only three 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.140
 motors 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.070
 1 6 liters 1 8 liters and 20 liters and why 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.660
 engineers 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.370
 guided by the equipment exactly 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.170
 such motors are not entirely clear because 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 what's the engine compartment here 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.549
 quite spacious and quite allows 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.940
 installation of a larger motor and 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.870
 oversized gearbox 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.799
 car stand out class compact 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.140
 crossovers 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.640
 so a place in the cabin especially for 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.060
 rear passengers quite limited 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.060
 landing rear passengers in my opinion 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.650
 not very comfortable for landing front 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.989
 space enough but passengers 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.200
 seat cushion a bit short on long 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.970
 distance if the leg rises 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.519
 the trunk of the car is modest enough 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.900
 it is not small and at the same time all the back 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.670
 the seat fold up for some reason not 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.810
 level with the floor and as flat floor in 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.660
 this car will not make us 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.170
 the back seat folds back in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.340
 In general, it turns out virtual deception 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.959
 because 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.790
 trunk volume they are very strong 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.319
 conceal why need a flat floor 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.879
 car in the trunk to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.370
 could load such a dimensional 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.680
 objectivity box large some 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.530
 refrigerator washing washing 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.690
 typewriter stove and seemingly like you have 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.190
 here's a big trunk and she's not 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.500
 goes about capacity you can't 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.840
 put there something very big on 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.549
 whom this car is intended for 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.860
 car home people oriented 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.700
 who need a little more space than in 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.250
 usually want becky 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.470
 in order to move generally in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.239
 within the city â€‹â€‹probably 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.530
 carry a little more cargo than again 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.380
 also in the same small though Becky 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.209
 small and conditionally impassable 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.349
 places get a little more clearance and 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.349
 more terrain
