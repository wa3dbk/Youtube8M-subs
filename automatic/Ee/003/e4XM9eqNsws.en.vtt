00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.950
 or less how many times a week the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 consume good I consume three times a 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.519
 the week is the non-consumption during a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.709
 week but always consumption 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.200
 constantly once every three weeks 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.840
 and if I do that week I do not return it to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.730
 do once but not every week 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 because it does not seem good either 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.800

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.920
 junk food makes you sick to your health 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.580
 Yes, I think it hurts me 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 enough and I know that some time I will 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.890
 generate health problems but I 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.170
 I love it, obviously I do not know that it is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.730
 super mario has a lot of oil 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.090
 fat and that will cause me not to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.920
 press high in some future but good 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.260
 I rarely do not think so 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.410
 that is so bad does not do me good anymore 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.800
 that I can repression high or I can 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.350
 be bad 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.690
 excessive consumption of products such as 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.030
 chocolate sweets and all kinds of food 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.910
 fast until the young people express 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.550
 greater emotional instability and changes 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.550
