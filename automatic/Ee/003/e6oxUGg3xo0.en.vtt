00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
stand out about the original one thing I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.400 
stand out about the original one thing I
notice<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> stands<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.750> about<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> Space

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
notice it stands out about the Space

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
notice it stands out about the Space
Princess<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.130> course<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.750> curvature

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
Princess of course is a little curvature

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.869 
Princess of course is a little curvature
little<00:00:38.430> lines<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.120> clouds<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.719> star

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
little lines and the clouds and the star

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.040 
little lines and the clouds and the star
so<00:00:41.879> um

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
so um

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.310 
so um
secondly<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> find<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.450> base<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
secondly we have to find a base to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
secondly we have to find a base to
create<00:00:46.710> something<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.600> done

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
create something and when I get done

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
create something and when I get done
with<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.520> nobody<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.940> able<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
with this nobody is going to be able to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.030 
with this nobody is going to be able to
tell<00:00:51.329> which<00:00:51.510> ones<00:00:51.809> which<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.769> put<00:00:52.920> them

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
tell which ones which I can put them

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.170 
tell which ones which I can put them
side<00:00:53.250> by<00:00:53.280> side<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> no<00:00:56.760> idea

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
side by side and you will have no idea

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.569 
side by side and you will have no idea
which<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.260> we'll<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> test<00:00:59.370> at

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
which one is which so we'll do a test at

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.420 
which one is which so we'll do a test at
the<00:00:59.730> end<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> figure<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.320> out

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the end to see if we can figure it out

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.140 
the end to see if we can figure it out
all<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.790> start<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.600> our<00:01:04.220> base<00:01:05.220> which

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
all right now start with our base which

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.180 
all right now start with our base which
by<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> people<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.070> gonna

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
by the way and a lot of people are gonna

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.980 
by the way and a lot of people are gonna
be<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.310> oh<00:01:08.640> what's<00:01:08.940> that<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.540> tattoo

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
be like oh what's that it's my tattoo

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.859 
be like oh what's that it's my tattoo
it's<00:01:10.740> coming<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.250> though<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.479> here's<00:01:12.720> our

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's coming off though so here's our

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.370 
it's coming off though so here's our
base<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.610> they<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.000> sheet<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.539> shiny<00:01:15.990> foil

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
base and they take a sheet of shiny foil

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.290 
base and they take a sheet of shiny foil
stars<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:18.149> then<00:01:19.130> we<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> stars

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
stars and then we take one of the stars

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.469 
stars and then we take one of the stars
and<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.899> put<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.410> her<00:01:22.649> head<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:26.479> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and we put it on her head and now it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
and we put it on her head and now it
doesn't<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:27.869> quite<00:01:28.080> right<00:01:28.200> let's<00:01:28.649> let's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
doesn't look quite right let's let's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.090 
doesn't look quite right let's let's
readjust<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.179> make<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:31.100> accurate

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
readjust it to make it more accurate

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.840 
readjust it to make it more accurate
here<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.649> so<00:01:34.649> now<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.520> space

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
here we go so now we have a space

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.779 
here we go so now we have a space
princess<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.190> take<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.580> one

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
princess and I'm going to take this one

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.300 
princess and I'm going to take this one
away<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.300> moment<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.800> I'm<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.159> put

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
away for a moment and I'm going to put

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.120 
away for a moment and I'm going to put
them<00:01:41.460> both<00:01:41.640> together<00:01:42.229> and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
them both together and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.490 
them both together and
seeking<00:01:46.119> figure<00:01:46.420> out<00:01:46.509> which<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:46.780> which

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.410 

and<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:52.270> know<00:01:52.450> which<00:01:52.630> ones<00:01:52.900> which<00:01:54.420> okay

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
and you know which ones which okay

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.960 
and you know which ones which okay
because<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:56.140> kind<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.680> tried<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.920> pull<00:01:57.670> fast

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
because I kind of tried to pull fast

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.460 
because I kind of tried to pull fast
when<00:01:58.270> there<00:01:58.420> i<00:01:58.450> put<00:01:58.510> this<00:01:58.780> one<00:01:58.990> down<00:01:59.020> first

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
when there i put this one down first

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.080 
when there i put this one down first
assuming<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:00.430> would<00:02:00.550> think<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.790> was

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
assuming that you would think that was

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.020 
assuming that you would think that was
the<00:02:01.120> original<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.920> it's<00:02:03.100> not<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.910> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the original but it's not this is the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.670 
the original but it's not this is the
one<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.270> mean<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.780> this<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.380> 1i<00:02:05.590> bought
