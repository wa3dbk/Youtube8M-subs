00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 two 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 one 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.799
 uu 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.710
 the human being has always tried to impose his ideas on others 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 of all the forms used to achieve it the word proved to be the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.210
 more effective 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.199
 with the arrival of mass communication the word was gone 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.140
 incorporating sound and image thus developing 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.140
 what we know as the persuasive message 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.750
 to make this kind of our variety spaces 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 we will see in what way 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.760
 a perception is the use of free to devote time 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.720
 to my family 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.480
 by frame reinforce other people's attitudes 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.769
 within this process 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.710
 the role of the emitter must conform to certain characteristics to be able to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.020
 transmit the message your effective way 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 to as many people as possible 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.620
 credibility is one of these 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.180
 thanks to her the receiver will more easily believe what it means 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.890
 this feature is for example the news especially printed 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.340
 almost everyone is willing to believe what the newspapers say about 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.740
 all if they defend ideas similar to those of the receiver 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.690
 the sense of honesty that transmits the source will also allow a 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.310
 most effective perception 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.630
 TV is disinterested in the message we will be willing to follow 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.330
 that is true 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.380
 authority is another of the characteristics that are used to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.560
 impose rationing in an unquestionable way for the receiver 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.320
 throughout history the established religious political power as 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 military has decided that it is the right thing in a society 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.360
 and finally the attractiveness in a society in which the image is what 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.020
 sells the first impression is crucial 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.069
 in this asset 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.299
 either of an object another person who transmits the message is a very 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.299
 important when it comes to capturing the attention of the enclosure 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.949
 all these united factors allow a huge persuasive power however 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.879
 must be imposed properly to achieve the desired effect 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.189
 you can step on each other 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.819
 if one of them exerts its opposite effect, nothing else 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.279
 body 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.589
 the forward tells what they are talking about with eta 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.619
 the president fini denies proposes for the long summer 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.149
 I still do not 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.249
 the second element in the process of persuasion is the message of it depends 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.249
 how it will take the audience and the effect it will cause 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.369
 which is the easiest way to persecute people 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.309
 One of the most common and effective ways is to appeal to emotion 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.879
 is to associate a certain object with something nice so that 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.209
 then that subjects are capable by themselves and evoke those same feelings 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.390
 is what is known as the classic conditioning 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.670
 in advertising this strategy is often used children few hours 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.290
 that we wake up feelings of tenderness nice music people 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.470
 attractive sensual images fields landscapes 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.269
 but not only can you appeal to positive emotions the fear played 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.149
 an important role in some campaigns for this Tuesday in social 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.149
 This is the case of campaigns for the prevention of traffic accidents 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.249
 in general the greater the fear evoked mayer is the persuasive ability 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.709
 of the message as long as you take into account aspects such as showing 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.669
 dreaded consequences for example the drought suffered after an accident of 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.049
 traffic show how to avoid its consequences 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.829
 using the case for example 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.999
 and that the person to whom the message is directed is believed capable of carrying out 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:16.999
 the necessary actions to avoid such consequences 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.319
 The reasoning stated in the message is also decisive in influencing 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.360
 in the receiver 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.699
 consists in offering proven data and evidence 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.979
 a time of reflection to the receiver to assimilate the advantages and disadvantages of 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.150
 what we are offering based on the reasoning exposed the message 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.800
 it can be unilateral if it presents only the advantages of what we are 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.409
 pretending lateral ovi if it also presents the disadvantages or the position 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.289
 contrary to the defendant 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.930
 the latter tend to work better because they seem fairer and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.770
 balanced making the source more credible 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.960
 on the contrary they can push systematic thinkers to analyze the 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.440
 situation in more detail and to question the validity of the part 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.909
 contrary 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.719
 according to the order in which we present the argument we can also obtain 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.559
 advantage over messages opposed to ours 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.159
 If the two messages are presented in a row, the first one has the advantage over 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.139
 the second however if there is a pause between them the second usually has a 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.189
 greater impact 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:23.039
 but even if the sender is convincing and we send the message in a way that 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.549
 transmit in the best way nothing can be done if the receiver is not 

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:27.849
 convince
