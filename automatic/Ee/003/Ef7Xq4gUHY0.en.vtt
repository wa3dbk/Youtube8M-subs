00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.739
 to make a risotto is above all a cooking technique was it rice 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:13.409
 intel daury first is about Paris we do not have it waiting salivary and 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.039
 in the mountains so this is what will give it its creamy side in the end 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.509
 cooking I start paris and Lille in a thick-bottomed saucepan 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 he then adds a minced onion 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 I will follow without staining with a pinch of salt 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.780
 cf. 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 different types of grace with used to start August 8, 2008 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.999
 like here 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.019
 with butter the same as traditionally in Milan with the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.010
 fashion 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 I will wait for the creamery I play the audio 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.559
 and I'm going to stir and the show is doing 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.470
 for fat 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.620
 so that it becomes slightly translucent 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.470
 be careful of not especially for the others and at this moment of the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.680
 preparation when your country there are 38 seats we will be able to start add 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.489
 liquid 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.740
 we always start with a very big white or red 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.830
 we denote the pan and we will let the rice absorb safely 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.190
 when lorient absorb all this humility I will start to wet 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.100
 gradually with a team of water at the latest a broth of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.780
 poultry beef broth a broth of crustaceans broth 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 vegetables 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.650
 the fact that you wish 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 traditionally Italian boiling this time the risotto 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.780
 the little trick plan at least two and a half times the volume of water per 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.640
 ratio to the volume of rice 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.180
 on a constant stream so as to guarantee a slight evolution we are going 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.560
 cook the rice first have constantly so that the temperature 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 can regulate inside the pan 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.710
 I add water only from the moment the lorient has absorbed 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.790
 all the previous three smells 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.320
 lorient is not cooked until it has absorbed beyond which five 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 times its volume of water and that did not cook 15 minutes 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.830
 from the time 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.919
 or lorient 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.189
 in addition these two conditions 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.409
 we'll stop it as soon as it begins to take on a creamy consistency 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.689
 to finish binding the risotto we can add him 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.299
 a piece of butter to make it even more anxious 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.299
 Parmesan cheese that's also salty 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.389
 do not hesitate to perfume with dr spices 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.879
 the spices 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.920
 the risotto does not wait for it as soon as it is ready it must be served for the 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 to taste otherwise it hardens 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.060
 we can add a broth analysis before serving clearly 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.809
 enough kilos service 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.909
 and that he arrives at the right texture 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:47.949
 many guests 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.019
 for the hour the cars the technique of baking oven always has the same by 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.730
 against the ingredients the damaged 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.250
 depending on your desires
