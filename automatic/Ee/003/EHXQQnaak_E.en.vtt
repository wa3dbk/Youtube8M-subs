there's<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> few<00:00:51.480> supplies<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

need

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
need

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
need
I<00:00:52.800> used<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.579> season<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.149> style<00:00:54.590> Stampin<00:00:55.590> Up

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I used the season of style Stampin Up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
I used the season of style Stampin Up
designer<00:00:56.070> series<00:00:56.460> paper<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.870> all

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
designer series paper and it's all

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
designer series paper and it's all
double-sided<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.789> 12

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
double-sided so you would have 12

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.000 
double-sided so you would have 12
different<00:01:00.449> patterns<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
different patterns to work with and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
different patterns to work with and
that's<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> used<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.629> trees<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that's what I used on these trees and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's what I used on these trees and
you'll<00:01:05.220> probably<00:01:05.400> want<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> trimmer<00:01:06.270> because

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you'll probably want to trimmer because

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.969 
you'll probably want to trimmer because
you're<00:01:06.810> gonna<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> cut<00:01:07.500> these<00:01:07.650> into

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you're gonna need to cut these into

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
you're gonna need to cut these into
strips<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.350> need

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
strips and then you're going to need

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.910 
strips and then you're going to need
your<00:01:10.950> bone<00:01:11.159> folder<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.540> straight<00:01:12.869> pins

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
your bone folder and some straight pins

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
your bone folder and some straight pins
so<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.220> super<00:01:15.119> easy<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.020> few<00:01:16.320> supplies

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so it's super easy just a few supplies

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
so it's super easy just a few supplies
and<00:01:17.159> let<00:01:17.490> me<00:01:17.700> show<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> how<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and let me show you how to make that I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
and let me show you how to make that I
just<00:01:19.140> wanted<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> show<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.740> how<00:01:20.430> easy<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
just wanted to show you how easy this is
to<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.280> strips<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> paper<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to make all of the strips of paper that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.960 
to make all of the strips of paper that
you're<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.900> cut<00:01:25.110> our<00:01:25.350> half<00:01:25.710> inch<00:01:26.159> wide

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you're going to cut our half inch wide

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.039 
you're going to cut our half inch wide
and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.110> cut<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.650> different<00:01:29.130> lengths<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and I cut them different lengths for the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.819 
and I cut them different lengths for the
largest<00:01:31.470> tree<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.259> started<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> bottom

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
largest tree I started at the bottom

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.260 
largest tree I started at the bottom
with<00:01:35.790> half<00:01:36.390> inch<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:37.110> 12<00:01:37.530> inch<00:01:37.829> pieces<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
with half inch by 12 inch pieces and I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
with half inch by 12 inch pieces and I
actually<00:01:39.479> made<00:01:39.990> myself<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.920> charts<00:01:41.430> here

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
actually made myself little charts here

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
actually made myself little charts here
because<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> recreate<00:01:43.229> these<00:01:43.619> trees

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because I want to recreate these trees

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550 
because I want to recreate these trees
so<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.600> information<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> my

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
said I did start with larger pieces at

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
said I did start with larger pieces at
the<00:01:53.159> bottom<00:01:53.549> half<00:01:53.909> inch<00:01:54.210> by<00:01:54.450> 12<00:01:54.810> inch<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.229> the

on<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.799> tree<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.850> medium<00:02:03.329> tree<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
on this tree this is the medium tree and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.010 
on this tree this is the medium tree and
I've<00:02:04.710> started<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.520> half<00:02:05.880> inch<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:06.420> 7<00:02:06.930> inch

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I've started with half inch by 7 inch

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
I've started with half inch by 7 inch
pieces<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> bottom<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
pieces at the bottom and I'm going to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.660 
pieces at the bottom and I'm going to
move<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.860> half<00:02:11.340> inch<00:02:11.610> by<00:02:11.819> 6<00:02:12.209> inch

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
move up here to half inch by 6 inch

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.970 
move up here to half inch by 6 inch
pieces<00:02:13.030> up<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> top<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
pieces up at the top and it's just to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.490 
pieces up at the top and it's just to
keep<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.459> scale<00:02:15.849> going<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.599> little<00:02:17.050> bit<00:02:17.290> better

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
keep the scale going a little bit better

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.199 
keep the scale going a little bit better
so<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.920> they're<00:02:18.220> not<00:02:18.370> too<00:02:18.700> big<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.030> fluffy

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
so that they're not too big and fluffy

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.640 
so that they're not too big and fluffy
at<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.630> top<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.950> take<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.730> half<00:02:21.970> inch

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
at the top so you take your half inch

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.300 
at the top so you take your half inch
wide<00:02:23.650> piece<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:27.010> use<00:02:27.130> your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
wide piece and you can just use your

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.699 
wide piece and you can just use your
bone<00:02:27.459> folder<00:02:27.489> like<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.720> it's<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.350> like

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
bone folder like this it's just like

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890 
bone folder like this it's just like
your<00:02:29.890> curling<00:02:30.310> ribbon<00:02:30.489> so<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.540> all<00:02:31.720> you're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
your curling ribbon so that's all you're

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.140 
your curling ribbon so that's all you're
gonna<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.680> piece<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.790> take<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
gonna do to that piece then you take a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.199 
gonna do to that piece then you take a
straight<00:02:34.540> pin<00:02:35.010> push<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.190> right<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.760> center

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
straight pin push it right in the center

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.610 
straight pin push it right in the center
and<00:02:38.100> then<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.459> push<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.850> straight<00:02:39.880> in

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
and then you just push it straight in

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.680 
and then you just push it straight in
like<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.640> did<00:02:42.880> find<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:43.360> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.660> go

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
like that and I did find that if you go

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.059 
like that and I did find that if you go
straight<00:02:44.530> in

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
straight in

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.640 
straight in
it<00:02:45.519> goes<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.239> much<00:02:46.450> easier<00:02:46.959> than<00:02:47.140> trying<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
it goes in much easier than trying to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.789 
it goes in much easier than trying to
push<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.190> pin<00:02:48.370> at<00:02:48.550> an<00:02:48.700> angle<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
push the pin at an angle now when you

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.270 
push the pin at an angle now when you
put<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.250> piece<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:53.410> sure<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.860> can<00:02:54.040> see

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
put the piece in not sure if you can see

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.180 
put the piece in not sure if you can see
this<00:02:54.459> but<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.030> looks<00:02:55.269> like<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.630> kind<00:02:55.959> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
this but it looks like it's kind of

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.360 
this but it looks like it's kind of
uncurled

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
uncurled

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460 
uncurled
a<00:02:57.459> bit<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> found<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.840> after<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.319> get

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
a bit and so I found that after I get

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.699 
a bit and so I found that after I get
several<00:03:00.069> pieces<00:03:00.310> pushed<00:03:00.880> in<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:02.049> just<00:03:02.380> do

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
several pieces pushed in if I just do

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.340 
several pieces pushed in if I just do
this<00:03:03.239> they<00:03:04.239> kind<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.630> recur<00:03:05.170> l'

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
this they kind of recur l'

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.740 
this they kind of recur l'
it's<00:03:05.769> just<00:03:06.130> sort<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.430> magic<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.209> then<00:03:07.600> all<00:03:07.720> of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
it's just sort of magic and then all of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.900 
it's just sort of magic and then all of
a<00:03:07.840> sudden<00:03:07.870> they<00:03:08.260> look<00:03:08.290> really<00:03:08.980> great<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.640> just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
a sudden they look really great and just

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.509 
a sudden they look really great and just
nice<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.239> compact<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.140> curly<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.310> you'll

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
nice and compact and curly so you'll

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.610 
nice and compact and curly so you'll
just<00:03:12.549> keep<00:03:12.940> filling<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.230> way<00:03:14.380> up

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
just keep filling it up all the way up

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.319 
just keep filling it up all the way up
and<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.269> very<00:03:16.540> top<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:18.000> purchased<00:03:19.000> this

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
and at the very top I purchased this

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.770 
and at the very top I purchased this
package<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.190> snowflake<00:03:21.190> ornaments<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.269> I've

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
package of snowflake ornaments and I've

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.190 
package of snowflake ornaments and I've
got<00:03:23.079> one<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.890> top<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.489> each<00:03:24.880> tree<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.780> just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
got one at the top of each tree I just

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.560 
got one at the top of each tree I just
pushed<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.769> right<00:03:26.920> down<00:03:27.280> into<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.940> top<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
pushed it right down into the top of the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.630 
pushed it right down into the top of the
styrofoam<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.739> that's<00:03:29.920> going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.459> my

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
styrofoam so that's going to be my

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.449 
styrofoam so that's going to be my
topper<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.329> each<00:03:31.540> tree<00:03:31.959> they're<00:03:32.799> great<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
topper on each tree they're great and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.970 
topper on each tree they're great and
really<00:03:33.940> full<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.049> just<00:03:35.260> find<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.709> spot

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
really full and if you just find a spot

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.620 
really full and if you just find a spot
you<00:03:36.250> know<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.519> needs<00:03:36.700> an<00:03:36.850> extra<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.329> curl

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
you know that needs an extra little curl

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.140 
you know that needs an extra little curl
you<00:03:37.840> just<00:03:38.049> push<00:03:38.230> an<00:03:38.380> extra<00:03:38.709> one<00:03:38.859> in<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
you just push an extra one in the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.630 
you just push an extra one in the
straight<00:03:40.480> pins<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.079> used<00:03:41.500> are<00:03:41.890> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
straight pins that I used are this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.000 
straight pins that I used are this
package<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.390> just<00:03:43.720> looked<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.290> cheapest

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
package I just looked for the cheapest

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.509 
package I just looked for the cheapest
and<00:03:45.329> longest<00:03:46.329> pins<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.440> could<00:03:47.769> find<00:03:48.130> and

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and longest pins that I could find and

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.400 
and longest pins that I could find and
that's<00:03:48.820> what<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.120> used<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.720> think<00:03:49.750> these<00:03:50.140> were

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
that's what I used I think these were

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.099 
that's what I used I think these were
about<00:03:51.150> three<00:03:52.150> or<00:03:52.269> four<00:03:52.480> dollars<00:03:52.630> for<00:03:53.019> the

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
about three or four dollars for the

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.699 
about three or four dollars for the
package<00:03:53.530> there<00:03:54.310> are<00:03:54.489> 350<00:03:55.299> pieces<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:56.140> here<00:03:56.470> and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
package there are 350 pieces in here and

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.039 
package there are 350 pieces in here and
I<00:03:57.190> can<00:03:57.459> tell<00:03:57.700> by<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.000> time<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.329> finish<00:03:58.810> this

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
I can tell by the time I finish this

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.220 
I can tell by the time I finish this
medium<00:03:59.530> tree<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.160> will<00:04:00.790> have<00:04:01.000> used<00:04:01.299> about<00:04:01.810> one

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
medium tree I will have used about one

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.130 
medium tree I will have used about one
package<00:04:02.859> so<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.549> am<00:04:03.970> guessing<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.540> means<00:04:04.780> I

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
package so I am guessing that means I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.340 
package so I am guessing that means I
have<00:04:05.380> about<00:04:05.620> 350<00:04:06.370> curls<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.600> all<00:04:07.870> three

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
have about 350 curls out of all three

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.449 
have about 350 curls out of all three
trees<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:10.030> did<00:04:10.299> keep<00:04:10.630> track<00:04:11.079> just<00:04:11.980> in<00:04:12.250> the

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
trees and I did keep track just in the

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.920 
trees and I did keep track just in the
large<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.359> medium<00:04:13.389> tree<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.620> used<00:04:15.519> about

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
large and the medium tree I used about

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.319 
large and the medium tree I used about
3/4<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.410> full<00:04:17.709> package<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.910> designer
