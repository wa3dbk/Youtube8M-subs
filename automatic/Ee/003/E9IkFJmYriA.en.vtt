00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 meeting your requests should 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.699
 make a second video to approach 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.220
 some games that were left out of the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 previous video and deserve to be cited 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.789
 here on the channel 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439
 Let's continue talking a little more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 about games that have won new 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.090
 versions on the current platforms through 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.130
 of the mail or sequences 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.360
 I believe that this time the list is 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.610
 more complete 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 So let's start with the muse of games. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 who ventured into almost every 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.200
 possible platforms win dozens of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.570
 sequence over the years and appearing 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 comic novels in a series of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 animated short films in addition to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.600
 own movie for theaters 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 since 1996 the tomb raider series sold 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 more than 30 million units and there 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.059
 became one of the most important symbols 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.059
 of the gaming industry 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.780
 even going through several good 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.750
 sequences her reputation walked through 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.979
 down in 2003 already cost the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 dynamics made her reborn with splendor 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.360
 showing a new lara and counting the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 heroin story of the beginning the new 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.979
 tomb raider is a game that shows the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.649
 suffering and heroin growth in 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.500
 a clear open and hostile world goes through 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.360
 Dangers and Stunning Scenarios 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.220
 if you want to know the origin of this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 character make sure to play a new 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.000
 tomb Raider 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.179
 a lot of people commented I could not 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.920
 quit quoting him here too uncle 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.110
 The most famous 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.509
 comics and cartoons after 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 Your nephew, antonio, of course. 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.099
 one NES game based on your 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.649
 The gift of God has a 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.840
 remastered version and look at the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.880
 result the 8-bit game visuals 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 were three-dimensionality the dubbers 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.039
 including some of his own 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.260
 TV drawing in English returned to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.760
 give voice to the characters without mentioning 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.760
 soundtrack that received a treatment 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.799
 Special wordless face has neither the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.799
 that comment simply perfect 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:34.319
 it 's mattel toy 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.180
 mabel continuing the list for me 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.030
 best fighting game after mortal 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.549
 kombat and street fighter icó is undoubtedly 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.680
 the kilo sting and it was one of the games 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.909
 most expected classics to win a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.090
 new version 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.790
 That's because in this year's e3 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.160
 has announced its new version that will be 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.040
 thrown to xbox glory the game in 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.510
 truth is a repudiation and brings almost all 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 the characteristics of their first 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.190
 versions released for super nintendo and 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.590
 nintendo 64 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 so we can see the gameplay 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.950
 game is animal 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:18.900
 Even gave up buying this video 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:20.459
 cassette that they call xbox board and to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.829
 NES which has one more 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.620
 news a lot of people did not know more 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:30.030
 This is the worst command game ever released. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.060
 in 1987 and provides the character you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.310
 In one of his hands he has a claw 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.650
 where you can interact with the scenario 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.650
 to pass certain stages or use as the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.980
 in 2008 was released its remake of where 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.090
 commands the ironman for psn and xbox 360 and 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.579
 pcs 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.400
 the game retained the same screen site cro / n 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.159
 scenarios that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.739
 but everything with a 3d atmosphere 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.989
 besides an update on some weapons 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.989
 and songs a lot of game time 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.580
 other games also received limits 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.340
 urban or remastered versions and is 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.740
 It is worth quoting some of them as 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.600
 for example the classic gaiden ninja 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.150
 franchise created for the little 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.290
 received a very successful version 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.290
 for current platforms 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.820
 there is also the remake of the game block in low 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.310
 racing and second is produced 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.540
 by a fan of the franchise script people left 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.540
 very well done 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.700
 another example that e-mail produced by 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.800
 fan is the game this is classic freis 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.770
 super nintendo franchise that had its 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.120
 and mail banned by sega did not support the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.400
 game creation 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.320
 It's a shame because I'm kind of sorry. 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.320
 well done 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.320
 is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.880
 we also have the vânia text that 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.690
 his rebound in 2010 with lords of shadow 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.690
 the other so much success you did in 2013 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.000
 and even the classic mega-drive altered 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.550
 beast earn their re-reading for the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.550
 playstation 2 that despite having left 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.820
 a 2d platform for 3d did not lose the 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.620
 its originality and it was too late 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.530
 So that's it folks I hope they have 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.240
 liked the video and leave it in the comments 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.850
