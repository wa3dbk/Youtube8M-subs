 in today's video I 'll show you my 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.030
 more filters on my iphone lenses 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 5 sec 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.449
 so let's check it, I'll keep mine 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 carts here in that box 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.920
 so come on, the first campaign is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 this one was the first champion that the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 team 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 she was transparent now that color 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 I do not know why she ends up being 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.310
 The head that I use the most that she clicked 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 oni 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.190
 the second is this one is from the deep 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.650
 chanel is a redhead she ends up being 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 The hardest I have is not to take 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.670
 leavell I use her a lot to grow this 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.700
 how different 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.900
 she is the most malleable i have is well 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.510
 and it is a rose well the fourth east 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.020
 here transparent rose has a bunny 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.840
 on the front and the ears of lioz ae 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.840
 He is to be supported like this, but no 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
 How does he stay until he's gone? 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.619
 you understand, then you end up being a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.619
 more charm 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 there are those who play here watermelon that has a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.020
 glasses that I found a reasoning at 6 o 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 fact that she has an eyeglass, she is not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.670
 so malleable 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.670
 but she is perfect 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 the sixth and last one is that of ice cream 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.470
 I was crazy behind that cape and people 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.910
 When I found confess of screeching 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 of joy 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:00.710
 good is an ice cream has stirring eyes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.710
 looks and is very malleable and is an ice cream 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 good guys these were my 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 I do not have many strollers 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.730
 people are going to buy a few more the same 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.280
 I think I have it, I think it's super cool. 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.849
 I do not think I really wanted to, so it 's 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.760
 that 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.250
 good now let's have even in say it is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.380
 the fisheye lens is not the one here 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.959
 but I have to do it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.530
 super cool in the photos she comes with a 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.489
 Dock for the cell phone and she 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:36.360
 People say she screwed up to put the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.980
 another that is smaller then effect 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.209
 super cool too 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.299
 the only thing different is that it is smaller and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.180
 there are these two here they are golden 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.130
 looks and super combined with the phone and I 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.530
 I have my monopoly that I have already shown 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.040
 a video here on the company channel 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 He's pink here and people I use to him. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.510
 to take pictures, I think the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.110
 super cool effect 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.660
 it is enough will not give to 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.880

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 I know you will ask my 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.480
 campaigns were around 35 to 45 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 real 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.910
 my lenses were 25 reais both 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.989
 and the monopoly that you know was a 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.810
 juice that was only 15 reais without the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.790
 Finding the plateau then this is it personal 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.130
