00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
steam game or something I just already

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.330 
steam game or something I just already
have<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.870> kind<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.230> do<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> quick<00:02:55.130> little

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
have and just kind of do a quick little

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.810 
have and just kind of do a quick little
video<00:02:55.670> about<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.380> see<00:02:57.710> if<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.010> sticks<00:02:58.490> I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
video about it and see if it sticks I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.000 
video about it and see if it sticks I
guess<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.540> don't<00:03:00.110> know<00:03:00.260> what<00:03:00.470> I'll<00:03:00.590> start<00:03:00.860> doing

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
guess I don't know what I'll start doing

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.520 
guess I don't know what I'll start doing
this<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.090> kind<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.900> want<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.140> start<00:03:03.320> doing

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
this but I kind of want to start doing

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.910 
this but I kind of want to start doing
it<00:03:03.800> because<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.460> think<00:03:05.590> branching<00:03:06.590> out<00:03:06.680> is

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
it because I think branching out is

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.190 
it because I think branching out is
probably<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.790> smartest<00:03:08.330> thing<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.630> do<00:03:08.960> with

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
probably the smartest thing to do with

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.370 
probably the smartest thing to do with
YouTube<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:10.580> never<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.940> good<00:03:11.180> idea<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.900> stick

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
YouTube it's never a good idea to stick

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.040 
YouTube it's never a good idea to stick
to<00:03:12.650> one<00:03:13.100> specific<00:03:13.730> thing<00:03:14.180> because<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:14.870> that

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
to one specific thing because if that

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.730 
to one specific thing because if that
one<00:03:15.230> specific<00:03:15.830> thing<00:03:15.910> disappears<00:03:17.320> say<00:03:18.320> my

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
one specific thing disappears say my

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.350 
one specific thing disappears say my
craft<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:19.310> kind<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.670> goes<00:03:19.850> down<00:03:20.120> or

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
craft just kind of goes down or

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.450 
craft just kind of goes down or
something<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:20.930> they<00:03:21.410> stopped<00:03:21.710> updating<00:03:21.920> and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
something or they stopped updating and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.740 
something or they stopped updating and
it<00:03:22.520> gets<00:03:22.640> boring<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:25.240> think<00:03:26.240> you're<00:03:26.450> gonna<00:03:26.570> have

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
it gets boring I think you're gonna have

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.360 
it gets boring I think you're gonna have
a<00:03:26.810> lot<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.110> people<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.650> are<00:03:27.740> scrambling<00:03:28.280> to
