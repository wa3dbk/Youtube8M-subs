00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so my emai jure scale is next and as we

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.180 
so my emai jure scale is next and as we
said<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.449> lowest<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:04.110> we<00:00:04.259> can<00:00:04.410> do<00:00:04.529> not<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.950> one

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
said the lowest a we can do not this one

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.490 
said the lowest a we can do not this one
but<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:06.240> octave<00:00:06.569> lower<00:00:06.600> so<00:00:06.960> that's<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> open

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
but the octave lower so that's the open

and<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.880> new<00:00:18.090> sharp<00:00:18.840> will<00:00:19.020> come<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> 7th

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and the new sharp will come on the 7th

note<00:00:19.859> d<00:00:20.820> sharp<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.710> then<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.980> active<00:00:23.910> e<00:00:24.080> if<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
note d sharp and then I active e if you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
note d sharp and then I active e if you
don't<00:00:25.350> understand<00:00:25.800> why<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:27.060> back<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
don't understand why that is go back to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
don't understand why that is go back to
the<00:00:27.480> previous<00:00:27.800> lessons<00:00:28.800> start<00:00:29.070> right<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the previous lessons start right with a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.070 
the previous lessons start right with a
C<00:00:29.849> scale<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> understand<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> theory

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
C scale so you understand the theory

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.000 
C scale so you understand the theory
behind<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.560> e<00:00:31.740> F<00:00:32.640> sharp<00:00:32.850> G<00:00:33.480> sharp<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.910> B<00:00:37.010> C

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
behind this so e F sharp G sharp a B C

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
behind this so e F sharp G sharp a B C
sharp<00:00:38.480> d<00:00:39.480> sharp<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.440> E<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.420> four

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
sharp d sharp and E so we have four

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
sharp d sharp and E so we have four
sharps<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> key<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> E<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
sharps now in the key of E and this

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
sharps now in the key of E and this
becomes<00:00:45.780> easier<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.410> easier<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.160> understand

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
becomes easier and easier to understand

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
becomes easier and easier to understand
as<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.910> along<00:00:48.180> hopefully<00:00:48.450> even<00:00:48.840> though

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
as you get along hopefully even though

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
as you get along hopefully even though
there<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.739> sharps<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> remember<00:00:50.840> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
there are more sharps to remember the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
there are more sharps to remember the
way<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.789> try<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
way to do these is not to just try to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
way to do these is not to just try to
figure<00:00:55.079> out<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> pattern<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> say<00:00:56.190> oh<00:00:56.219> I've

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
figure out the pattern and say oh I've

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.500 
figure out the pattern and say oh I've
got<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.030> every<00:00:57.469> you<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.579> F<00:00:59.579> sharp<00:01:00.149> every

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
got to keep every you know F sharp every

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.160 
got to keep every you know F sharp every
G<00:01:00.690> sharp<00:01:00.899> every<00:01:01.410> C<00:01:01.890> sharp<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.049> way

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
G sharp every C sharp and so on the way

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
G sharp every C sharp and so on the way
to<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to think about it is actually the to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
to think about it is actually the to
memorize<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.720> scale<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.409> say<00:01:07.500> e<00:01:07.710> F

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
memorize the scale and just say e F

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.090 
memorize the scale and just say e F
sharp<00:01:08.159> G<00:01:08.460> sharp<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.000> B<00:01:09.270> C<00:01:09.780> sharp<00:01:09.810> d<00:01:10.200> sharp<00:01:10.229> E<00:01:10.619> me

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
sharp G sharp a B C sharp d sharp E me
assure<00:01:11.549> G<00:01:11.790> sharp<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.150> B<00:01:12.180> C<00:01:12.840> sharp<00:01:12.869> d<00:01:13.229> sharp<00:01:13.260> E<00:01:13.650> and

assure G sharp a B C sharp d sharp E and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
assure G sharp a B C sharp d sharp E and
then<00:01:14.549> hunt<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.270> find<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
then hunt around and find them so if I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:27.160 
then hunt around and find them so if I
say<00:01:16.170> e<00:01:16.909> G<00:01:17.909> sharp<00:01:18.210> F<00:01:19.020> sharp<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:22.250> g-sharp<00:01:23.630> be<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.830 

that's<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.880> way<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.030> think<00:01:37.210> about<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.660> if

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
that's the way to think about it and if

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.290 
that's the way to think about it and if
you<00:01:38.050> remember<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:39.490> down<00:01:39.610> from<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.150> note

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
you remember going down from a note

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.740 
you remember going down from a note
that's<00:01:41.070> called<00:01:42.070> E<00:01:42.220> flat<00:01:42.730> so<00:01:43.120> it's<00:01:43.240> not<00:01:43.330> only<00:01:43.390> d

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
that's called E flat so it's not only d

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.090 
that's called E flat so it's not only d
sharp<00:01:44.170> its<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:45.520> flat<00:01:45.910> as<00:01:46.120> well<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.860> will

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
sharp its be flat as well and that will

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.310 
sharp its be flat as well and that will
be<00:01:48.340> problematic<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.300> certain<00:01:49.960> pieces<00:01:50.140> of

for that as well not to mention the fact
we<00:01:57.369> also<00:01:57.610> have<00:01:58.110> songs<00:01:59.110> you'll<00:01:59.979> see<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> song

you you're in the key of C well you're
going<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.100> immediately<00:02:18.100> think<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> key<00:02:18.910> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
going to immediately think in the key of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.160 
going to immediately think in the key of
C<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.239> then<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.450> start<00:02:19.660> playing<00:02:19.780> through<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
C and then you start playing through the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.300 
C and then you start playing through the
music<00:02:22.470> you're<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> say<00:02:23.830> wow<00:02:24.070> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
music you're going to say wow that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.530 
music you're going to say wow that
doesn't<00:02:24.580> sound<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> key<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.150> C<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.420> me

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
doesn't sound like the key of C to me

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.050 
doesn't sound like the key of C to me
yes<00:02:26.290> because<00:02:26.650> every<00:02:26.950> key<00:02:27.190> has<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.520> relative

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
yes because every key has a relative

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.690 
yes because every key has a relative
minor<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.540> if<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.200> memorized<00:02:29.709> your<00:02:29.950> 165

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
minor and if you memorized your 165

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.110 
minor and if you memorized your 165
chord<00:02:30.970> progressions<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.760> relative

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
chord progressions you know the relative

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.510 
chord progressions you know the relative
minor<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> key<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.900> C<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.830> next<00:02:36.220> chord

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
minor for the key of C it's a next chord

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.410 
minor for the key of C it's a next chord
which<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.270> minor<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:38.440> means<00:02:38.770> our<00:02:39.420> relative

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
which is a minor that means our relative

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.380 
which is a minor that means our relative
minor<00:02:40.570> for<00:02:40.810> gene<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.709> e<00:02:42.040> minor<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.820> when<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> song

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
minor for gene is e minor so when a song

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.560 
minor for gene is e minor so when a song
is<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.720> key<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.930> g<00:02:44.200> one<00:02:44.500> sharp<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:46.000> also<00:02:46.330> be

progressions by rote and then you'll

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.140

theoretically<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.820> reason<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.480> because<00:03:20.510> we

theoretically the reason is because we

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.870 
theoretically the reason is because we

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
in an a so that's called my Aeolian mode

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.720 
in an a so that's called my Aeolian mode
we're<00:04:34.500> going<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.710> make<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.070> very<00:04:35.250> simple

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
we're going to make that very simple

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.040 
we're going to make that very simple
when<00:04:35.850> we<00:04:35.940> talk<00:04:36.150> about<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.540> with<00:04:36.660> our<00:04:36.810> mold

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
when we talk about it with our mold

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.500 
when we talk about it with our mold
exercises<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:38.250> that's<00:04:38.460> why<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.790> shares<00:04:39.300> the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
exercises but that's why it shares the

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.010 
exercises but that's why it shares the
key<00:04:39.690> signature<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.440> an<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.730> minor<00:04:41.810> which<00:04:42.810> has<00:04:42.990> a

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
key signature and an a minor which has a

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.750 
key signature and an a minor which has a
flatted<00:04:43.500> third<00:04:43.710> in<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.980> scale<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.460> that's

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
flatted third in the scale and that's

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.460 
flatted third in the scale and that's
what<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> minor<00:04:45.180> chord<00:04:45.480> does<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.080> we're<00:04:46.320> going

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
what a minor chord does and we're going

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.300 
what a minor chord does and we're going
to<00:04:46.500> talk<00:04:46.650> about<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.890> when<00:04:47.070> we<00:04:47.190> go<00:04:47.280> through

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
to talk about that when we go through

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.520 
to talk about that when we go through
our<00:04:47.550> chords<00:04:47.970> it's<00:04:48.690> going<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.020> make<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.260> lot<00:04:49.500> more

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
our chords it's going to make a lot more

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.730 
our chords it's going to make a lot more
sense<00:04:49.980> so<00:04:50.750> go<00:04:51.750> on<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.140> next<00:04:52.169> which<00:04:52.530> will<00:04:52.650> be

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
sense so go on to the next which will be

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.330 
sense so go on to the next which will be
the<00:04:52.860> fifth<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.370> which<00:04:53.760> will<00:04:53.910> be<00:04:54.030> e
