00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 

it's<00:00:12.540> interesting<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.990> think<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.469> terms

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it's interesting to think of it in terms

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's interesting to think of it in terms
of<00:00:13.769> sampling<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.059> greatest<00:00:15.450> part<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
of sampling because the greatest part of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
of sampling because the greatest part of
music<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.500> least<00:00:16.560> early<00:00:17.070> hip-hop<00:00:17.460> music<00:00:17.730> was

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
music at least early hip-hop music was

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.999 
music at least early hip-hop music was
the<00:00:18.119> idea<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> sample<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.740> figure

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
the idea of the sample but if you figure

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.560 
the idea of the sample but if you figure
in<00:00:20.099> a<00:00:20.160> way<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.430> dump<00:00:20.669> became<00:00:21.060> sampled

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
in a way that dump became sampled

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.179 
in a way that dump became sampled
because<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.500> even<00:00:22.710> an<00:00:22.800> interesting

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because it's even an interesting

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.650 
because it's even an interesting

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
position at making took on that show

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.630 
position at making took on that show
they<00:00:24.869> designed<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> shoe<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> colors

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
they designed the shoe but the colors

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
they designed the shoe but the colors
were<00:00:26.759> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> sampled<00:00:27.419> in<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.779> can

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
were kind of sampled in a way you can

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.570 
were kind of sampled in a way you can
argue<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:28.920> were<00:00:28.980> used<00:00:29.310> by<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
argue because they were used by the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849 
argue because they were used by the
college<00:00:30.119> teams<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.050> colors<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> shoes

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
college teams so the colors of the shoes

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.350 
college teams so the colors of the shoes
were<00:00:32.040> given<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.519> the<00:00:32.610> shoes<00:00:32.820> no<00:00:33.059> one's<00:00:33.239> out

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
were given to the shoes no one's out

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.790 
were given to the shoes no one's out

between<00:00:43.290> nineteen<00:00:43.829> college<00:00:44.100> basketball<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
between nineteen college basketball I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
between nineteen college basketball I
think<00:00:45.300> was<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> interesting<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.350> don't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
think was kind of interesting is I don't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
think was kind of interesting is I don't
think<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.710> ever<00:00:46.860> happened<00:00:46.980> before<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
think it's ever happened before it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
think it's ever happened before it
wasn't<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> bunch<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.510> designers<00:00:48.930> like

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
wasn't like a bunch of designers like

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
wasn't like a bunch of designers like
the<00:00:49.230> pan<00:00:49.410> tons<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> an

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the pan tons I think that's kind of an

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.229 
the pan tons I think that's kind of an
interesting<00:00:51.090> lost<00:00:51.660> error<00:00:52.699> my<00:00:53.699> favorite<00:00:54.090> drunk

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
interesting lost error my favorite drunk

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.000 
interesting lost error my favorite drunk
of<00:00:54.390> all-time<00:00:54.480> still<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> Michigan<00:00:55.500> 1<00:00:55.649> i've

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of all-time still in Michigan 1 i've

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.349 
of all-time still in Michigan 1 i've
never<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.550> thought<00:00:56.760> anything<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
never really thought anything that

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.420 
never really thought anything that
anyone's<00:00:57.719> done<00:00:57.899> has<00:00:58.649> been<00:00:58.680> any<00:00:59.039> better<00:00:59.250> than

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
anyone's done has been any better than

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
anyone's done has been any better than
the<00:00:59.550> first<00:00:59.670> day<00:00:59.940> i've<00:01:00.840> thought<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> haze<00:01:01.410> one

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the first day i've thought the haze one

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.930 
the first day i've thought the haze one
was<00:01:01.739> quite<00:01:01.829> good<00:01:01.949> i<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.280> features<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.879> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
was quite good i think features on a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
was quite good i think features on a
good<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.300> I've<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:03.960> left<00:01:04.229> his<00:01:04.410> juicy

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
good one I've actually left his juicy

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.109 
good one I've actually left his juicy
ones<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.610> were<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.759> bit<00:01:05.970> more

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
ones just because they were a bit more

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.139 
ones just because they were a bit more
minimal<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.850> blur

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
minimal I think this could it is a blur

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.120 
minimal I think this could it is a blur
all<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> them<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.440> there's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
all of them but you know there's there's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
all of them but you know there's there's
been<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.759> what's<00:01:12.060> interesting<00:01:12.149> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
been a lot I think what's interesting is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.120 
been a lot I think what's interesting is
out<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.590> drunks<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.039> become

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
out of all the drunks or they become

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
out of all the drunks or they become
like<00:01:14.399> a<00:01:14.490> canvas<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:15.750> almost<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> blend

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
like a canvas it's almost like a blend

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.929 
like a canvas it's almost like a blend
t-shirt<00:01:16.590> let<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> give<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> someone<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
t-shirt let you give it to someone and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.730 
t-shirt let you give it to someone and
they<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.360> their<00:01:18.509> thing<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.170> think<00:01:19.619> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
they do their thing to it I think it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.990 
they do their thing to it I think it's
kind<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> interesting<00:01:20.159> over<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.759> over<00:01:20.790> again

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
kind of interesting over and over again

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
kind of interesting over and over again
people<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.600> different<00:01:21.960> decisions<00:01:21.990> on
