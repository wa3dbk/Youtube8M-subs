 I have a delicious pop ran to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.190
 you that Christmas you share with all the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 family ingredients on screen you 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.350
 wants a liter of milk a cup and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.250
 half of sugar a slice of cinnamon 14 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.560
 egg yolks a cup of brandy and it's 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.080
 everything you need to do 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 I break that describes me very much in the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.759
 facebook page asking me this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.100
 recipe and it really is very easy here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 we have the milk the milk should be 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.770
 hot when it's hot 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 let's add cinnamon and cinnamon 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 is going to merge with the heat of the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.230
 milk then it is very important that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 here you leave it about five minutes 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.050
 five minutes cooking that merges 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.660
 and so leave all its flavor the cinnamon 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.480
 after this time has elapsed 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.839
 of the five minutes you are going to beat 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.429
 the egg yolks with the sugar 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.289
 here I have the 14 egg yolks that 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:17.850
 It is a good drink based on buds 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:21.000
 sugar egg and delicious brandy then 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.939
 we incorporate the sugar knows that also 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.400
 you can put condensed milk 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.830
 condensed is going excellent instead of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.030
 sugar or can you do half and half 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.450
 and also doing very well 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.970
 ready and already incorporates the yolk with the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 sugar to let you cool the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.330
 milk and cool it is warm 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.909
 then we are going to add it to the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 buds I will not add too much 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.060
 hot knows why because we are 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.069
 cook the yolks then we can 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.960
 temper what I am doing 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.850
 sightly adding little by little and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.330
 that the flames have become accustomed to the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 temperature then we can return them 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.519
 to the pan in the same way now 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.269
 we beat the milk fast quickly 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.700
 we incorporate and look here we are going to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.480
 return to fire and go 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.720
 that the yolk kind of how long 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 approximately 5 to 7 minutes and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.080
