controller it will be added on to the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
controller it will be added on to the
website<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> guys<00:01:21.299> won't<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.659> able<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> buy

everything else like that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109

but<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> guys<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.850> was

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
but as you guys can see you know it was

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.370 
but as you guys can see you know it was
kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> interesting<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.200> these

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
kind of interesting to do these

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
kind of interesting to do these
controllers<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.340> they<00:01:35.490> did<00:01:35.700> split<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
controllers because they did split the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.109 
controllers because they did split the
front<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> back<00:01:37.159> with<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
front in the back with this little I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.899 
front in the back with this little I
guess<00:01:39.780> where<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> handle<00:01:41.100> grip<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> where<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
guess where the handle grip is where the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.990 
guess where the handle grip is where the
nubs<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> give<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
nubs are to kind of give it you know I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260 
nubs are to kind of give it you know I
have<00:01:45.149> no<00:01:45.720> idea<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.409> did<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.399> um<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.939> mean

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
have no idea what they did but um I mean

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
have no idea what they did but um I mean
as<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> guys<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.799> good

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
as you guys can see it was a really good
