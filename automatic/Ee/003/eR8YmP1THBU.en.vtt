possibilities with with all of our mini
games

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.210 

so<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> process<00:01:35.200> that<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:35.590> usually<00:01:36.070> go

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
so the process that we usually go

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.710 
so the process that we usually go
through<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:36.520> pets<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.090> will<00:01:37.300> base<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.660> off

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
through to make pets is will base it off

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.970 
through to make pets is will base it off
the<00:01:37.870> show<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.200> we'll<00:01:38.380> think<00:01:38.590> about<00:01:38.710> what

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
the show and we'll think about what

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.670 
the show and we'll think about what
would<00:01:39.070> be<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.250> fun<00:01:39.520> pet<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.290> case<00:01:41.470> we

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
would be a fun pet so in this case we

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.900 
would be a fun pet so in this case we
thought<00:01:41.860> well<00:01:41.980> droids<00:01:42.250> would<00:01:42.400> be<00:01:42.460> really<00:01:42.610> fun

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
thought well droids would be really fun

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.000 
thought well droids would be really fun
so<00:01:43.240> we<00:01:43.570> concept<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.200> bunch<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.470> droids<00:01:44.740> and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
so we concept it a bunch of droids and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.280 
so we concept it a bunch of droids and
then<00:01:45.370> came<00:01:46.330> up<00:01:46.360> with<00:01:46.570> all<00:01:46.660> kinds<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:47.050> fun

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
then came up with all kinds of fun

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.130 
then came up with all kinds of fun
little<00:01:47.470> animations<00:01:48.130> interactions<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.150> ends

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
little animations interactions and ends

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.600 
little animations interactions and ends
up<00:01:50.230> with<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.500> great<00:01:50.680> set<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.100> pets<00:01:51.370> that<00:01:51.460> you
