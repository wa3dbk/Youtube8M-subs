I'm going to be using the firewire cable

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.840 
I'm going to be using the firewire cable
instead<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.490> USB<00:03:43.410> because<00:03:44.410> i<00:03:44.680> was<00:03:45.069> quite<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.700> bit

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
instead of USB because i was quite a bit

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.130 
instead of USB because i was quite a bit
faster<00:03:46.330> then<00:03:47.080> normal<00:03:47.890> USB<00:03:48.130> as<00:03:49.510> USB<00:03:49.959> is

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
faster then normal USB as USB is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.080 
faster then normal USB as USB is
