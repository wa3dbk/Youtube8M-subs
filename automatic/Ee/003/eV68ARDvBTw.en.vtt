00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
keeper and also move it along these

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.139 
keeper and also move it along these
slots<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.859> see<00:00:41.159> here<00:00:41.339> there's<00:00:41.519> three

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
slots you can see here there's three

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.939 
slots you can see here there's three
slots<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> allows<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.769> is

slots and what that allows you to do is

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.979 
slots and what that allows you to do is
a<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> thickness<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.659> your<00:00:45.839> laptop

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
a get to the thickness of your laptop

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
a get to the thickness of your laptop
here<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.850> also<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.569> cover<00:00:48.839> any<00:00:49.079> ports

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
here and be also not cover any ports

these are gripping around the edges of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.419 
these are gripping around the edges of
the<00:01:50.909> laptop<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:51.960> set<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.439> so

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
the laptop here how I've set it up so

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.069 
the laptop here how I've set it up so
I've<00:01:53.700> made<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> thicknesses<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.840> or

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
I've made the thicknesses on this or

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.039 
I've made the thicknesses on this or
equal<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> laptop<00:01:57.090> thickness<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.929> those

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
equal to the laptop thickness of those

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
equal to the laptop thickness of those
points<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.679> I've<00:01:59.369> position<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.359> can

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
points and I've position these so I can

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
points and I've position these so I can
get<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> other<00:02:00.869> ports<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:01.499> whatever<00:02:01.829> ports

there<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.270> have<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.510> I've<00:03:39.750> swapped<00:03:40.050> out<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
there we have it I've swapped out the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.500 
there we have it I've swapped out the
tray<00:03:40.650> now<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> have<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.640> one<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> flat

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
tray now I have the one with the flat

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.230 
tray now I have the one with the flat
side<00:03:42.900> keepers<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.490> let's<00:03:44.700> throw<00:03:44.940> our

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
side keepers on it so let's throw our

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.140 
side keepers on it so let's throw our
laptop<00:03:45.690> back<00:03:45.930> into<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.530> tray<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.730> goes<00:03:47.940> in

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
laptop back into this tray it goes in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.390 
laptop back into this tray it goes in
exactly<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.690> same<00:03:48.840> way<00:03:49.020> it's<00:03:49.200> two

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
exactly the same way it's two

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.100 
exactly the same way it's two
spring-loaded<00:03:50.400> opening<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
spring-loaded opening and then you just

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.350 
spring-loaded opening and then you just
drop<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.320> other<00:03:52.740> side<00:03:53.040> back<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.459> again<00:03:54.180> I've

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
drop the other side back in again I've

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.390 
drop the other side back in again I've
set<00:03:54.570> this<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.170> these<00:03:55.350> are<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.250> right

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
set this up so these are the right

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.320 
set this up so these are the right
height<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:56.970> laptop<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.780> now<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:59.120> can<00:04:00.120> close

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
height for my laptop and now I can close

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.330 
height for my laptop and now I can close
a<00:04:00.360> laptop<00:04:00.900> lid<00:04:01.140> but<00:04:01.650> still<00:04:01.920> have<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.190> support

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
a laptop lid but still have the support

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.690 
a laptop lid but still have the support
from<00:04:02.850> these<00:04:03.030> side<00:04:03.600> keepers<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:05.010> that's<00:04:05.580> a

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
from these side keepers so that's a

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.310 
from these side keepers so that's a
great<00:04:05.910> alternative<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.720> can<00:04:06.840> either<00:04:07.020> buy

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
great alternative so you can either buy

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.670 
great alternative so you can either buy
the<00:04:07.380> whole<00:04:08.120> mount<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.570> tray<00:04:09.900> with<00:04:10.200> these<00:04:10.380> flat

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
the whole mount the tray with these flat

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.590 
the whole mount the tray with these flat
side<00:04:10.920> keepers<00:04:11.340> or<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.030> can<00:04:12.150> actually<00:04:12.270> buy

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
side keepers or you can actually buy

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080 
side keepers or you can actually buy
these<00:04:12.660> little<00:04:13.110> pieces<00:04:13.260> separately<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.730> that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
these little pieces separately so that's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.490 
these little pieces separately so that's
your<00:04:15.239> choice<00:04:15.480> if<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.109> other<00:04:16.140> type

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
your choice if you have the other type

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.690 
your choice if you have the other type
and<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.770> want<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.980> swap<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.220> out<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.459> this

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and you want to swap it out for this

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.670 
and you want to swap it out for this
it's<00:04:18.270> just<00:04:18.330> as<00:04:18.570> simple<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:18.930> removing<00:04:19.410> them<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
it's just as simple as removing them and

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.420 
it's just as simple as removing them and
putting<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.520> onto<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:21.090> new<00:04:21.630> laptop<00:04:22.140> as<00:04:22.430> I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
putting it onto your new laptop as I

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.190 
putting it onto your new laptop as I
mentioned<00:04:24.150> before<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:26.370> can

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
mentioned before you can

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.130 
mentioned before you can
I'd<00:04:27.560> want<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:28.030> mount<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.270> side<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.900> so

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
I'd want to mount to the side of this so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.570 
I'd want to mount to the side of this so
there's<00:04:30.350> holes<00:04:30.680> on<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.920> side<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.280> tray

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
there's holes on the side of the tray

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.840 
there's holes on the side of the tray
where<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:32.540> can<00:04:32.690> just<00:04:32.960> hook<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.100> ram<00:04:34.640> mount

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
where you can just hook up a ram mount

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.160 
where you can just hook up a ram mount
with<00:04:35.090> just<00:04:35.270> one<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.480> these<00:04:35.570> diamond<00:04:35.960> plate

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
with just one of these diamond plate

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.890 
with just one of these diamond plate
bases<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:37.430> it's<00:04:37.550> generally<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:38.030> ram<00:04:38.270> v-102

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
bases so it's generally a ram v-102

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.800 
bases so it's generally a ram v-102
system<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.250> in<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.520> case<00:04:40.760> it's<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.030> ram<00:04:41.240> be<00:04:41.420> 102

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
system so in this case it's a ram be 102

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.460 
system so in this case it's a ram be 102
ap6<00:04:42.800> for<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> iphone<00:04:43.940> 3g<00:04:44.510> so<00:04:45.110> you'd<00:04:45.230> bolt

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
ap6 for the iphone 3g so you'd bolt

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.770 
ap6 for the iphone 3g so you'd bolt
these<00:04:45.620> on<00:04:45.830> here<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.970> then<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:47.390> see<00:04:47.570> you'd

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
these on here and then you can see you'd

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.330 
these on here and then you can see you'd
have<00:04:47.930> your<00:04:48.020> phone<00:04:48.290> right<00:04:48.590> there<00:04:48.830> at<00:04:49.100> easy

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
have your phone right there at easy

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.640 
have your phone right there at easy
access<00:04:49.850> so<00:04:50.390> if<00:04:50.450> that's<00:04:50.540> connected<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.530> can

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
access so if that's connected you can

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.260 
access so if that's connected you can
loosen<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.040> off<00:04:52.130> move<00:04:52.760> your<00:04:52.940> phone<00:04:53.120> around

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
loosen it off move your phone around

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.120 
loosen it off move your phone around

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
real easy on the ball and socket joint

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.490 
real easy on the ball and socket joint
as<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.390> see<00:04:56.570> here<00:04:56.780> landscape<00:04:57.260> portrait

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
as you can see here landscape portrait

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.520 
as you can see here landscape portrait
and<00:04:58.030> you're<00:04:59.030> good<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.240> go<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.720> that's<00:04:59.870> the<00:05:00.080> GPS

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
and you're good to go so that's the GPS

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.160 
and you're good to go so that's the GPS
phone<00:05:01.220> there<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.520> should<00:05:01.760> say<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.630> can<00:05:02.810> hook<00:05:03.020> up

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
phone there I should say you can hook up

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.790 
phone there I should say you can hook up
a<00:05:03.380> GPS<00:05:04.100> same<00:05:04.670> way<00:05:04.880> with<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.720> system<00:05:06.620> off<00:05:06.770> the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
a GPS same way with the system off the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.710 
a GPS same way with the system off the
side<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:07.940> there<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.150> have<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.420> there's<00:05:08.630> a
