flexible how to get flexible video

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
flexible how to get flexible video
because<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.660> am<00:00:40.290> NOT<00:00:40.620> naturally<00:00:41.100> flexible<00:00:41.280> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because I am NOT naturally flexible at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.420 
because I am NOT naturally flexible at
all<00:00:41.879> whatsoever<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:44.960> welven<00:00:45.960> um<00:00:46.430> continuing

so I thought of ways this was like

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.110 
so I thought of ways this was like
thirteen<00:00:50.280> year<00:00:50.370> old<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:50.880> like<00:00:50.970> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

thirteen year old me to get like as
flexible<00:00:51.630> as<00:00:51.870> quickly<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.350> possible<00:00:52.380> in<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
flexible as quickly as possible in a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.260 
flexible as quickly as possible in a
month<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.310> my<00:00:53.610> mind<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.150> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
month in my mind that was like the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
month in my mind that was like the
number<00:00:54.900> one<00:00:55.050> goal<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.380> I<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.710> I'll<00:00:56.130> do

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
number one goal so I was like I'll do

number one goal so I was like I'll do
anything<00:00:56.490> so<00:00:56.880> I<00:00:57.150> put<00:00:58.020> together<00:00:58.140> some

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
anything so I put together some

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
anything so I put together some
stretches<00:00:58.950> that<00:00:59.040> I<00:00:59.100> did<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.610> over<00:01:00.000> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.160 
so you can see right there my knee goes
almost<00:03:01.910> directly<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.660> my<00:03:02.780> toe

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
almost directly to my toe

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.600 
almost directly to my toe
and<00:03:03.260> then<00:03:03.739> after<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.220> when<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> feel

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
and then after that when I feel

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.930 
and then after that when I feel
comfortable<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:05.239> go<00:03:05.420> right<00:03:05.630> into<00:03:05.930> my<00:03:06.050> sweat<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
comfortable I go right into my sweat to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.759 
comfortable I go right into my sweat to
get<00:03:08.060> my<00:03:08.209> splits<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.690> help<00:03:08.870> them<00:03:09.019> for<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.320> minute

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
get my splits I help them for a minute

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.160 
get my splits I help them for a minute
each<00:03:09.980> day<00:03:10.310> morning<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.420> night<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> then<00:03:12.140> I

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
each day morning and night and then I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.960 
each day morning and night and then I
hate<00:03:12.500> middle<00:03:12.800> splits<00:03:13.070> I've<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.670> ate<00:03:13.790> them

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
hate middle splits I've really ate them

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.640 
hate middle splits I've really ate them
so<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.180> did<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.480> weird<00:03:14.720> seamless<00:03:15.200> judging<00:03:15.530> out

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
so I did this weird seamless judging out

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.870 
so I did this weird seamless judging out
then<00:03:15.830> we<00:03:15.920> actually<00:03:16.340> learned<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.670> shear

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
then we actually learned that shear

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.150 
then we actually learned that shear
force<00:03:17.150> we're<00:03:17.630> used<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:17.989> cheer<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.920> would<00:03:19.070> do

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
force we're used to cheer and I would do

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.780 
force we're used to cheer and I would do
this<00:03:19.280> for<00:03:19.340> about<00:03:19.610> 30<00:03:19.970> seconds<00:03:20.420> each<00:03:20.630> morning

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
this for about 30 seconds each morning

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
this for about 30 seconds each morning
so<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.820> do<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.360> cheer<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:23.780> college<00:03:23.810> anymore<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
so I do not cheer in college anymore so

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.520 
so I do not cheer in college anymore so
I<00:03:24.590> thought<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.070> would<00:03:25.160> be<00:03:25.280> fun<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.850> saw<00:03:26.530> you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
I thought it would be fun if I saw you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.680 
I thought it would be fun if I saw you
know<00:03:27.680> how<00:03:27.950> flexible<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.640> still<00:03:28.940> was<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.540> was

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
know how flexible I still was and I was

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.220 
know how flexible I still was and I was
kind<00:03:29.840> of

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
kind of

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.690 
kind of
first<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.620> was<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:31.159> was<00:03:31.220> literally<00:03:31.580> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
first I was like this was literally the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.920 
first I was like this was literally the
first<00:03:31.909> day<00:03:32.060> I've<00:03:32.150> tried<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.540> was<00:03:32.659> like<00:03:32.720> I

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
first day I've tried it I was like I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780 
first day I've tried it I was like I
probably<00:03:33.440> lost<00:03:33.620> almost<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.159> senility<00:03:34.430> who

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
probably lost almost like senility who

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.940 
probably lost almost like senility who
knows<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.390> even<00:03:35.480> do<00:03:36.080> my<00:03:36.230> splits<00:03:36.590> anymore

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
knows if I can even do my splits anymore

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.170 
knows if I can even do my splits anymore
and<00:03:37.099> that<00:03:37.190> was<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> really<00:03:37.640> scary<00:03:37.879> thought<00:03:38.150> to

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and that was a really scary thought to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.449 
and that was a really scary thought to
think<00:03:38.299> because<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:39.110> was<00:03:39.650> naturally<00:03:39.830> very<00:03:40.099> I'm

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
think because I was naturally very I'm

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.860 
think because I was naturally very I'm
flexible<00:03:40.849> when<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.060> was<00:03:41.209> younger<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.690> worked

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
flexible when I was younger and I worked

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.229 
flexible when I was younger and I worked
so<00:03:42.260> hard<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.530> get<00:03:42.650> my<00:03:42.799> flexibility<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.640> I

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
so hard to get my flexibility and I

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.030 
so hard to get my flexibility and I
guess<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.510> did<00:03:44.659> something<00:03:44.810> right<00:03:45.140> because<00:03:45.349> I

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
guess I did something right because I

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.920 
guess I did something right because I
actually<00:03:46.489> still<00:03:47.030> have<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.390> flexibility

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
actually still have that flexibility

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.809 
actually still have that flexibility
today<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.470> think<00:03:48.739> it's<00:03:49.280> kind<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.549> weird

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
today and I think it's kind of weird

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.100 
today and I think it's kind of weird
because<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.269> stop<00:03:50.569> stretching<00:03:51.019> you

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
because when you stop stretching you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.390 
because when you stop stretching you
would<00:03:51.260> think<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.530> would<00:03:51.620> lose<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.099> but<00:03:52.370> I

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
would think you would lose it but I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.309 
would think you would lose it but I
think<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.849> I<00:03:52.879> train<00:03:53.180> my<00:03:53.330> body<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:53.870> much<00:03:54.080> I'm

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
think that I train my body so much I'm

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.479 
think that I train my body so much I'm
kind<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.739> force<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.280> become

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
kind of like the force it to become

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.440 
kind of like the force it to become
flexible<00:03:56.030> at<00:03:56.209> like<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.390> younger<00:03:56.629> age<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:57.680> I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
flexible at like a younger age that I

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.550 
flexible at like a younger age that I
ended<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.569> being<00:03:59.780> able<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.170> keep<00:04:00.379> my

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
ended up being able to keep my

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.920 
ended up being able to keep my
flexibilities<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.760> was<00:04:02.239> like<00:04:02.390> okay<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.780> have

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
flexible for something so I thought it

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.339 
flexible for something so I thought it
would<00:04:14.269> be<00:04:14.329> interesting<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.750> do<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.079> I<00:04:15.170> hope
