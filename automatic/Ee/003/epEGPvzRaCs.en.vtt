00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:09.720
 You can't concentrate on the so-called high driving of this kind of drive 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 omar distraction 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:19.120
 I use English like driving distraction 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:25.420
 While connecting to the cloud to the young sons Yappa smartphone whether icloud 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:29.800
 Try running or you can use handsfree legally right now 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.590
 But when I'm actually talking handsfree , I'm quite conscious about it 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 Well do you particularly tricky 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:43.420
 I I think that does not go awareness to at all operation when I was something only a man and a woman of farewell version 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.200
 The So that the hands-free even in the lawful would be still dangerous 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.090
 I 'm thinking now in America 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 nhtsa from the administrative side 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 Put some of the guidelines I was out of the I, for example, a mobile phone Well in a hands-free 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.350
 when 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.809
 Do not try to 10 digits 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:10.299
 Although the put Toka in to how much character input is not to say that the car navigation system 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:15.820
 Well and intuitively he would try to do something other than 2 seconds when investigating switches 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:18.090
 Although the guidelines have come out and a public hearing is held in the US and discussed 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 In fact, it is this guideline 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.890
 If you look at it a little bit, based on the guidelines issued by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.390
 There is also a story that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 So it's quite easy to do two pillars but I'm doing something good 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.080
 Just because it 's not used widely in the table is Japan or the turn is by all means the country 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.180
 Because it has the licensing rights 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:48.340
 Automakers each other against the corner on? It's not it, such that the t's a good thing 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.030
 It is they also put out the id can not I different to the public that and say, system 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.400
 Place 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.130
 Toward the automobile manufacturers at the time of or well recall 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:03.440
 Many media are attacking why they do not apply for recall, but in fact 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 Recall that the car is that Toyota had such a problem from the country instead of sumo wrestling 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.330
 Manufacturer 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.030
 All the way to the documents and measures 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.860
 I suggest you call later 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:22.440
 There is the country's forgiveness to announce, so you can declare a recall 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:28.380
 So the Japanese system and the American system is so different to much even for this recall 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.020
 It is Showa who accuses Pelo who is why it is not recalled in Japan from a school building from the United States 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:38.770
 I feel a bit yesterday for extremes 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:46.270
 Even in the part where you do not have the right of license of such a country , how to regard the society for safety 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.680
 The strange thing is, anyway, is it safe if the country has the authorization right if it obeys the national safety standard star 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.819
 Is that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.970
 Generally we go, but it is 100 whether it is safe 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.410
 Even though we know so well in the primary problem listening to what people 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.830
 There are many 100% safe within 0 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:12.060
 So when the insect damage has occurred even if aligned 100 million per million is from the party 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:18.390
 Because You're is not so that had occurred in 100% of probability When you see 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.310
 The other self is an established Dondake depending on whether objectively look or position of the parties to see me 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.110
 I can't get rid of it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.490
 Ten 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.990
 I think there is 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:34.040
 So if 100% security can not be secured 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:35.300
 There was a risk but it was a little risk that we could use the wisdom to take measures 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.020
 There should be 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.480
 If cost is an enormous amount of enzyme for the measures it consensus is told in society 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.080
 Not 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:53.300
 Will take the measures while thinking Well cost-effective even though I 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:59.510
 Though we are just hearing the taste of the child medical care system 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.920
 It 's relatively big damage and rather than spending money on rare places like nothing 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.310
 Damaged 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.000
 Deer horn 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.180
 In frequency 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.370
 I think that it is Daiso to take measures, but the way of thinking for safety is decisive in Europe and America and Japan 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.630
 Japan is different in 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.440
 Regulation 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.389
 Intensify the human 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.719
 Severely Torishimare if safe minute 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:31.349
 The concept of Western things people make mistakes 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:37.919
 Therefore safely society middle to think the Fu that do not to be multiplied by the cost Western 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:39.420
 Was and I think again safety against thinking Japan is going to make the myth a rather 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.060
 Type of 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.040
 Yeah because it is often the concept 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.950
 Also the driver 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.950
 Driver is human beings make mistakes bear this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.350
 On the premise that it will malfunction 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.950
 Think disc 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.950
 We want to take various measures in that
