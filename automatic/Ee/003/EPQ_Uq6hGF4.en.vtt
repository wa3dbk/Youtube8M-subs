also the ps2 slim super slim also
requires<00:01:17.290> less<00:01:17.680> power

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
requires less power

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.300 
requires less power
the<00:01:18.700> usual<00:01:19.060> ports<00:01:19.510> such<00:01:19.780> as<00:01:19.990> USB<00:01:20.470> Ethernet

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the usual ports such as USB Ethernet

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
HDMI optical and AV still apply and this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.359 
HDMI optical and AV still apply and this
seems<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.320> be<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.560> general<00:01:26.590> feeling<00:01:27.130> with

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
seems to be the general feeling with

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.880 
seems to be the general feeling with
this<00:01:27.549> console<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.299> is<00:01:28.360> not<00:01:28.659> an<00:01:28.750> upgrade<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.530> is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
this console it is not an upgrade it is

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.249 
this console it is not an upgrade it is
merely<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.250> refining<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.479> previous<00:01:31.930> model

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
merely a refining of the previous model

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.980 
merely a refining of the previous model
partly<00:01:33.100> due<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.310> reduced<00:01:33.939> production<00:01:34.390> costs

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
partly due to reduced production costs

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.749 
partly due to reduced production costs
but<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.439> is<00:01:35.530> also<00:01:35.830> down<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.340> fact<00:01:36.580> that

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
but it is also down to the fact that

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.580 
but it is also down to the fact that
Sony<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.210> trying<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.659> squeeze<00:01:37.960> every<00:01:38.140> bit<00:01:38.560> of

Sony is trying to squeeze every bit of

Sony is trying to squeeze every bit of
profit<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.159> can<00:01:39.430> out<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.330> ps3<00:01:40.869> seeing<00:01:41.650> as

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
profit it can out of the ps3 seeing as

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.490 
profit it can out of the ps3 seeing as
the<00:01:41.979> ps4<00:01:42.250> s<00:01:42.670> release<00:01:43.000> date<00:01:43.270> is<00:01:43.420> still<00:01:43.600> over<00:01:44.470> a

before this model will be released it is
going<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.990> be<00:01:50.079> interesting<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.650> see<00:01:50.890> how<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
going to be interesting to see how and

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.560 
going to be interesting to see how and
when<00:01:51.729> Sony<00:01:52.090> pitch<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:53.170> ps4<00:01:53.470> against
