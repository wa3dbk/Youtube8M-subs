00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 on 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.280
 Let's take a look at the primary p 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.990
 I'll do it 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.910
 I'm going to look at the state law from the first bulls. 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:26.960
 And initially grasp the code in and out slowly let ai 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:30.050
 In this case, the thumb is the index finger, the finger of the child is the chin 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:35.530
 The fingers of the fingers were marked with the letter 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.530
 I'll try it slowly. 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:47.210
 I will try once again to Um um um 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.510
 It is mandatory in the middle-to-Flops and Baopuzi 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.649
 You should be careful to include building codes. 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 Next, I'll try to catch the observing- cutting code. 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.110
 Well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.010
 Next time, I'll take Seashin Miner Seven and give it a try. 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.010
 Well 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:24.729
 Let me try to connect the code with the same technique. 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:24.729
 Um um um coming Uhh 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.040
 Note that you point the thumb 5th on any routes and percussive law 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:39.530
 You can hit the pitch correctly. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:44.540
 Next, let's take a look at the main laws of chorus. 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:50.330
 I'll try to catch this major seven code first. 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.820
 To give effect to the first major ttonggu hated the departure from the code 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.070
 I'll give Seven. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.070
 Let's try to complete the technique of nature. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.930
 I will try to once again 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.930
 Ah 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.650
 Next, let's try the all-in code again and again. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.420
 Please note that in the middle of 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.510
 2 In order to give a dream effect to the slides by Edna in form 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.960
 On the rise of this flat 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.110
 I'll take care of it. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.560
 I'll go in slowly. 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.560
 Well 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.570
 we 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 I'll try again. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.760
 Next it was called Nuggets try to keep a low tide minor team code instructions 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.150
 If you use this fingering method 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.150
 It's possible 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.180
 And next time, 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310
 U 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.000
 I'll try the four codes one after the other. 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.000
 U 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.090
 wee 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:42.340
 a Edna Let 's grab this code and apply it to other states. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.340
 I will guarantee it in a clean way. 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.690
 Crime-rt I'll try to plaster 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.320
 As Nine and Week # - Have a Sighting 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.950
 I will try to apply 2 rhythms for this 2 days. 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.269
 I'll try to mix the sushi. 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.269
 U 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 on 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
 yeah 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.539
 Let's try it again . 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.539
 Ah 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.020
 on 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.060
 I will finish the state law explanation above 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.110
 222 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.110
 Oh
