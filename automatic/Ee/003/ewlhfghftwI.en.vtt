millimeter bolts one here and one back
there<00:00:43.250> you'll<00:00:44.250> probably<00:00:44.579> need<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> breaker<00:00:45.690> bar

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
there you'll probably need a breaker bar

there you'll probably need a breaker bar
to<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.170> those<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.510> use<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.500> ratchet

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to get those off I use the the ratchet

not destroy this pin when you take it
out<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.400> comes<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:14.970> easily<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
out it comes off very easily you just

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
out it comes off very easily you just
pull<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.549> side<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.390> slides<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pull one side out and it slides out it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
pull one side out and it slides out it's
it's<00:01:19.259> super<00:01:19.470> easy<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> take<00:01:19.979> off<00:01:20.159> when<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> see

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's super easy to take off when you see

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.920 
it's super easy to take off when you see
it<00:01:20.729> you'll<00:01:20.880> understand<00:01:23.630> you'll<00:01:24.630> need<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it you'll understand you'll need to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
it you'll understand you'll need to
separate<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> ball<00:01:25.650> joint<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> control

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
separate the ball joint from the control

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
separate the ball joint from the control
arm<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.479> ways<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> one

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
arm and there's two ways to do that one

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
arm and there's two ways to do that one
is<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> traditional<00:01:29.729> pickle<00:01:30.090> fork<00:01:30.299> like

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
is with a traditional pickle fork like

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
is with a traditional pickle fork like
this<00:01:31.070> put<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.250> grease<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.700> oil<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.119> there

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this put a little grease or oil on there

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.640 
this put a little grease or oil on there
before<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> may<00:01:34.290> minimize

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
before you do it and you may minimize

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
before you do it and you may minimize
the<00:01:34.829> chance<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.250> destroying<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.970> boot<00:01:36.900> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the chance of destroying that boot that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
the chance of destroying that boot that
covers<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> ball<00:01:37.650> joint<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.390> chances<00:01:39.390> are

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
covers the ball joint but chances are

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.889 
covers the ball joint but chances are
you'll<00:01:39.720> destroy<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> boot<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> use<00:01:40.619> this

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
you'll destroy the boot if you use this

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.660 
you'll destroy the boot if you use this
the<00:01:42.899> other<00:01:43.079> method<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> ball<00:01:44.430> joint

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the other method is with the ball joint

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.630 
the other method is with the ball joint
remover<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.680> these<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.070> little

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
remover like this these are a little

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760 
remover like this these are a little
more<00:01:47.790> tricky<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.270> use<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.140> seem<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
more tricky to use they I seem to have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.010 
more tricky to use they I seem to have
more<00:01:49.920> trouble<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.280> them<00:01:50.630> but<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.750> worth

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
more trouble with them but it's worth

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.940 
more trouble with them but it's worth
the<00:01:52.380> effort<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.560> how<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.590> use

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the effort to use this and how you use

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.289 
the effort to use this and how you use
this<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.600> take<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> nut<00:01:57.990> off<00:01:58.820> flip<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> upside

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
this is take the nut off flip it upside

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
this is take the nut off flip it upside
down<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.740> then<00:02:01.740> screw<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
down and then screw it on so that the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
down and then screw it on so that the
bolt<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.399> coming<00:02:05.939> through<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.200> you've

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bolt is coming through just so you've

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.230 
bolt is coming through just so you've
got<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.560> nice<00:02:07.770> big<00:02:07.799> flat<00:02:08.429> surface

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
got this nice big flat surface

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
for that to hit on and then you won't

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.330 
for that to hit on and then you won't
destroy<00:02:13.470> either<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.650> threads<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.190> ball

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
joint separator like this usually what

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.870 
joint separator like this usually what
I'll<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.220> I'll<00:02:21.310> get<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.550> nice<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.700> tight

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
I'll do is I'll get it nice and tight

and<00:02:22.240> I'll<00:02:22.930> usually<00:02:23.320> have<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.680> whack<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
and I'll usually have to whack it a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.040 
and I'll usually have to whack it a
little<00:02:24.490> bit<00:02:24.670> hit<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> control<00:02:25.270> arm<00:02:25.510> with<00:02:26.020> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
how it needs to be done you use the old

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.320 
how it needs to be done you use the old
bushing<00:03:05.500> as<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> reference<00:03:06.190> before<00:03:07.060> they<00:03:07.150> push

it<00:03:07.450> out<00:03:09.180> when<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.270> get<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> control<00:03:10.870> arm<00:03:11.110> back

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
it out when you get the control arm back

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.380 
it out when you get the control arm back
from<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.220> shop<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.460> pressed<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.270> new

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
from the shop that pressed in the new

from the shop that pressed in the new
bushing<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.860> back<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.490> pretty<00:03:15.940> simple

bushing going back in is pretty simple

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.190 
bushing going back in is pretty simple
you'll<00:03:17.710> just<00:03:17.890> fit<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.220> back<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.720> put<00:03:19.720> your<00:03:19.900> 19

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
you'll just fit it back in put your 19

this<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.870> one<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> found<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> little<00:03:23.890> tight

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
this this one I found is a little tight

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.100 
this this one I found is a little tight
because<00:03:24.550> it's<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:25.030> new<00:03:25.240> bushing<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.660> it's<00:03:26.020> going

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
because it's a new bushing so it's going

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.580 
because it's a new bushing so it's going
to<00:03:26.200> be<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> little<00:03:26.500> bit<00:03:27.750> less<00:03:28.750> compliant<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.500> you

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
to be a little bit less compliant so you

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.200 
to be a little bit less compliant so you
need<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:30.430> may<00:03:30.550> have<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.790> whack<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
need to you may have to whack it a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.490 
need to you may have to whack it a
little<00:03:31.360> bit<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.600> get<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.780> into<00:03:32.020> place

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
little bit to get it into place

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.140 
little bit to get it into place
you<00:03:32.980> know<00:03:33.070> hitting<00:03:33.280> on<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.430> control<00:03:33.730> arm<00:03:33.970> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
you know hitting on the control arm and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.730 
you know hitting on the control arm and
and<00:03:34.360> fiddling<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.260> get<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.470> go<00:03:35.560> back

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
and fiddling with it to get to go back

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.440 
and fiddling with it to get to go back
in<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:37.270> ball<00:03:37.930> joint<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.440> bottom<00:03:39.300> here<00:03:40.300> is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
in the ball joint on the bottom here is

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.450 
in the ball joint on the bottom here is
a<00:03:40.480> little<00:03:40.750> trick<00:03:41.110> for<00:03:41.590> putting<00:03:41.980> ball<00:03:42.160> joints

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
a little trick for putting ball joints

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.980 
a little trick for putting ball joints
back<00:03:42.580> together<00:03:44.940> jack<00:03:45.940> up<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.330> car<00:03:46.570> by<00:03:46.960> the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
back together jack up the car by the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.600 
back together jack up the car by the
control<00:03:47.500> arm<00:03:47.740> so<00:03:48.330> normally<00:03:49.330> if<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:50.580> put<00:03:51.580> a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
control arm so normally if you put a

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.610 
control arm so normally if you put a
ball<00:03:51.820> joint<00:03:52.000> back<00:03:52.240> together<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:53.350> put<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
ball joint back together and you put the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.700 
ball joint back together and you put the
nut<00:03:53.800> on<00:03:53.830> it'll<00:03:54.310> spin<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> whole<00:03:54.940> thing<00:03:55.710> when

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
nut on it'll spin the whole thing when
