clean kill Roy has been trying to keep

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.589 
clean kill Roy has been trying to keep
the<00:04:10.040> numbers<00:04:10.340> down<00:04:10.370> on<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:10.790> estate<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:11.449> there

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
the numbers down on the estate but there

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.869 
the numbers down on the estate but there
are<00:04:11.750> still<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.019> worrying<00:04:12.650> number<00:04:13.040> about<00:04:13.310> due<00:04:13.699> to

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
are still a worrying number about due to

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.360 
are still a worrying number about due to
nearby<00:04:14.120> urban<00:04:14.810> areas<00:04:15.259> and<00:04:15.470> fewer<00:04:16.070> people

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
nearby urban areas and fewer people

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.390 
nearby urban areas and fewer people
managing<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> land<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.870> think<00:04:18.799> because<00:04:19.250> we're

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
managing the land I think because we're

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.029 
managing the land I think because we're
quite<00:04:19.639> look<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.030> know<00:04:20.150> we're<00:04:20.269> quite<00:04:20.449> close<00:04:20.659> to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
quite look you know we're quite close to

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.290 
quite look you know we're quite close to
civilization<00:04:22.039> we<00:04:22.430> get<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.580> lot<00:04:22.729> of<00:04:22.759> influx<00:04:23.180> of

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
civilization we get a lot of influx of

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.570 
civilization we get a lot of influx of
foxes<00:04:23.630> coming<00:04:23.900> in<00:04:24.159> you<00:04:25.159> know<00:04:25.190> from<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
foxes coming in you know from the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.420 
foxes coming in you know from the
suburban<00:04:26.330> areas<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.949> they<00:04:27.949> come<00:04:28.130> into<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
suburban areas and they come into the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.060 
suburban areas and they come into the
into<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:28.970> park<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.740> over<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.889> sheep

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
into the park and over on the sheep

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.339 
into the park and over on the sheep
field<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.759> we<00:04:32.599> have<00:04:32.750> got<00:04:32.900> an<00:04:32.990> awful<00:04:33.229> lot<00:04:33.289> of

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
field so we have got an awful lot of

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.909 
field so we have got an awful lot of
foxes<00:04:33.680> around<00:04:33.949> I<00:04:34.159> think<00:04:35.050> really<00:04:36.050> where<00:04:36.380> we're

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
foxes around I think really where we're

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.920 
foxes around I think really where we're
not<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.550> area<00:04:37.789> that<00:04:38.419> we're<00:04:38.539> living<00:04:38.659> in

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
not in this area that we're living in

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.629 
not in this area that we're living in
now<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.500> haven't<00:04:39.680> got<00:04:39.800> as<00:04:40.130> many<00:04:40.310> full-time

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
now we haven't got as many full-time

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.700 
now we haven't got as many full-time
keepers<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.360> lot<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.169> there's<00:04:42.409> a<00:04:42.470> lot<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
keepers a lot of there's a lot of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.870 
keepers a lot of there's a lot of
part-time<00:04:42.979> keepers<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.430> whatever<00:04:43.580> else<00:04:43.759> and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
part-time keepers and whatever else and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.010 
part-time keepers and whatever else and
they<00:04:44.000> just<00:04:44.150> haven't<00:04:44.330> got<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.479> time<00:04:44.659> to<00:04:44.840> do<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
they just haven't got the time to do the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110 
they just haven't got the time to do the
Fox<00:04:45.199> control<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:46.099> you<00:04:46.190> are<00:04:46.310> seeing<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.729> large

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
Fox control so you are seeing a large

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.330 
Fox control so you are seeing a large
increase<00:04:47.419> in<00:04:47.509> the<00:04:47.659> number<00:04:47.900> of<00:04:47.930> foxes<00:04:51.159> and<00:04:52.159> he

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
increase in the number of foxes and he

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.670 
increase in the number of foxes and he
gets<00:04:52.550> another<00:04:52.849> before<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.360> night<00:04:53.509> is<00:04:53.539> out<00:04:53.840> but

gets another before the night is out but

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.680 
gets another before the night is out but
Roy<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:54.919> frustrated<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:55.940> feels<00:04:56.210> we<00:04:56.419> could

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
Roy is frustrated and feels we could

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.730 
Roy is frustrated and feels we could
have<00:04:56.810> done<00:04:57.020> better

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
have done better

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.459 
have done better
a<00:04:58.300> very<00:04:59.300> frustrating<00:04:59.479> night<00:04:59.990> tonight<00:05:00.259> though

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
a very frustrating night tonight though

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.020 
a very frustrating night tonight though
we<00:05:00.620> should<00:05:00.770> have<00:05:00.860> should<00:05:01.639> have<00:05:01.729> had<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.849> few

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
we should have should have had a few

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.670 
we should have should have had a few
more<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.389> back<00:05:02.539> that<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:03.169> was<00:05:03.380> surprised

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680

actually<00:05:03.830> how<00:05:04.039> many<00:05:04.099> foxes<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.550> saw<00:05:04.699> at<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.650> I

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
actually how many foxes we saw at it I

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.080 
actually how many foxes we saw at it I
think<00:05:07.009> we'll<00:05:07.099> have<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.310> try<00:05:07.460> harder<00:05:07.699> next<00:05:07.820> time

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
think we'll have to try harder next time
