00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
next level this isn't much of a problem

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.710 
but if you're a newcomer to this game
this<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.069> quite<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.340> huge<00:02:46.730> issue<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.390> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
this is quite a huge issue and it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.240 
this is quite a huge issue and it
certainly<00:02:47.900> was<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.319> me<00:02:48.470> because<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.890> was<00:02:49.040> lost

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250

straight<00:02:51.349> minutes<00:02:53.049> another<00:02:54.049> problem<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
straight minutes another problem is the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.309 
straight minutes another problem is the
enemies<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:56.180> take<00:02:56.420> too<00:02:56.629> many<00:02:56.780> bullets<00:02:57.200> to

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.710 
enemies they take too many bullets to
kill<00:02:57.349> with<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.739> regular<00:02:58.099> pistol<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.480> ran

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
kill with the regular pistol so you ran

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.839 
kill with the regular pistol so you ran
into<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.989> huge<00:03:00.260> group<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.560> aliens<00:03:00.709> all<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.670> which

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
into a huge group of aliens all of which

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.240 
into a huge group of aliens all of which
are<00:03:01.970> out<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.239> kill<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.200> run<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.650> ammo

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
are out to kill you you run out of ammo

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.770 
are out to kill you you run out of ammo
for<00:03:04.430> all<00:03:04.579> other<00:03:04.819> weapons<00:03:05.209> except<00:03:05.569> for<00:03:05.690> the

for all other weapons except for the

for all other weapons except for the
pistol<00:03:06.260> which<00:03:06.620> has<00:03:06.769> unlimited<00:03:07.280> ammo<00:03:07.549> anyway

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
pistol which has unlimited ammo anyway

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.569 
pistol which has unlimited ammo anyway
it's<00:03:08.629> all<00:03:08.930> you've<00:03:09.170> got<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.829> it's<00:03:10.160> practically

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
it's all you've got and it's practically

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.099 
it's all you've got and it's practically
useless<00:03:10.819> against<00:03:11.359> an<00:03:11.450> entire<00:03:11.720> horde<00:03:12.019> of

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
useless against an entire horde of

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.569 
useless against an entire horde of
aliens<00:03:12.560> because<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.069> take<00:03:13.220> about<00:03:13.430> an

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
aliens because it can take about an

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.569 
aliens because it can take about an
entire<00:03:13.910> minute<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.420> kill<00:03:14.599> just<00:03:14.810> one<00:03:15.049> alien

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
entire minute to kill just one alien

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.949 
entire minute to kill just one alien
it's<00:03:16.579> basically<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.060> waste<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.390> time<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.750> just

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
it's basically a waste of time to just

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.420 
it's basically a waste of time to just
try<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.230> kill<00:03:18.530> these<00:03:18.739> things<00:03:19.040> because<00:03:19.250> you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
try and kill these things because you

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.920 
try and kill these things because you
know<00:03:19.519> what's<00:03:19.670> going<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.819> happen<00:03:19.910> you're<00:03:20.810> going

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
know what's going to happen you're going

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
know what's going to happen you're going
to<00:03:20.989> be<00:03:21.079> backed<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.410> into<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.680> corner<00:03:22.129> and<00:03:22.160> killed

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
to be backed up into a corner and killed

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.729 
to be backed up into a corner and killed
within<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.730> few<00:03:22.910> seconds<00:03:23.269> anyway<00:03:23.629> game<00:03:24.290> over

within a few seconds anyway game over

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.009 
within a few seconds anyway game over
and<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.849> problem<00:03:26.120> doesn't<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.690> sent<00:03:26.900> her

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
and this problem doesn't just sent her

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.259 
and this problem doesn't just sent her
around<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.560> aliens<00:03:28.010> because<00:03:28.430> even<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:28.910> human

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
around the aliens because even the human

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.240 
around the aliens because even the human
enemies<00:03:29.629> take<00:03:29.840> about<00:03:30.049> six<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.470> ten<00:03:30.650> hits<00:03:30.889> die

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
enemies take about six to ten hits die

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.900 
enemies take about six to ten hits die
do<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.150> that's<00:03:32.269> enough<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:34.489> now<00:03:34.700> that

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
do you think that's enough but now that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.250 
do you think that's enough but now that
I've<00:03:35.030> cleared<00:03:35.359> those<00:03:35.480> problems<00:03:35.930> out<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.169> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
I've cleared those problems out of the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.839 
I've cleared those problems out of the
way<00:03:36.410> let's<00:03:36.590> finish<00:03:36.950> this<00:03:37.220> review<00:03:37.669> on<00:03:37.700> a
