00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.560 
accident now of course the downside of
her<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.790> she's<00:01:30.030> getting<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.420> old

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
her is that she's getting pretty old

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
her is that she's getting pretty old
she's<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.170> 40<00:01:31.650> years<00:01:31.890> old<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.759> would

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
she's about 40 years old so they would

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.510 
she's about 40 years old so they would
start<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.450> she<00:01:33.630> probably<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.079> 43<00:01:34.590> 42

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
start this she probably like 43 42

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.359
