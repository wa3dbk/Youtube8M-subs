with<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.530> actual<00:01:41.130> quote<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:42.420> from

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
with this actual quote is actually from

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
with this actual quote is actually from
the<00:01:42.750> monkey<00:01:43.049> bomb<00:01:43.259> itself<00:01:43.829> Ashley's<00:01:44.490> song

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the monkey bomb itself Ashley's song

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.520 
the monkey bomb itself Ashley's song
starts<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> finish<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:46.170> before<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
starts to finish and right before it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
starts to finish and right before it
explodes<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.399> monkey<00:01:47.729> bomb<00:01:47.909> will<00:01:48.299> actually

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
explodes the monkey bomb will actually

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
explodes the monkey bomb will actually
say<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.930> zombies<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.799> ready<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> surprise

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
say in zombies get ready for a surprise

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.120 
say in zombies get ready for a surprise
so<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.479> quote<00:01:51.689> itself<00:01:52.110> isn't<00:01:52.350> any<00:01:52.649> hint<00:01:52.979> at

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so the quote itself isn't any hint at

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
so the quote itself isn't any hint at
all<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.909> rather<00:01:54.180> paying<00:01:54.659> homage<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
all it's just rather paying homage to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.499 
all it's just rather paying homage to
what<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> actual<00:01:56.280> monkey<00:01:56.640> bomb<00:01:56.850> says<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
what the actual monkey bomb says and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.569 
what the actual monkey bomb says and
does<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:58.229> before<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> explodes<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> goes

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
does right before it explodes and goes

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
does right before it explodes and goes
off<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> cool<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.960> quote<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
off so it's a cool little quote and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.539 
off so it's a cool little quote and
definitely<00:02:01.770> something<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.250> excited

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
definitely something they get excited

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.240 
definitely something they get excited
for<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.540> anything<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.890> hint

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
for but not anything if that is a hint

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
for but not anything if that is a hint
that<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> people<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.390> taking<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that a lot of people are taking it as

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
that a lot of people are taking it as
but<00:02:07.439> being<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> originated<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.610> der<00:02:08.970> riese

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
but being that originated in der riese

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.390 
but being that originated in der riese
and<00:02:09.450> has<00:02:09.629> been<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> staple<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.619> zombies<00:02:11.220> up

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and has been a staple of zombies up

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.930 
and has been a staple of zombies up
until<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> very<00:02:12.150> end<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
until the very end of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.060 
until the very end of
black<00:02:13.120> ops<00:02:13.420> 2<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.440> pretty<00:02:14.590> much<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.770> safe

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
black ops 2 here it's pretty much a safe

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.320 
black ops 2 here it's pretty much a safe
assumption<00:02:15.430> though<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.910> they<00:02:16.030> will<00:02:16.300> be

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
assumption though that they will be

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300 
assumption though that they will be
returning<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> any<00:02:17.830> sort<00:02:18.190> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
returning if there is any sort of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.130 
returning if there is any sort of
connection<00:02:18.700> back<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.240> what<00:02:19.630> we<00:02:19.750> know<00:02:19.930> as

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
connection back to what we know as

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.200 
connection back to what we know as
zombies<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:21.130> truck<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:21.700> definitely<00:02:22.120> going

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
zombies I know truck is definitely going

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.000 
zombies I know truck is definitely going
to<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.360> potentially<00:02:23.110> looking<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.650> something

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
to be potentially looking at something

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.830 
to be potentially looking at something
that<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.580> flip<00:02:24.880> our<00:02:25.060> knowledge<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that can flip our knowledge and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.750 
that can flip our knowledge and
understanding<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.440> zombies<00:02:26.920> upside<00:02:27.340> down<00:02:27.550> but

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
understanding of zombies upside down but

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.340 
understanding of zombies upside down but
still<00:02:27.850> make<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.240> completely<00:02:28.720> fun<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
still make it completely fun and

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.480 
still make it completely fun and
something<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.830> we<00:02:30.010> want<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> play

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
something that we want to play

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.670 
something that we want to play
constantly<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:31.780> assuming<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.560> is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
constantly but I'm assuming that this is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.170 
constantly but I'm assuming that this is
going<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.070> no-brainer<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.610> monkey

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
going to be a no-brainer that monkey

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.360 
going to be a no-brainer that monkey
bombs<00:02:34.360> will<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.840> returning<00:02:35.320> here<00:02:35.740> if<00:02:36.040> there's

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
bombs will be returning here if there's

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.340 
bombs will be returning here if there's
anything<00:02:36.640> connecting<00:02:37.330> back<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.960> original

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
anything connecting back to the original

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.870 
anything connecting back to the original
storyline<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:39.070> anything<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:39.700> know<00:02:39.850> of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
storyline or anything that we know of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.300 
storyline or anything that we know of
zombies<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:40.780> far<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> said<00:02:41.770> just<00:02:42.190> because

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
zombies so far like I said just because

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.100 
zombies so far like I said just because
it<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.610> stable<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.780> right<00:02:43.870> now<00:02:43.900> we

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
it is a stable but for right now we

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.270 
it is a stable but for right now we
can't<00:02:44.440> really<00:02:44.590> assume<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.040> david

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
can't really assume that david

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.010 
can't really assume that david
vonderhaar<00:02:45.490> is<00:02:45.850> hinting<00:02:46.240> one<00:02:46.570> way<00:02:46.780> or<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
vonderhaar is hinting one way or the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.990 
vonderhaar is hinting one way or the
other<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.740> we<00:02:48.160> can't<00:02:48.430> make<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> assumption

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
other but we can't make the assumption

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910 
other but we can't make the assumption
that<00:02:49.180> we<00:02:49.450> will<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.960> seeing<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.620> like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
that we will you seeing this here like

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.100 
that we will you seeing this here like
every<00:02:51.310> other<00:02:51.490> treyarch<00:02:52.180> title<00:02:52.570> in<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> past

every other treyarch title in the past

every other treyarch title in the past
couple<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.590> years<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.490> definitely<00:02:54.760> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
couple of years but it definitely is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.970 
couple of years but it definitely is
something<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.050> hype<00:02:56.290> rolling<00:02:56.770> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
something to get the hype rolling and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.800 
something to get the hype rolling and
nonetheless<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.300> worth<00:02:58.360> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
nonetheless and for what it's worth I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.690 
nonetheless and for what it's worth I
definitely<00:02:59.350> am<00:02:59.500> excited<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.430> see<00:03:00.580> the
