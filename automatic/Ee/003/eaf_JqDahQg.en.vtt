00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.460
 the neighboring clinic of olive groves and your 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.800
 vet point info today I want 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.929
 tell you about one of the most important causes 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.730
 frequent that dogs come to the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.860
 veterinary clinic to see us and that are 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.419
 gastroenteric problems in particular 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.149
 today we are going to talk about the problems of 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.770
 Vomiting vomiting is one of the 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.710
 most frequent causes as I say that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.140
 a dog come to the consultation and good 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.720
 They can have many causes 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 associated with them the first thing we have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.219
 what to differentiate when a dog has 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.010
 Some vomit is if it is vomit as such 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 or is it a problem of regurgitation the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 regurgitation is the expulsion of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.859
 content but not from the stomach but 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 from the esophagus and usually go through 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.390
 when there is a foreign body at the level of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.489
 esophagus when there is some tumor process 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 that may be preventing a step 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 normal by the esophagus some anomaly of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 vascular rings level groups 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.980
 at heart they can press also 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.839
 this esophagus well that's going to prevent 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 that there is a step of the food with 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.540
 normality through the esophagus and accumulate 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.030
 the content and end up expelling 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.560
 this is what is called a 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.000
 regurgitation and I already say that you have to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.840
 differentiate the vomit that is the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.490
 expulsion of stomach contents 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 as we said cause of vomiting there 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 many and they are not all of digestive type 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.110
 Well, there are also systemic diseases 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.850
 penalties that affect which peron others 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.310
 organs but that have an impact 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.890
 at the level of the stomach as they can be 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.229
 More small skin tumors may 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.370
 lead to a picture of vomiting 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.180
 endocrine problems as is a 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.440
 accentuation diabetic sis problems 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.420
 dilation of good stomach that in this 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.759
 case yes it would be a typical problem of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.910
 stomach but not as irritation 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.190
 of his peers as such 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.750
 but the various causes of vomiting 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.250
 guÃ¡rico the ingestion of medicines of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.050
 toxic that give rise to that they can 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.690
 appear vomiting without being the cause 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.340
 simply vomiting digestive also 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.440
 we may have to be acute or chronic 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.180
 the acute vomiting will be those 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 moments that occur even in 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.610
 a matter of hours a matter of days what 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.229
 that we have a dog with vomiting and the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.899
 chronic vomiting are those that are tested 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.450
 in weeks time 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.220
 or even months then we're going to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.930
 refer today more specifically to what 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.790
 are the acute vomiting and that many 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.739
 times are reasons for the number of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 assistance urgency of dogs with 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.549
 these pictures then in the vomiting 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.099
 treble we can find ourselves as 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.439
 we said then diverse causes as can 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.519
 be good so there is a 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.290
 food incongruence has eaten the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.480
 dog something that has hurt him 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.079
 because he feels bad because he has some 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.079
 substance that does bad to the dog 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.239
 the presence of foreign bodies by the 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.639
 ingesting a stone from a stick by 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.340
 example that what discussed earlier 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.250
 of a stomach hydration also 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.900
 causes vomiting to appear on the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.849
 disease and precious problems 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.900
 how can it be distemper parvovirus 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:02.799
 lengthen also checkered with vomiting 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.599
 Well, a series of medications 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.980
 toxic products that as such I entered 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.290
 in contact with the stomach wall 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.060
 causing irritation ulceration 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.639
 it also results in these moments are 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.349
 the acute vomiting then we 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.210
 we always advise good except for 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.980
 vomiting that occur 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.350
 the cases of the animals traveling the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.970
 they call cineto if they are typical of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.220
 people even when they go by car 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.630
 because they get dizzy and can vomit like 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.890
 to be our animals as a 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.020
 vomit that does not have actually greater 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.580
 importance and if still knowing that 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.170
 our dog has this kind of evidence 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.780
 Well, we can prevent them with monkeys 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.810
 Well, the medicines that there are 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.610
 reach of all of you to be 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.140
 can administer to the dog before 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.940
 travel and avoid appearing that kind of 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.010
 Vomiting because as I said this moment is 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.620
 the least important we vomiting 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.300
 you should always be good 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.100
 always under surveillance because it 's very 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.680
 difficult to know exactly the cause that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.230
 originates it as if we see our dog 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.600
 that a plant is taken afterwards can be 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.670
 irritant for example and a little bit 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.750
 pretty we do not know what the cause is 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.420
 normally there will not be any 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.910
 problem and with a little rest 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.890
 digestive 12 24 hours is going to be 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.570
 enough for that stomach to be little 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.760
 march through without problems but 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.640
 If we have doubts about the cause of 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.400
 Vomiting lasts more than one two 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.150
 three four five vomiting followed one or 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.590
 two days 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 they are things that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.460
 you always have to pay close attention 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.650
 because I say we can be before 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.949
 a disease that I can stop doing 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.080
 be dangerous then according to the type of 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.850
 process that cause acute vomiting will 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.860
 to require good as a type of 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.840
 treatment or another is not going to be the same 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.240
 treat vomiting but because there 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.669
 eaten a strange body that sometimes 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.620
 requires even surgery 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.690
 stomach to extract that body that 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 foreign body to a vomit produced 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.490
 because as we said before because the worst 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.440
 have eaten a plant destined content 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.120
 toxic and this is going to originate a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 gastritis that does not have to originate 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.960
 more pictures more serious paintings 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.790
 then whenever a picture appears 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.040
 of vomiting we should consult with 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.300
 our veterinarian if we know that he has 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.370
 been able to ingest the dog can 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.660
 consult the and those of the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.950
 relevant instructions on what 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.400
 we have to do I tell you that 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.990
 normally the vomiting one of the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.270
 ways to treat it and especially when 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.430
 they are slight going to be fasting to make a 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.250
 diet for 12 24 hours so that that 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.650
 stomach return to normal 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.289
 pass that invitation and the animal can 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.360
 again back to eating foods 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.599
 well, it is recommended that there be a diet 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.749
 softer already prepared for this type 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.909
 of problems and in a 24 48 hours by 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.559
 this but will return to his life again 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.659
 completely normal 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.729
 if those vomits are not controlled with the 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.499
 cause can be harder to 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.330
 investigate and you would have to appeal for 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.159
 Well, those studies with x-rays or 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.409
 analytics looking for the origin of the 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.180
 vomiting but you're always going to have to 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.729
 be under the supervision of a 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.469
 veterinarian then remember that good 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.899
 it is important that before a table of 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.969
 Vomiting, we always consult because it is not 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:03.099
 the same thing a vomit as we said in a 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:06.430
 dog that travels to a vomit by the 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.779
 possible ingestion of a toxic or some 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.719
 another disease that may be 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.369
 originating this this picture as can 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.919
 be a diabetic acidosis center that 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.689
 Well, it can be a problem even 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.249
 fatal if no action is taken 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.439
 opportunity as quickly as possible 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.689
 I hope this talk visit has 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.519
 been useful and you know that the 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.019
 we have at our disposal in our 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:31.159
 telephone number that appears in the 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:36.249
 page and on this same page of www 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:36.249
 I finished point info point thanks
