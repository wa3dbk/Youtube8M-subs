00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
into a cut test on this first off it is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.319 
into a cut test on this first off it is
a<00:00:47.059> three<00:00:48.059> inch<00:00:48.300> cutting<00:00:48.749> edge<00:00:49.039> ceramic<00:00:50.039> blade

a three inch cutting edge ceramic blade
the<00:00:51.329> scales<00:00:51.659> are<00:00:52.050> four<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> half<00:00:52.800> inches

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the scales are four and a half inches

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
the scales are four and a half inches
long<00:00:54.170> what<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.379> impressed<00:00:55.710> about<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
long what I was impressed about is that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.529 
long what I was impressed about is that
it<00:00:56.850> only<00:00:56.969> weighs<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:58.170> ounces<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.420> ask

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it only weighs two ounces and you ask

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.809 
it only weighs two ounces and you ask
yourself<00:01:00.719> John<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.649> ounces<00:01:02.129> how<00:01:02.339> do<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.579> get

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
yourself John two ounces how do they get

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.479 
yourself John two ounces how do they get
that<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.949> take<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.190> look<00:01:05.400> at

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that well for one let's take a look at

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.570 
that well for one let's take a look at
the<00:01:05.580> scales<00:01:05.930> they're<00:01:06.930> carbon<00:01:07.380> fiber<00:01:07.890> scales

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the scales they're carbon fiber scales

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.410 
the scales they're carbon fiber scales
and<00:01:09.380> they<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:10.740> nice<00:01:11.160> cross<00:01:11.790> pattern<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and they do this nice cross pattern on

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.110 
and they do this nice cross pattern on
there<00:01:12.660> just<00:01:12.990> looks<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.890> cool<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.060> don't

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
there just looks really cool and I don't

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.700 
there just looks really cool and I don't
know<00:01:15.300> if<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.480> camera<00:01:15.840> will<00:01:15.960> pick<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.410> but

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
know if the camera will pick it up but

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.820 
know if the camera will pick it up but
it<00:01:17.400> almost<00:01:17.610> looks<00:01:17.880> 3d<00:01:18.480> it<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.960> pops<00:01:19.620> right

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it almost looks 3d it just pops right

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
it almost looks 3d it just pops right
out<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:21.990> side<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> nice<00:01:23.670> pocket

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
out the other side has a nice pocket

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.400 
out the other side has a nice pocket
clip<00:01:24.510> and<00:01:25.730> you<00:01:26.730> have<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.120> liner<00:01:27.720> lock<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
clip and you have your liner lock on the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.510 
clip and you have your liner lock on the
inside<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.190> it's<00:01:30.860> doing<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> retention<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
inside and it's doing a retention of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.570 
inside and it's doing a retention of
about<00:01:32.790> 50<00:01:33.390> percent<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> blades<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.620> that's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
about 50 percent of the blades so that's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.140 
about 50 percent of the blades so that's
really<00:01:35.910> good<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.600> securing<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> blade<00:01:38.150> now

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
really good at securing that blade now

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
really good at securing that blade now
the<00:01:39.780> ceramic<00:01:40.290> finish<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.900> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the ceramic finish on here this is a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
the ceramic finish on here this is a
durable<00:01:43.920> coating<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.970> charade<00:01:45.780> calls<00:01:46.140> their

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
durable coating what charade calls their

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.910 
durable coating what charade calls their
black<00:01:47.280> scratch<00:01:47.880> resistant<00:01:48.510> coating<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
black scratch resistant coating and they

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
black scratch resistant coating and they
add<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.460> by<00:01:50.790> doing<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.330> hot<00:01:51.570> isostatic

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
add that by doing a hot isostatic

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.340 
add that by doing a hot isostatic
pressing<00:01:52.520> process<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:54.480> charade<00:01:54.930> claims

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
pressing process which charade claims

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.280 
pressing process which charade claims
will<00:01:55.830> strengthen<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> blade<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.900> with<00:01:58.140> any

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
will strengthen the blade now with any

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.110 
will strengthen the blade now with any
ceramic<00:01:58.920> blade<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.900> can't<00:02:01.230> be<00:02:02.000> treating<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
ceramic blade you can't be treating it

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.840 
ceramic blade you can't be treating it
like<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.810> steel<00:02:04.620> blade<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.400> I'm<00:02:05.520> talking

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
like a steel blade and what I'm talking

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.300 
like a steel blade and what I'm talking
about<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.420> hard<00:02:06.630> impact<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:07.350> doing

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
about that is hard impact just doing

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
about that is hard impact just doing
thrash<00:02:08.610> tests<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.179> you're<00:02:09.300> stabbing

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
thrash tests where you're stabbing

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.209 
thrash tests where you're stabbing
things<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.900> ceramic<00:02:13.219> my

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
things and like that because ceramic my

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.610 
things and like that because ceramic my
opinion<00:02:14.700> is

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
opinion is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.530 
opinion is
a<00:02:15.650> little<00:02:16.040> bit<00:02:16.160> brittle<00:02:16.459> er<00:02:16.700> than<00:02:16.910> steel<00:02:17.240> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
a little bit brittle er than steel and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.990 
a little bit brittle er than steel and
you're<00:02:18.410> gonna<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.860> probably<00:02:19.670> blades

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
you're gonna have probably blades
