00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.050
 the sony ericsson xperia pro 2 sk 17 is 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.540
 a good option for you to look for a 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.599
 phone that has a good performance 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.960
 the battery a very good screen 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.269
 resolution of very good quality in addition 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.789
 from a camera and I had very good 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:26.890
 pictures this cell phone and it has a 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.369
 small inconvenience that you found 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.920
 nothing but the speaker 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.920
 rear the rear speaker 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:44.080
 With all merit we just have to reason 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:49.180
 with rhythms the horn disappears by 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.740
 complete the cement what it produces if 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.070
 when we have it in the bag, it is not 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.290
 you can hear the call quite well 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 incoming can try it look 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.070
 this was covered by the finger that the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.690
 horn vibrations 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.690
 and leave the super would be more 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.799
 out of that the cell phone is very fast 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.869
 very fluid did not get stuck in all the 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.119
 time I've had the answer in 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.159
 perfect screens no tick 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.390
 multitouch supports up to 5 presses 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.369
 most applications are 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.340
 compatible with exception now 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 example of one of the game boy emulator 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.720
 advance that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.290
 and for some reason when trying 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 to load the roms 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.210
 this application comes out the demon 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.789
 who boy advance is the only application 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.329
 with which he has had problems all the 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.360
 the rest 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:56.829
 message file managers 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.689
 text are excellent the truth is not 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.530
 will regret buying the camera 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:06.280
 some very good results has flash 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 led and the 5 megapixel camera makes 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.410
 very good work in the approaches in 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 order if you have any other questions comment and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900
