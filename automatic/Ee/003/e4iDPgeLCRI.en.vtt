about the strawberry protein um I had

with it and different stuff but bringing
in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.480> had<00:00:21.750> banana

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
in the first one and I had banana

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.510 
in the first one and I had banana
the<00:00:24.370> other<00:00:24.520> one<00:00:24.760> with

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.140 

strawberries<00:00:28.520> and<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:29.869> had

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
strawberries and I had

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.620 
strawberries and I had
I<00:00:31.240> think<00:00:31.630> was<00:00:31.779> grapes<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:33.120> something<00:00:34.120> else<00:00:34.239> in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
I think was grapes and something else in

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
I think was grapes and something else in
the<00:00:35.140> last<00:00:35.380> run<00:00:35.650> with<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.980> strawberry<00:00:36.340> um<00:00:36.880> they

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the last run with the strawberry um they

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.220 
the last run with the strawberry um they
they<00:00:39.190> didn't<00:00:39.489> taste<00:00:39.670> very<00:00:39.790> good<00:00:40.030> e<00:00:40.360> any<00:00:40.960> of

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
they didn't taste very good e any of

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.460 
they didn't taste very good e any of
them<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.000> brand<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.600> probably<00:00:44.199> the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
them I think the brand was probably the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.250 
them I think the brand was probably the
best<00:00:44.860> tasting<00:00:45.370> one<00:00:45.610> out<00:00:45.940> of<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.300> mall<00:00:46.510> which

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
best tasting one out of the mall which

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.450 
best tasting one out of the mall which
is<00:00:47.410> kind<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.010> surprising<00:00:48.160> um

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.389 

the<00:00:52.059> great<00:00:52.329> one<00:00:52.660> had<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.079> worst<00:00:53.590> texture<00:00:54.280> in

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
the great one had the worst texture in

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.900 
the great one had the worst texture in
the<00:00:54.520> world<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:55.180> was<00:00:55.360> kind<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.690> like<00:00:55.840> soupy<00:00:56.290> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the world it was kind of like soupy and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.490 
the world it was kind of like soupy and
I<00:00:57.910> think<00:00:58.180> about<00:00:58.300> too<00:00:58.570> much<00:00:58.829> water<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:01.500> anyway

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
I think about too much water but anyway

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.040 
I think about too much water but anyway
the<00:01:02.920> last<00:01:03.160> ones<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.850> had<00:01:04.119> they<00:01:04.989> were

the last ones that I had they were

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.410 
the last ones that I had they were
really<00:01:05.409> good<00:01:05.590> because<00:01:05.800> I<00:01:06.460> went<00:01:06.850> out<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.030> I

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
really good because I went out and I

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.800
