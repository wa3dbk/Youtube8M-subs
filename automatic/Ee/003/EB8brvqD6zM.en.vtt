00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
to immigration I have actually put more

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.940 
to immigration I have actually put more
money<00:01:58.799> under<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.640> administration<00:01:59.930> into

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
border security than any other

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.410 
border security than any other
administration<00:02:03.560> previously<00:02:04.560> we've<00:02:04.770> got<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
administration previously we've got more

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
administration previously we've got more
security<00:02:06.420> resources<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> border<00:02:07.950> more

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
security resources at the border more

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.150

name it than the previous administration

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.490 
name it than the previous administration
so<00:02:14.459> we've<00:02:14.640> ramped<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.180> significantly<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so we've ramped up significantly the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.830 
so we've ramped up significantly the
issue<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.890> border<00:02:17.130> security<00:02:17.660> what<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> have

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
issue of border security what I have

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
issue of border security what I have
also<00:02:19.290> said<00:02:19.560> though<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.069> if<00:02:20.670> we're<00:02:20.849> going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
also said though is that if we're going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.559 
also said though is that if we're going
to<00:02:21.030> solve<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.569> problem<00:02:22.050> then<00:02:23.180> given<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
to solve the problem then given the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.309 
to solve the problem then given the
massive<00:02:25.130> border<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.110> south

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
massive border that we have on the south

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.170 
massive border that we have on the south
and<00:02:28.620> by<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> way<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.130> massive<00:02:29.790> border<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and by the way a massive border on the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.680 
and by the way a massive border on the
North<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.630> nobody<00:02:30.930> talks<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
North that nobody talks about that the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.630 
North that nobody talks about that the
best<00:02:34.050> way<00:02:34.319> for<00:02:34.590> us<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.709> solve<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
best way for us to solve it is in a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.330 
best way for us to solve it is in a
comprehensive<00:02:36.090> way<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:37.470> means<00:02:37.770> number<00:02:38.010> one

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
comprehensive way that means number one

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.270 
comprehensive way that means number one
that<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.110> serious<00:02:40.560> border<00:02:40.830> security<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that we have serious border security and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
that we have serious border security and
we<00:02:41.400> want<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.670> work<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:41.850> states<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.420> Arizona

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
we want to work with states like Arizona

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.430 
we want to work with states like Arizona
so<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:44.510> border<00:02:45.510> security<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.989> meaningful

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so that border security is meaningful

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.559 
so that border security is meaningful
number<00:02:46.830> two<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.819> means<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.180> we're<00:02:48.420> going

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
number two it means that we're going

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.789 
number two it means that we're going
after<00:02:48.920> employers<00:02:49.920> who<00:02:50.730> are<00:02:51.260> hiring<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.590> then

taking advantage of and exploiting
undocumented<00:02:55.650> workers<00:02:56.190> which<00:02:56.489> happens<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.940> lot

to take advantage of them we've got to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.229 
to take advantage of them we've got to
