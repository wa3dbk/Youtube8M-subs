 for 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.510
 the curve does not comment 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.910
 it was therefore necessary to create a 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.889
 Francois Hollande 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.280

 crest suez automatically securing it 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.709

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.299
 it's a dark room in the bins 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.710
