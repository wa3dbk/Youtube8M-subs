00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hey what's up got a critter video for

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.900 
hey what's up got a critter video for
you<00:00:03.799> raking<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.009> yard<00:00:05.040> out<00:00:05.430> here<00:00:05.730> and

you raking the yard out here and
sometimes<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.319> uncover<00:00:08.130> wildlife<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:09.300> let's

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
sometimes you uncover wildlife so let's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.289 
sometimes you uncover wildlife so let's
take<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> look<00:00:13.610> these<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.790> called<00:00:14.969> Brown

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
take a look these are called Brown

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.470 
take a look these are called Brown
snakes<00:00:16.670> also<00:00:17.670> called<00:00:18.090> decays<00:00:18.630> Brown<00:00:18.930> snake

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
snakes also called decays Brown snake

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.220 
snakes also called decays Brown snake
they<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.750> stir<00:00:22.260> area<00:00:22.590> decay<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
they are stir area decay I is the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.429 
they are stir area decay I is the
scientific<00:00:25.230> name<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:26.840> these<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:28.050> small

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
scientific name for them these are small

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
scientific name for them these are small
and<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:29.010> live<00:00:29.220> under<00:00:29.460> compost<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> under

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and they live under compost and under

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.069 
and they live under compost and under
leaves<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:32.600> guess<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> makes<00:00:33.989> sense

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
leaves which I guess that makes sense

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
leaves which I guess that makes sense
we're<00:00:34.800> raking<00:00:34.980> leaves<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.550> uncovered<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> bunch

we're raking leaves we uncovered a bunch
of<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.280> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.760> usually

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
of them but this is what they usually

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240 
of them but this is what they usually
look<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.300> they're<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> smallest<00:00:40.739> species

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
look like they're the smallest species

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
look like they're the smallest species
of<00:00:41.610> snake<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> United<00:00:42.180> States<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.350> usually

of snake in the United States we usually

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.350 
of snake in the United States we usually
don't<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:44.010> more<00:00:44.190> than<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> foot<00:00:44.879> long<00:00:44.910> if

five of these things and interesting
thing<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.729> these<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> variation<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
thing about these is the variation in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
thing about these is the variation in
color<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.250> find<00:01:20.570> notice<00:01:21.570> this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
color that you can find notice this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.980 
color that you can find notice this
one's<00:01:21.900> kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> tan<00:01:22.759> color<00:01:23.759> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> kind

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
one's kind of a tan color which is kind

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
one's kind of a tan color which is kind
of<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> plain<00:01:25.320> brown<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.700> them

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of a plain brown but you get them

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
of a plain brown but you get them
sometimes<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.960> some

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
sometimes that are you not only get some

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.420 
sometimes that are you not only get some
that<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.710> active<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that are a little more active and a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270 
that are a little more active and a
little<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:33.710> hard<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.920> handle

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
little more hard to handle

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.640 
little more hard to handle
this<00:01:37.090> guy's<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> little<00:01:37.570> turd<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.229> we're<00:01:38.560> gonna

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
this guy's a little turd but we're gonna

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.990 
this guy's a little turd but we're gonna
get<00:01:38.830> him<00:01:38.979> anyway<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.549> can<00:01:39.729> see<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
get him anyway so you can see the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.390 
get him anyway so you can see the
difference<00:01:40.830> in<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.979> color<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:43.479> species<00:01:44.400> mr.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
difference in the color same species mr.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.789 
difference in the color same species mr.
area<00:01:45.700> decay<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.840> one<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.350> can<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:50.680> is

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
area decay I but this one you can see is

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.940 
area decay I but this one you can see is
more<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.220> more<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.759> rusty<00:01:52.180> color<00:01:52.950> that's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
more of a more of a rusty color that's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.280 
more of a more of a rusty color that's
kind<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.220> a<00:01:54.310> reddish<00:01:54.700> color<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:55.840> whereas

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
kind of a reddish color to it whereas

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.870 
kind of a reddish color to it whereas
the<00:01:57.159> other<00:01:57.340> one<00:01:57.520> didn't<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:59.340> just<00:02:00.340> variants

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the other one didn't but just variants

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.190 
the other one didn't but just variants
in<00:02:00.970> color<00:02:01.210> this<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> really<00:02:02.320> pretty<00:02:02.500> one<00:02:04.200> but

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
in color this is a really pretty one but

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.899 
in color this is a really pretty one but
just<00:02:06.100> thought<00:02:06.250> you'd<00:02:06.490> find<00:02:06.670> these

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
just thought you'd find these

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.469 
just thought you'd find these
interesting<00:02:07.420> um<00:02:08.429> we're<00:02:09.429> gonna<00:02:09.519> just<00:02:09.880> put<00:02:10.360> them

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
interesting um we're gonna just put them

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.360 
interesting um we're gonna just put them
back<00:02:10.660> when<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.050> get<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.350> compost<00:02:11.860> back<00:02:12.130> where

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
back when we get the compost back where

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.170 
back when we get the compost back where
we<00:02:12.519> want<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:15.310> turn<00:02:15.489> them<00:02:15.610> loose<00:02:15.760> back<00:02:16.030> in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
we want it just turn them loose back in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000 
we want it just turn them loose back in
the<00:02:16.269> yard<00:02:16.480> let<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.500> let<00:02:17.590> them<00:02:17.830> do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the yard let them you know let them do

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.860 
the yard let them you know let them do
what<00:02:18.160> they<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.489> they're<00:02:19.360> pretty<00:02:19.630> common

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
what they will they're pretty common

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.890 
what they will they're pretty common
around<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:21.000> although<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.209> don't<00:02:22.480> see<00:02:22.630> them

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
around here although you don't see them
