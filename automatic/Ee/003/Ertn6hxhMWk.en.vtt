rims and these are bent in the shape

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.370 
rims and these are bent in the shape
using<00:00:56.860> the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
using the

enemies and after the rips are bent that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.680 
enemies and after the rips are bent that
will<00:01:07.590> work<00:01:07.800> on<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.400> call<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> top<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
will work on what I call the top and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.289 
will work on what I call the top and
that<00:01:10.760> made<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> difference

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
that made a difference

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
and that made quite fit only a couple of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.080 
and that made quite fit only a couple of
millimeters<00:01:36.290> thin<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> top<00:01:37.820> maybe

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
millimeters thin for the top maybe

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.540 
millimeters thin for the top maybe
slightly<00:01:38.630> thicker<00:01:38.900> for<00:01:39.170> their<00:01:39.290> back<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:40.430> that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
slightly thicker for their back so that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.820 
slightly thicker for their back so that
they<00:01:40.640> biker<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.780> trick<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.230> if<00:01:42.620> you're

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
they biker now the trick is if you're

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.740 
they biker now the trick is if you're
making<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.370> Stradivari<00:01:44.000> model<00:01:44.480> let's<00:01:44.600> say

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
making a Stradivari model let's say

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.360 
making a Stradivari model let's say
you're<00:01:44.900> trying<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> do<00:01:45.290> all<00:01:45.500> these<00:01:45.710> things<00:01:45.770> in

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
you're trying to do all these things in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.600 
you're trying to do all these things in
the<00:01:46.490> style<00:01:46.900> Stradivari

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the style Stradivari

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.250 
the style Stradivari
Guarnere<00:01:49.360> good<00:01:49.810> things<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.170> little

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
Guarnere good things a little

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260 
Guarnere good things a little
differently<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.010> you're<00:01:51.250> also<00:01:51.370> thinking<00:01:51.730> of

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
differently so you're also thinking of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.710 
differently so you're also thinking of
what<00:01:53.020> Master<00:01:53.680> maker<00:01:54.010> of<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.120> golden<00:01:55.480> period

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
what Master maker of the golden period

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.930 
what Master maker of the golden period
in<00:01:55.930> cremona<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.770> 1769

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
in cremona of 1769

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.230 
in cremona of 1769
might've<00:01:59.660> done

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.770 

and<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.659> course<00:02:02.840> there's<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.170> varnish<00:02:03.640> which

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
and of course there's the varnish which

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780 
and of course there's the varnish which
protects<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> wood<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.369> improves<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.580> sound

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
protects the wood and improves the sound

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.440 
protects the wood and improves the sound
also

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
also

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.970 
also
we<00:02:09.959> use<00:02:10.110> traditional<00:02:10.709> recipes

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
we use traditional recipes

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.960 
we use traditional recipes
and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.640> putting<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.540> strings

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.020 

I<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:17.810> every<00:02:18.440> aspect<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.520> violin

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I think every aspect of the violin

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
I think every aspect of the violin
making<00:02:20.470> requires<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.530> lot<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.770> patience<00:02:23.050> many

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
making requires a lot of patience many

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.870 
making requires a lot of patience many
things<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:24.560> about<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.980> once<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.550> if<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
things to think about it once and if you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.120 
things to think about it once and if you
remove<00:02:26.840> some<00:02:27.080> wood<00:02:27.230> from<00:02:27.440> one<00:02:27.590> part<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.980> might

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
