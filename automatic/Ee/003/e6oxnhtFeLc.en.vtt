00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
can reverse an animation or any video

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.740 
can reverse an animation or any video
for<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.250> matter<00:00:08.429> inside<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> blender<00:00:09.630> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
for that matter inside a blender and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.940 
for that matter inside a blender and
about<00:00:10.380> three<00:00:10.860> klicks<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:12.440> blender<00:00:13.440> has<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
about three klicks so blender has the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.640 
about three klicks so blender has the
video<00:00:14.070> sequence<00:00:14.580> editor<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> little<00:00:15.650> kind

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
video sequence editor it's a little kind

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.429 
video sequence editor it's a little kind
of<00:00:16.740> very<00:00:17.490> simple<00:00:17.940> video<00:00:18.690> editor<00:00:19.109> inside<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
of very simple video editor inside a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.290 
of very simple video editor inside a
blender<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.130> go<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> video<00:00:20.730> editing<00:00:20.910> up

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
blender so if you go to video editing up

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.349 
blender so if you go to video editing up
here<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
here you can then see that we have a

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.900 
here you can then see that we have a
sequencer<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:25.859> F<00:00:25.949> curve<00:00:26.160> editor<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.789> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sequencer have an F curve editor and we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.839 
sequencer have an F curve editor and we
have<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.689> view<00:00:27.990> our<00:00:28.019> footage<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.699> i

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
have where we view our footage so if i

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.889 
have where we view our footage so if i
were<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.660> frame<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.289> add<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.000> movie<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
were to at frame one add in a movie and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
animation that i made you can see if i

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.369 
animation that i made you can see if i
play<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:44.629> it's<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.899> normal<00:00:47.300> okay<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.660> say<00:00:49.110> i

play it it's just normal okay but say i
wanted<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> reverse<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:51.379> well<00:00:52.379> basically

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
wanted to reverse this well basically

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.939 
wanted to reverse this well basically
all<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.649> over<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.860> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
button just that says backwards and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.080 
button just that says backwards and
basically<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
have now a reversed image or worst movie

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
have now a reversed image or worst movie
um<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:12.200> now<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.340> just

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
um and now all you have to do is just

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
um and now all you have to do is just
know<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> dimensions<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.100> original

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
know the dimensions of your original

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.070 
know the dimensions of your original
video<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> believe<00:01:18.000> mine<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.530> 720p<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.560> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
video I believe mine was 720p or so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.710 
video I believe mine was 720p or so
delete<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.290> cube<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.930> change<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.549> 720p

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
delete your cube and change this to 720p

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
delete your cube and change this to 720p
and<00:01:28.759> if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> render<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> image<00:01:30.590> you'll<00:01:31.590> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and if you render the image you'll see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.929 
and if you render the image you'll see
that<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.400> image<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.290> frame<00:01:34.290> one

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
that you have your image and a frame one

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.960 
that you have your image and a frame one
yeah<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.119> starts<00:01:36.570> reversed<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> then<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
yeah it starts reversed so then you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
yeah it starts reversed so then you
could<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.329> ahead<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.540> click<00:01:39.869> render

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
could just go ahead and click render

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
could just go ahead and click render
Animation<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:42.360> image<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.320> be

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Animation and your image would then be

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.969 
Animation and your image would then be
saved<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> did<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> movie<00:01:45.570> format<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.229> could

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
saved if you did a movie format I could

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.300 
saved if you did a movie format I could
be<00:01:47.070> saved<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:48.659> reverse<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:50.009> tool<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
be saved in reverse and what tool is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
be saved in reverse and what tool is
that<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.820> work<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.270> any<00:01:51.540> video<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that this can work with any video you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.219 
that this can work with any video you
make<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't<00:01:53.460> even<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.079> an

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
make it doesn't even have to be an

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.609 
make it doesn't even have to be an
animation<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.310> video<00:01:56.670> or<00:01:57.229> an<00:01:58.229> image

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
animation it can be a video or an image

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.830 
animation it can be a video or an image
sequence<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.280> anything<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.060> yeah
