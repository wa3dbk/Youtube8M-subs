filter<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> toy<00:00:05.819> or<00:00:06.120> Hilux<00:00:06.629> mark<00:00:06.990> six<00:00:07.410> this

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
filter on a toy or Hilux mark six this

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.430 
filter on a toy or Hilux mark six this
is<00:00:07.740> acting<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.189> V<00:00:08.400> go<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.849> import<00:00:09.269> model<00:00:09.630> okay

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
is acting a V go the import model okay

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.650 
is acting a V go the import model okay
so<00:00:10.500> basically<00:00:10.980> here's<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.700> fuel<00:00:12.000> finish<00:00:12.450> back

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so basically here's the fuel finish back

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.480 
so basically here's the fuel finish back
out<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.139> can<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.440> where<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
out of it you can see where it is in the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
out of it you can see where it is in the
engine<00:00:15.000> base<00:00:15.210> was<00:00:15.420> next<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.839> battery<00:00:16.289> so

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
engine base was next to the battery so

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.099 
engine base was next to the battery so
there's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.190> ring<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.810> need<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
there's a ring here that you need to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
there's a ring here that you need to
undo<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.520> undo<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.090> ring<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.600> like

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
undo so if you undo that ring there like

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.589 
undo so if you undo that ring there like
I'm<00:00:22.170> doing<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:25.279> that<00:00:26.279> drops<00:00:26.609> down<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.119> then

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
I'm doing that that drops down and then

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
I'm doing that that drops down and then
you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.930> lift<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> top<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.519> need<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you can lift the top off so you need to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.189 
you can lift the top off so you need to
wiggle<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.359> bit<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
wiggle it a little bit and then that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.040 
wiggle it a little bit and then that
lifts<00:00:31.740> off<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> diesel<00:00:32.640> could<00:00:33.480> spill<00:00:33.840> out

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
lifts off the diesel could spill out

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.440 
lifts off the diesel could spill out
okay<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.059> side

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
okay you can put that then to one side

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450 
okay you can put that then to one side
now<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.170> should<00:00:37.410> take<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> should

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
now we should take this out this should

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
now we should take this out this should
be<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> fuel<00:00:39.059> filler<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.050> there's<00:00:40.260> two

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
be the fuel filler here now there's two

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.170 
be the fuel filler here now there's two
o-rings<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> watch<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.969> see

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
o-rings we need to watch one is out see

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.319 
o-rings we need to watch one is out see
on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> plastic<00:00:42.989> housing<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.300> take<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
on the plastic housing there take that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.170 
on the plastic housing there take that
out<00:00:45.719> okay<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
these are the new parts so that's the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.440 
these are the new parts so that's the
new<00:01:06.130> one<00:01:06.370> there<00:01:06.730> okay

spin that ring back ribs okay so with
the<00:01:50.670> ring<00:01:51.000> tight<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.200> need<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.440> do<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the ring tight now you need to do is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.460 
the ring tight now you need to do is
just<00:01:52.830> prime<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.570> push<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> top<00:01:55.260> bit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
just prime so you can push this top bit

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.280 
just prime so you can push this top bit
climb<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.610> should<00:01:59.880> pump<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.720> diesel<00:02:01.110> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
climb it that should pump the diesel in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.140 
climb it that should pump the diesel in
and<00:02:02.250> clear<00:02:02.990> clear<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> air<00:02:04.260> block<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.680> down

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
and clear clear the air block it down

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.700 
and clear clear the air block it down
you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.330> feel<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:06.990> Hardy<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.560> that's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
you can feel it get Hardy and that's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
you can feel it get Hardy and that's
gone<00:02:07.890> solid<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:08.820> pumped<00:02:09.180> all<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gone solid now so that's pumped all the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.740
