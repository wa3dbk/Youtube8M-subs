00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
just to see how long it's going to take

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.130 
just to see how long it's going to take
for<00:03:06.600> an<00:03:06.870> account<00:03:07.380> starting<00:03:08.160> at<00:03:08.250> level<00:03:08.790> 1<00:03:09.210> to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
for an account starting at level 1 to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.010 
for an account starting at level 1 to
get<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> way<00:03:10.620> maxed<00:03:11.100> really<00:03:11.880> all<00:03:12.360> 99

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020

attack<00:03:14.180> strength<00:03:15.180> defense<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.380> then

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
attack strength defense and then

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.070 
attack strength defense and then
probably<00:03:17.190> range<00:03:17.520> afterwards<00:03:17.880> seeing<00:03:18.840> if

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
probably range afterwards seeing if

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.920 
probably range afterwards seeing if
nitro<00:03:19.680> zone<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.040> even<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.750> game

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
nitro zone is even like in the game

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.030 
nitro zone is even like in the game
after<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.860> point<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:24.530> yeah<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.740> should<00:03:25.920> look

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
after that point so yeah we should look

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.270 
after that point so yeah we should look
forward<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.610> um<00:03:27.680> see<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.800> beer<00:03:29.040> pay

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.550 
forward to that um see how the beer pay
screws<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.300> amount<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.570> time<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.290> i'll

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
screws in that amount of time and i'll

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.870
