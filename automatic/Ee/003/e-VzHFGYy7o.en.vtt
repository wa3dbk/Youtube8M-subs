00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
pocket it is very small so I guess I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.560 
pocket it is very small so I guess I
would<00:02:31.590> say<00:02:31.740> it's<00:02:31.890> very<00:02:31.970> travel<00:02:32.970> friendly<00:02:33.360> or

if you have a laptop you like to be on
the<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.630> works<00:02:36.750> great<00:02:37.020> for<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.530> can

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the go it works great for that you can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040 
the go it works great for that you can
just<00:02:37.830> mount<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.220> top<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.490> laptop<00:02:39.050> it

just mount it on top of the laptop it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.330 
just mount it on top of the laptop it
even<00:02:40.260> works<00:02:40.410> good<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> desktop

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.520 
even works good if you have a desktop
like<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> couple<00:02:42.810> monitors<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.350> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
like I do with a couple monitors this is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
like I do with a couple monitors this is
right<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.980> top<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.360> sounds

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510

of<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.690> top<00:02:49.260> notch<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.770> how<00:02:49.860> small<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
of it is a top notch for how small it is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520
