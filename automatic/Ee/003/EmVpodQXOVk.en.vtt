00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi all had the room in this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.430
 video i will introduce you to my color 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.140
 crew then you are a lot to have 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.389
 asked what color I had chosen 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800
 so rather than responding to each 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.000
 every time I commented 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.340
 I was going to make a video like this 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 everyone is aware of a sudden 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.260
 so my color crew should know that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.840
 I choose them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.820
 when I started I was online so he 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.619
 so it will be a year and a half soon 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.970
 that I chose this color and I 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.830
 still not changed why I'm not going 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.199
 change because I really chose them 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.189
 carefully I like red 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.910
 I like red and I do not like red 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.130
 dark 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.469
 so I really wanted to take something 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.820
 who stands out well who slam and I 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.899
 find that I chose a good color 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 since anyway me I them 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.070
 guarded since all this time it's not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 for nothing and if there are any 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 ask for the color that's so I 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.160
 think it's not for nothing either 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 it's pretty pretty so 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.699
 I give you the color codes because 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 that it's a special color that you 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.530
 can not the hall to put directly 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.690
 in the custom ls you have to customize it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.730
 but by putting the color code on the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.939
 social club site 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.810
 then the color code is hashtag eb 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.080
 26 26 so that's the color code and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.909
 to have it you put r2 135g 38b 38 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 so that's to get the color 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.540
 to get it easier you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 just put the cursor on the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.439
 red but all the way up and then you 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.049
 move up to fall on it's 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.509
 simple enough to do so here is this 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.430
 that it gives on a desire after you 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.659
 can put it on other vehicles 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 I 'll show you a little bit about it 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.920
 look at the time I think it's 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.360
 where it is the prettiest apparently 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.299
 I have to turn a vehicle where we go 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.250
 to get off the russian then by 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.670
 against me I put it only in color 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.770
 matt 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 when I put it in metallized I find 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.860
 it does not look good in color 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 mate on a titi this is what it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.570
 give so it's the same I found that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 really pretty besides this entity 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.170
 she dates you still see the plate 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.020
 registration the hall so that's 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.920
 really a vehicle that is old 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.840
 which I have kept for a very long time 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.200
 so that's the matte color that's the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.910
 crew color but in metallized so me 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.920
 I love less 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.590
 after maybe there are some who will like but 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.790
 in any case I like less than the matte 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.530
 so that's why I do not put it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.900
 so the jelly put simply for you 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.760
 show but you've never seen me 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.220
 ride with a metallic vehicle 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.050
 crew color that's normal because I 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.090
 find that it does not do it with the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.530
 reflections I find that the red comes out 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.910
 not very well after maybe there is 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.560
 who will like to maintain it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.180
 there are still yellow rims because 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.150
 it's a batman vehicle at the base so 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.350
 they had the Batman colors I had 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.050
 make a video to show you the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.330
 superman and batman colors then on 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.460
 a feldzer on a fender that's what 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 it gives so it's the same 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.940
 I really like the color that it makes 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.480
 and besides you'll see that there 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 also that date since was waiting if 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.870
 I can go on here we have 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.510
 still the license plate the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.930
 room so it's really vehicles 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.870
 that I have for an extremely long time 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.360
 color throwing football is disgusting 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.310
 on the ugliness you've already seen and ben 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.860
 yeah on that one too on the online 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.170
 seems like they're called and nissan 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.560
 key on that one too I put in 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.080
 secondary colors crew colors so 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.959
 that's what it gives I like rather not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.170
 badly then I like the matte color 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.860
 but not on any vehicle not 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.480
 no matter how 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.550
 really need the colors and the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.020
 special care and when it's special I 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.540
 think it's nice in math after 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.459
 I know there are some who prefer the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.810
 metallic 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.180
 but after that everything depends on 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.060
 colors we choose in others 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.400
 garages I do not know if I chose 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.810
 cros colors in vehicle but in all 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.970
 case I give you the code anyway 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.750
 for you to be sure to have it that's 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.300
 hashtag eb 26 26 and for having it you 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.650
 put air of 135g 38b 38 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.840
 there I will still check in the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.980
 second garage after the other garage there 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.050
 a bit far so we will not go 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.000
 in it but anyway I had you 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.610
 already made a video about the garages of 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.260
 the room so you know pretty much what 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.390
 that I have as a vehicle I always 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.070
 not changed I did not clean 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.120
 because a household to do I had said 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.400
 that I will do it besides ben I have 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.900
 added this one this one I like 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.670
 I show it to you in passing so there by 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.620
 against it is a vehicle on which I 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.850
 will not put maths it's really a 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.980
 vehicle on which I would leave 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.919
 metallized because I find it is 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.770
 really class like that with the little 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.930
 los santos custom on the back I find 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.850
 that it's perfect inside it's 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.190
 beautiful short end is the kind of 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.510
 vehicle I like that I would like 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.240
 not often but I still like it 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.850
 and that's the peyote years and I show you 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.169
 the exact name vappie of peyotl the same 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.570
 asked me a comment where to find this 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.510
 vehicle I found them in the gang 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.250
 of Balasse then after maybe he 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.210
 is available elsewhere also to mount 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.220
 because I found in the gang of 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.930
 sweep then we will ask the question 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.940
 to know where the gang of Balasse 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.580
 so I'm going to show you on the map where 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.860
 is the gang of sweep he is he 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.110
 and it is of human time can not crush 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.940
 at the end of this street he is here so here 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.310
 this is where you find all the 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.120
 the bmx of colors besides here you 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.160
 have the skate park 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.200
 so there is every color bmx 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.090
 and when you go down the street there is a 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.620
 impasse elsewhere here is at it's 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.350
 the franklin garage in the mode 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.400
 story alas at the end of this street so 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.940
 just there that's where I found so 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.800
 two pilots 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.060
 she was parked so just 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.040
 just from the fly after good there is 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.900
 the balansun so be careful kill 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.280
 where I do not know, but 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.990
 you can also find elsewhere 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.830
 I found them there because they 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.479
 squat all the time in 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.540
 vehicles like that but otherwise you 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.680
 can also find elsewhere 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.440
 so here we come to the end of this 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.460
 video that's all for my crew color so 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.900
 you have other questions in relation to 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.700
 to my color do not hesitate to breaks 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.140
 in comment that's all for this 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.350
 video and I tell you everything at 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.979
 time 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.979
 ciao
