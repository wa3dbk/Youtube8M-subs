science which is in the BlackBerry and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
science which is in the BlackBerry and
that<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> dark<00:01:01.379> color<00:01:01.680> helps

memory retention and these will kick

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.520 
memory retention and these will kick
free<00:01:07.470> radicals<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.540> absolutely<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:10.350> just

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
free radicals but I absolutely I'm just

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
free radicals but I absolutely I'm just
