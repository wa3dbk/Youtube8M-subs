00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.360 

here's<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.179> consideration<00:00:03.840> for<00:00:04.440> an

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
here's a consideration for an

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.460 
here's a consideration for an
alternative<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.240> using<00:00:06.420> an<00:00:06.690> emergency<00:00:07.230> brake

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
alternative to using an emergency brake

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.240 
alternative to using an emergency brake
handle<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.940> emergency<00:00:09.929> brake<00:00:10.170> callipers<00:00:10.769> get

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
handle the emergency brake callipers get

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.230 
handle the emergency brake callipers get
up<00:00:11.370> get<00:00:11.940> set<00:00:12.210> up<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> same<00:00:12.719> way<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:14.240> they're

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
up get set up the same way as they're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.220 
up get set up the same way as they're
intended<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:16.880> but<00:00:17.880> instead<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.330> using<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
intended to be but instead of using a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.820 
intended to be but instead of using a
handle<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.369> mechanical<00:00:21.300> handle<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:22.650> been

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
handle a mechanical handle I've been

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.900 
handle a mechanical handle I've been
using<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.430> system<00:00:23.670> called<00:00:24.119> East<00:00:24.449> op<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
using this system called East op and it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480 
using this system called East op and it
has<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.240> actuator<00:00:27.660> which<00:00:28.080> mounts<00:00:28.500> beautifully

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
has an actuator which mounts beautifully

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.979 
has an actuator which mounts beautifully
along<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.720> driver's<00:00:31.199> side<00:00:31.610> frame<00:00:32.989> four

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
along the the driver's side frame four

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.920 
along the the driver's side frame four
bolts<00:00:34.350> hold<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.719> there's<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
bolts hold it in there it's there's the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
bolts hold it in there it's there's the
East<00:00:37.140> stop<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.739> upside<00:00:38.489> down<00:00:38.520> according<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
East stop it's upside down according to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
East stop it's upside down according to
that<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.230> doesn't<00:00:40.559> matter<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.190> hooks

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that it doesn't matter and then it hooks

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
that it doesn't matter and then it hooks
into<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:44.270> low<00:00:45.270> car<00:00:45.570> cables<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> come<00:00:46.530> with

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
into the low car cables that come with

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.760 
into the low car cables that come with
the<00:00:46.770> kit<00:00:47.030> using<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> same<00:00:48.390> block<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.559> only

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the kit using the same block the only

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
the kit using the same block the only
difference<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:51.360> block<00:00:51.660> doesn't<00:00:52.140> hook

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
difference is this block doesn't hook

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.310 
difference is this block doesn't hook
into<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.829> emergency<00:00:53.370> brake<00:00:53.660> handle<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.140> just

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
into the emergency brake handle it just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160 
into the emergency brake handle it just
hooks<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.219> cable<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.940> coming<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
hooks into the cable and coming out of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.639 
hooks into the cable and coming out of
the<00:00:58.260> East<00:00:58.469> stop<00:00:58.739> actuator<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> e<00:01:01.109> stop<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the East stop actuator and the e stop is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.260 
the East stop actuator and the e stop is
wired<00:01:01.949> power<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.300> its<00:01:04.260> own<00:01:04.470> control<00:01:04.860> box<00:01:05.270> which

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
wired power to its own control box which

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
wired power to its own control box which
automatically<00:01:07.020> controls<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.460> amount<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
automatically controls the amount of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.469 
automatically controls the amount of
pressure<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.890> actuator<00:01:11.400> itself<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
pressure that the the actuator itself is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.260 
pressure that the the actuator itself is
pulling<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.040> 600<00:01:14.549> pounds<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
pulling and that's set at 600 pounds and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.100 
pulling and that's set at 600 pounds and
then<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.299> push<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.509> button<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
then it's just a push of a button and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.950 
then it's just a push of a button and
then<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.320> actuator

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.890 

on<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.350> cables<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.820> long<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.120> you<00:01:31.210> adjust<00:01:31.360> them

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
on the cables as long as you adjust them

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.170 
on the cables as long as you adjust them
evenly<00:01:32.710> tension<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.430> begin<00:01:33.730> with<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.090> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
evenly tension to begin with on the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.110 
evenly tension to begin with on the
block's<00:01:34.450> pulls<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.530> back<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.860> 600<00:01:36.400> pounds<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
block's pulls it back to 600 pounds and

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.310 
block's pulls it back to 600 pounds and
so<00:01:37.990> now<00:01:38.170> both<00:01:38.470> calipers<00:01:39.660> are<00:01:40.660> completely

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
so now both calipers are completely

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.560 
so now both calipers are completely
locked<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.440> system<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:45.570> powered

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
locked and when the system is powered

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.240 
locked and when the system is powered
and<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.500> green<00:01:47.740> light<00:01:47.950> will<00:01:48.130> glow

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and it's on the green light will glow

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.650 
and it's on the green light will glow
when<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.280> system<00:01:51.700> isn't<00:01:51.880> powered<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.540> this

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
when the system isn't powered and this

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.010 
when the system isn't powered and this
is<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.110> temporary<00:01:53.470> battery<00:01:54.040> here<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
is just a temporary battery here the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.740 
is just a temporary battery here the
light<00:01:56.260> will<00:01:56.650> go<00:01:56.770> out<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:00.759> also<00:02:01.090> then<00:02:01.540> now

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
light will go out but then also then now

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.740 
light will go out but then also then now
to<00:02:01.810> release<00:02:02.290> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to release it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.540 
to release it
push<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.899> button<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:10.050> pulls<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.230> back<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
push the button as it pulls it back and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.460 
push the button as it pulls it back and
now<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.760> calipers<00:02:13.680> move<00:02:14.680> freely<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:17.230> nice

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
now the calipers move freely it's nice

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.860 
now the calipers move freely it's nice
to<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.190> also<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.610> gradual<00:02:19.390> pull<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
to because it's also a gradual pull it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
to because it's also a gradual pull it
doesn't<00:02:20.320> auto<00:02:20.470> instantly<00:02:21.250> lock<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.060> if

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
doesn't auto instantly lock it so if

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.570 
doesn't auto instantly lock it so if
you're<00:02:22.300> using<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.900> as<00:02:23.080> an<00:02:23.770> emergency<00:02:23.980> brake

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
you're using it as an emergency brake

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.850 
you're using it as an emergency brake
and<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.720> know<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.080> some<00:02:26.290> reason<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.770> had

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and you you know for some reason you had

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.710 
and you you know for some reason you had
a<00:02:26.890> catastrophic<00:02:27.310> brake<00:02:27.970> failure<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.600> had

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
a catastrophic brake failure and had

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.880 
a catastrophic brake failure and had
don't<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.050> brakes<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.560> push<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
don't have brakes you can push the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.420 
don't have brakes you can push the
buttons<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:31.570> will<00:02:31.690> gradually<00:02:32.160> slow<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
buttons and it will gradually slow the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.920 
buttons and it will gradually slow the
vehicle<00:02:33.610> down<00:02:33.850> I<00:02:34.390> mean<00:02:34.690> 2<00:02:35.019> or<00:02:35.140> 3<00:02:35.350> seconds<00:02:35.830> worth

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
vehicle down I mean 2 or 3 seconds worth

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.539 
vehicle down I mean 2 or 3 seconds worth
so<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.110> system<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.560> almost<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.340> it

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
so this system is almost it's like it

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.180 
so this system is almost it's like it
was<00:02:39.640> built<00:02:39.880> for<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.150> SLC<00:02:40.810> right<00:02:41.799> along<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
was built for the SLC right along the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.500 
was built for the SLC right along the
frame<00:02:42.459> because<00:02:42.760> there's<00:02:43.000> plenty<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.360> room

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
frame because there's plenty of room

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.780 
frame because there's plenty of room
there<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.860> got<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> watch<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.580> there's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
there you just got to watch that there's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
there you just got to watch that there's
not<00:02:45.940> any<00:02:46.000> tight<00:02:46.959> corners<00:02:48.510> can't<00:02:49.510> avoid<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
not any tight corners can't avoid that

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.310 
not any tight corners can't avoid that
completely<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:52.030> way<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.239> has<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.959> cable

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
completely the way it has to the cable

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.780 
completely the way it has to the cable
runs<00:02:54.239> here<00:02:55.239> on<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.170> control<00:02:56.320> arm<00:02:56.640> because<00:02:57.640> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
runs here on the control arm because it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.580 
runs here on the control arm because it
has<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.180> go<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.329> top<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.870> control<00:02:59.230> arm<00:02:59.260> if

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
has to go on top of the control arm if

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.140 
has to go on top of the control arm if
it<00:02:59.709> goes<00:02:59.829> underneath<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.640> wants<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.910> rub

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
it goes underneath and it wants to rub

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.890 
it goes underneath and it wants to rub
on<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.420> tire<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.880> not<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.630> know<00:03:04.720> it's

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
on the tire but it's not you know it's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.490 
on the tire but it's not you know it's
still<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.829> gradual<00:03:06.760> bend<00:03:07.060> there<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.320> most

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
still a gradual bend there for the most

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.250 
still a gradual bend there for the most
part<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.280> ends<00:03:09.549> up<00:03:09.670> not<00:03:10.450> kinking<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.140> it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
part and it ends up not kinking and it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.610 
part and it ends up not kinking and it
works<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.670> system's<00:03:13.090> nice<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:17.440> works

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
works and the system's nice so it works

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.050 
works and the system's nice so it works
out<00:03:17.829> well<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:19.660> car<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.019> getting<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.829> LS<00:03:21.760> 9
