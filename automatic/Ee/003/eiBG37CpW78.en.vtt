getting<00:02:49.380> ready<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.800> 2012<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.820> liked<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
getting ready for 2012 I liked the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.880 
getting ready for 2012 I liked the
format<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.780> lot<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.260> people<00:02:52.500> talked

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
format a lot and I think people talked

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.500 
format a lot and I think people talked
about<00:02:53.160> oh<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.460> ten<00:02:53.670> laps<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.090> don't<00:02:54.270> need<00:02:54.390> as

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
about oh it's ten laps you don't need as

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.780 
about oh it's ten laps you don't need as
much<00:02:54.770> endurance<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.130> don't<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.520> have<00:02:56.730> to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
much endurance you don't really have to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.100 
much endurance you don't really have to
be<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.180> good<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> shape<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.780> was<00:02:57.870> 10<00:02:58.080> laps

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
be in as good a shape but it was 10 laps

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.890 
be in as good a shape but it was 10 laps
minute<00:02:58.710> 30<00:02:58.980> lap<00:02:59.190> times<00:02:59.490> more<00:02:59.730> or<00:02:59.880> less<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.240> you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
minute 30 lap times more or less and you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.270 
minute 30 lap times more or less and you
had<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.260> go<00:03:01.350> back<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.800> only<00:03:01.890> had<00:03:02.010> 15

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
had to go back and you only had 15

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.470 
had to go back and you only had 15
minutes<00:03:02.310> between<00:03:02.640> Moto's<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.300> what<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
minutes between Moto's that's what I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.910 
minutes between Moto's that's what I
think<00:03:03.720> made<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.990> really<00:03:04.320> interesting<00:03:04.530> was

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
think made it really interesting was

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.500 
think made it really interesting was
that<00:03:04.950> format<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.640> how<00:03:05.700> those<00:03:05.820> guys<00:03:06.060> cope<00:03:06.330> with

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
that format and how those guys cope with

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.360 
that format and how those guys cope with
it<00:03:06.540> well<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.140> here's<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> other<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:07.650> you'd

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it well and here's the other thing you'd

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.610 
it well and here's the other thing you'd
mentioned<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> physical<00:03:09.630> aspect<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
mentioned the physical aspect of it I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.530 
mentioned the physical aspect of it I
was<00:03:10.800> thinking<00:03:11.430> about<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.760> mental<00:03:12.030> aspect<00:03:12.420> I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
was thinking about the mental aspect I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.880 
was thinking about the mental aspect I
mean<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:12.990> hard<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.320> get<00:03:13.500> yourself

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
mean it's so hard to get yourself

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.890 
mean it's so hard to get yourself
motivated<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.940> main<00:03:15.120> event<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.810> they

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
motivated for that main event but they

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.420 
motivated for that main event but they
had<00:03:15.990> three<00:03:16.320> of<00:03:16.470> them<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.770> they<00:03:16.890> only<00:03:17.010> had<00:03:17.190> ten

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
had three of them and they only had ten

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.340 
had three of them and they only had ten
minutes<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.850> between<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.870> ready<00:03:19.050> for

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

about it well Villopoto was an

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.730 
about it well Villopoto was an
interesting<00:03:30.570> choice<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.140> he<00:03:31.290> made<00:03:31.320> he

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
interesting choice that he made he

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.950 
interesting choice that he made he
stayed<00:03:32.100> between<00:03:32.370> Moto's<00:03:32.700> two<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.210> three<00:03:33.450> his

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
stayed between Moto's two and three his

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.780 
stayed between Moto's two and three his
bike<00:03:34.230> went<00:03:34.470> back<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.890> trailer<00:03:35.250> he<00:03:35.490> stayed

bike went back to the trailer he stayed
down<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.150> waited<00:03:36.630> between<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.050> race<00:03:37.230> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
down and waited between the race I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.420 
down and waited between the race I
thought<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.800> an<00:03:37.890> interesting<00:03:37.950> choice

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
thought that was an interesting choice

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.980 
thought that was an interesting choice
perhaps<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.000> stay<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.450> mayhem<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
perhaps to stay out of the mayhem of the

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.870 
perhaps to stay out of the mayhem of the
pits<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:41.040> he<00:03:41.130> saw<00:03:41.280> him<00:03:41.370> come<00:03:41.520> back<00:03:41.670> out
