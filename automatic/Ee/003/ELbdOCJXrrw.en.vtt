00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.060
 the Lötschberg base tunnel 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 an important element of the European high-speed network 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.200
 Starting in 2007, more than one hundred trains will travel here each day for up to 250 kilometers 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.960
 earn per hour 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 an immense burden on the road 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.200
 the optimal solution for this is solid anchoring 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 Only a few companies have specialized in cultivation 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 we belong to it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 The name Rhomberg stands for customized solutions in track construction 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.610
 and fixed carriageway Ettwein major projects in Germany 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.140
 Austria and Switzerland 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.520
 the requirements are high, the road surface had to be extreme 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 Wear safely withstand 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.720
 just need little maintenance and especially Kirk be durable 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.060
 50 years guaranteed service life that is the default 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.510
 the special thing about these systems the thresholds are not in a loose 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.630
 Ballast bed but are firmly poured into concrete 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.880
 2 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 Experience and expertise were even more important 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.050
 we were awarded the contract as the contractor for that but was going on 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.800
 on 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.780
 the overall responsibility from planning and projecting to the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 turnkey delivery 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.859
 this includes an investment volume of over 160 million Swiss francs 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:19.290
 over 50 km of solid lane are in the areas of single lane 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.459
 install lötschberg base tunnels 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.899
 under difficult conditions 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.909
 while the shell works are still going on at one end of the tunnel 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.999
 At the other end, our track-builders come into action 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.729
 the schedule is tight, its rich interfaces are to be coordinated 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 the bar for optimal work preparation is high 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.459
 the Lötschberg makes man and machines special 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.089
 challenges 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.349
 the conditions in Berlin 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.599
 There is a climate like in the tropics 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.979
 almost 30 degrees Celsius about 95 percent humidity 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.409
 85 of our employees work here in three shifts around the clock 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.509
 seven days a week 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.299
 One hundred thousand meters 169 thousand seemed to swell one block 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.670
 80 thousand cubic meters of concrete in just one and a half years, we build the 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.669
 complete lane 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.189
 a strong team 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.779
 two single-lane tunnels cross the old one massively 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.749
 Never before has a solid lane been built in such a small space 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.799
 That requires new solutions 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.609
 for logistics and devices 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.609
 Several new developments are being used at Lötschberg 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.239
 designed and constructed by Rhomberg Bahntechnik 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.249
 for example our new like reporting system 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.060
 The building material can only be transported on its way to the narrow stirring 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:23.819
 become 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.509
 over the rail 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.590
 The provisional track must already be passable at full load 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:33.780
 This is exactly what makes Rhomberg's innovation possible for the first time 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.729
 Premiere also for the new Vito paver dead a bio compact and 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.949
 Shares in a train 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.949
 also rather a special production for the Lötschberg base tunnel 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.909
 One hundred meters of new roadway are created day after day 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 the processes interact smoothly 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.419
 A construction and logistics system is exactly coordinated 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.020
 an optimized manufacturing process 2000 feet underground surface 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:32.020
 the construction is one the precision the other high-speed lines 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.240
 demand high tech in surveying 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.030
 our own developments for the measurement stands for exact and 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.030
 economic setting up of the railroad tracks 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.470
 With this technique we guarantee a precise equal Slomka and thus is 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.470
 Safety and ride comfort 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.330
 the track flies with millimeter accuracy 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.240
 ready for the first high-speed trains through the 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.240
 Alps 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.860
 The drivers were also in the Lötschberg base tunnel 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.970
 a technical logistical and human challenge 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.249
 the know-how is with us 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:25.789
