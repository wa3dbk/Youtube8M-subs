00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.990

 year double functions of that double 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.440
 cost will have to be bombs maybe not much 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.750
 particular we also speak of that is the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.280
 personal history the story you have 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 done these are some of the characters 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.520
 who attended 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 the restaurant where they were born 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 fettuccine alfredo that they had way 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.300
 to appreciate when I was born instead 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.090
 the effect there were invented by a 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.670
 sure alfredo happens to be one 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 love story because alfredo had 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.030
 this pregnant wife with the desire to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.060
 white pasta that has been invented 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.110
 these three kitchens simply plant 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 with butter and parmesan 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 from that moment they became 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 as famous as you see when it was born 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 in 1907 the fettuccine were created in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.660
 1925 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.130
 but in 1925 the butter has changed 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:42.300
 slightly law richer we go for 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.399
 make you understand that the goodness of the time but i 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.289
 characters that you had explained to me 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.179
 story I cared about here we have 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.350
 gabriele d'annunzio who left us 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.460
 a resuscitated memory for fettuccine 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 even exact but he also wrote 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.939
 argue about him 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.799
 very often also left many 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.229
 memories of his past 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.740

 the Roman interpreter bull was the film yes 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.330
 it's wrong so I was myself 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.760
 wrong because her best friend 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.150
 of identical area in fact all that is 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.110
 practically everyone has tasted the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.450
 multiplicity of characters from 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.970
 culture literature art politics 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.570

 sixties of the dolce vita when 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.239
 turned the film Roman holiday is recognized 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.670
 you are young 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.920
 I play there, but I do exist 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.020
 thank you as though you're cute and I'm sorry 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.510
 speaks but we talk about it because it is 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.300
 chef and then the fettuccine with which 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.630
 that is, you were at home in the house 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.690
 with a very particular draw for 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 have the subtlety of the employed and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.750
 transparent we can even see maybe 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.570
 how we do the processing of these 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.239
 fettuccine too legit in water water salt 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.370
 water and salt and then later we have in the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.660
 our friend to a batch freezer that yes 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.100
 entertains and enjoys turning 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.310
 and true they make me the names reboot the trunk 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.800
 is thrown in salt water sense to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.350
 traditional 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 that is, they do not stick long no no no is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.880
 a passion 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.940
 worked with wheat semolina 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.040
 therefore it is a bit richer 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.870
 here is no flour chef has 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.680
 given the ingredients then let's talk about 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.960
 then purchased butter is good to cassano e 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.460
 butter parmesan parmesan reggiano one 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.020
 aged for 36 months 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.330
 Yup 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.210
 lots of cooking water for kids 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.180
 look look at the workings because 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.620
 is putting all this water because 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.270
 cooking water to avoid 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.360
 put the cream we leave a little 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.600
 fatigue and butter this goes 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.130
 worked very quickly then 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.480
 here we pose a lot 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.460
 parmigiano reggiano over fettuccine 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:32.340
 nicolus excuse me for a second 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:33.140
 exactly norway pleasure to behold 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.190
 his guests 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.390
 my mom but what's special about it 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.280
 this trust 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:43.890
 there is so much love and pain but 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.590
 only famous look at them have passed 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.110
 all the bigger bigger ones to eat 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.760
 the fettuccine we see that there is sadness 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.810
 and what are the photographs or do we see the 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.750
 audrey hepburn 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.130
 then there is that we see almost brizzi ringo 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.860
 starr 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.540
 mom my right to train I didn't have 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.520
 however, seeing pipe cleaners of those who 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:13.080
 they say when it came even if the whole 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.860
 food then taste the master species 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.470
 followed as you then taste too 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:24.920
 what do you say 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:29.230
 here we are, then luca apologizes but one 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.430
 particular thing china to the guest 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:39.320
 the reggina dish is important 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:41.930
 was therefore called excuse why 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.610
 the most important guest is not a bit of 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.500
 healthy both with young to this night 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.780
 best where there is all this as if 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:57.100
 I had accepted the museum because 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.100
 underworld blades 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:12.650
 now 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:15.169
 now the original text they were given 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.789
 to alfredo from douglas fairbanks Emeriti 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:33.560
 colleagues but by transfer to merit a 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:36.020
 this point 0.9 then travels 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:44.360
 it is an honor of douglas fairbanks 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:47.680
 yes but so young he has fallen as well ho 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.080
 since you will tell me exactly 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.410
 honor and merit you must know that in 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.380
 large hotels already had the chef there 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.690
 she cooked the fettuccine she was wearing 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.419
 the batch freezer in this case him 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.789
 it is called a mantecatore because it has one 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.310
 speed because you see it amounts 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.570
 watery put so much Parmesan cheese that 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.370
 they must be exquisite I find 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.750
 actually it's practically a double 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.940
 processing 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.349
 this is fantastic look to do it 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.349
 good material 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.590
 you know what 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:35.220
 originally want but I do it myself 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.350
 the third part of the city thanks to 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.539
 all our guests and compliments 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.539
 really compliments don't bother me
