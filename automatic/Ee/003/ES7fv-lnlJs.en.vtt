00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and I know this is going to fascinate you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 with claudia and we will thank 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.859
 Mary devotees that we are in your key 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.920
 national 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.019
 of apple pie a wonder of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.210
 all look what this picture is a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.670
 beauty 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 very well painted that I love 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.859
 also when you see the step by step it 's so 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 simple that you do what happens is that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 there is that has to flow there is no drawing no 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.640
 there is nothing we are seeing what is going 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.289
 asking really what they will enjoy is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.289
 what you like and we are going to paint 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 well we make a simple design is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 just such a suggested design of a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 jarrita that has flowers that flowers 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 they're not drawn either, let's mark it 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.539
 a little more in case it is not seen and the subject 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 of the flowers because sometimes we 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.289
 they ask how we make flowers without 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.629
 good drawings is like it's a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.059
 trapeze we left there from the trapeze of the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.370
 base of the flower and then only custom-made 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.070
 what are we going to paint we are going to do 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 the trapezium or trapeze flowers or 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.700
 trapeze 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 strokes that will be the petals some 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 down we're going to do another one like that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 Then I have at least three left and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 I close the trapeze and some petal towards 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 down we're going to use watercolor pencils 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 some loose strokes that give me support 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.780
 and give me a table let's say I do not want 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.690
 a table is going to be virtual separation 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.970
 between the wall and the table I'm going to fall 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.190
 palette and mix white titanium and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 yellow from naples what I want 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.070
 achieve is this warm color so that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 to mix it with this green 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 forceful that formerly not what 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.440
 we used never and that is now so 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.990
 fashion and I start painting crossed I go back to 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.810
 the veronesi green palette cerulean blue 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.790
 of course with white and with a little 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.660
 of naples yellow that in warmth 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.460
 is then I go towards the celestial ones 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.110
 obviously when one paints without drawings 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
 without anything like we are doing in this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.660
 moment I decide where the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.640
 light and where will the shadow of 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.149
 this way and about a warm color 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.689
 butter 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.030
 Acrylic I repeat very well prepared and very 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:20.530
 well sealed so that the oil can 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 to smoke easy, darken there towards the 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.470
 outside my zone of light is here and a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 little to the shadows that are I have is 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.379
 in this box towards the outside 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.780
 I continue with the background is very important 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.920
 background worked on the pictures we are going to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.180
 the flowers the flowers are with a brush 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.370
 flat 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.519
 I return to my warm color that is white 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 titanium and yellow of naples and east 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.739
 warm color is going to be the one that's going to 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.250
 clarify the carmine the carmine is a color 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.480
 very strong and very forceful then 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.000
 I go trace downtown center center are 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.329
 Virtual flowers are not any flowers in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.549
 special frames shadows frames shadows 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.379
 I lose them in this fund that 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.970
 it will surely wear green or go to 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.549
 Take white or carry yellow 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.669
 Naples frame shadows frame 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.780
 shadows and I lose lose I lose that is the 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.630
 first step 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.090
 I'm cleaning I'm going to put here in a 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
 Napkin on a cloth did not wash the brush 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.740
 in no time and there I go to the white 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.900
 warm warm white warm white but 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.400
 almost white with a little bit of carmine and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.270
 I begin to highlight 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.489
 I give light I will grab more white still 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.130
 white white white white white 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.500
 clean the brush the truth that mine is 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 in fact all at the same time background 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.739
 design figure all at the same time 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.989
 because the idea was that everything 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.510
 with everything I want to go to the little garritas 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.600
 because otherwise I will not reach the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.959
 time that colors is the same color as 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.810
 the rest of the picture but with the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.040
 nuances that surround me I have a drop of 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.930
 ecological diluent so that I run and I go 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.190
 stretch stretched stretch in some 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.450
 opportunities I put the green of the background 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.270
 on other occasions I put almost white 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.330
 because because I need light I need that 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.389
 have volume 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.870
 almost white I go back to the white that 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.020
 ideal it would be a warm color 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.210
 let's say a butter or more clarito although 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.090
 the butter I return to the yellow of nothing 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.340
 I come back, I come back, it's not good 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.659
 work this being a life style with 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 hard bands 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.419
 the ideal is to work as we are here 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.990
 with the color technique next to color and 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.810
 when he came to this part to not cut 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.139
 a little pink and green I decided to put 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.599
 a little bit more of this color I'm going to 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:02.599
 the palette because it's good that is 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:06.680
 natural shadow the natural shadow is the 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:09.469
 darker brown of the palette of all 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.979
 the paintings still in acrylic still in oil 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:16.430
 and that he has black when I say shadow 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.080
 any color in any medium says 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.379
 shadow means that you have 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.819
 the natural shadow is equal to the sky 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:29.759
 natural with a pinch of black if it is 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:32.219
 we need to reach esfumar 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.620
 pain but just because there is an excess 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.830
 of mold for my taste in painting and not 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.460
 it is necessary to smoke both let's go 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.840
 quickly to another stroke that would be to give 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.939
 depth to the bottom in the background what 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.310
 only that I added apart from what I already 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:55.949
 I have this green that is sap green 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.940
 divine with this one is divine and gives me 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.669
 a virtual support gives me a support that 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.659
 then I'm going to join this fund and some 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.659
 fallen flowers 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:25.389
 what is total light claudia great good 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.310
 yes they have all the pictures of all 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.750
 own and can paint and paint well 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.009
 that between do not miss it 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.009
 until next time
