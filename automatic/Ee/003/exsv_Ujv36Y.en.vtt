so<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.580> gonna<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.940> royal<00:00:18.300> icing<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:19.140> have

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so I'm just gonna use royal icing I have

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.250 
so I'm just gonna use royal icing I have
a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.740> bit<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.130> yellow<00:00:20.520> some<00:00:21.300> brown<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
a little bit of yellow some brown and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.099 
a little bit of yellow some brown and
then<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:23.100> using<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.580> bit<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> red<00:00:24.359> just

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
then I'm using a little bit of red just

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.759 
then I'm using a little bit of red just
in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:26.010> seblak<00:00:26.849> back<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.630> use<00:00:27.869> piping<00:00:28.500> bags

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
in a seblak back you can use piping bags

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.669 
in a seblak back you can use piping bags
but<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.519> find<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.500> bit

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
but I find that this is a little bit

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
but I find that this is a little bit
easier<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.369> because<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.000> throw<00:00:33.210> away<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
easier just because I can throw away the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.700 
easier just because I can throw away the
bags<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:34.110> after<00:00:34.860> then<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.710> really

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
bags right after then I have some really

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340 
bags right after then I have some really
stiff<00:00:38.250> green<00:00:38.640> icing<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.629> piping<00:00:40.050> bag<00:00:40.320> with

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
stiff green icing and a piping bag with

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.520 
stiff green icing and a piping bag with
a<00:00:40.680> leaf<00:00:41.329> tip<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.170> looks<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
a leaf tip and it just looks like this

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:54.060 
a leaf tip and it just looks like this
and<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:47.940> believe<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> magic<00:00:49.649> tip<00:00:49.980> number

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.049 

104<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:56.960> have<00:00:57.320> that<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.520> I<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:58.730> need<00:00:59.030> a

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
104 so I have that and I just need a

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.630 
104 so I have that and I just need a
little<00:00:59.329> bit<00:00:59.660> and<00:01:00.019> then<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:00.980> some<00:01:01.250> cute

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
little bit and then I have some cute

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.200 
little bit and then I have some cute
strawberry<00:01:02.089> cookies<00:01:03.400> so<00:01:04.400> just<00:01:04.699> begin<00:01:05.180> with

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
strawberry cookies so just begin with

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.630 
strawberry cookies so just begin with
I'm<00:01:05.630> just<00:01:05.690> gonna<00:01:06.080> take<00:01:06.350> my<00:01:06.530> red<00:01:06.830> royal<00:01:07.310> icing

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
I'm just gonna take my red royal icing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.249 
I'm just gonna take my red royal icing
and<00:01:08.090> start<00:01:09.310> icing<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.520> top<00:01:10.880> half<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
and start icing the top half of the

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.290 
and start icing the top half of the
strawberry<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.409> outlined<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.430> stem<00:01:16.880> part

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
strawberry so I outlined the stem part

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.969 
strawberry so I outlined the stem part
but<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.110> don't<00:01:18.290> really<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.830> do<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
but you don't really have to do that

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.399 
but you don't really have to do that
because<00:01:19.430> we're<00:01:19.670> not<00:01:19.700> even<00:01:20.000> gonna<00:01:20.090> see<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
because we're not even gonna see it and

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.710 
because we're not even gonna see it and
then<00:01:22.100> I'm<00:01:22.250> kind<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.549> squiggling<00:01:23.240> at<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
then I'm kind of squiggling at the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.150 
then I'm kind of squiggling at the
bottom<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:27.410> don't<00:01:27.590> really<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.070> do

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
bottom and you don't really have to do

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.790 
bottom and you don't really have to do
that<00:01:28.340> either<00:01:28.520> I'm<00:01:28.940> just<00:01:28.970> doing<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.590> just<00:01:30.590> cuz

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
that either I'm just doing that just cuz

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.859 
that either I'm just doing that just cuz
I<00:01:30.890> don't<00:01:30.950> want<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> guess<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:31.820> then<00:01:32.570> taking

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
I don't want to I guess and then taking

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.240 
I don't want to I guess and then taking
the<00:01:32.929> toothpick<00:01:33.350> I'm<00:01:33.560> just<00:01:33.770> gonna<00:01:33.890> start

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
the toothpick I'm just gonna start

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.219 
the toothpick I'm just gonna start
making<00:01:34.399> small<00:01:34.820> circles<00:01:35.060> into<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.720> icing<00:01:36.200> to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
making small circles into the icing to

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.499 
making small circles into the icing to
heal<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.130> I'm<00:01:37.369> gonna<00:01:37.520> let<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.729> rest<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.149> 30

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
heal it and I'm gonna let it rest for 30

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.169 
heal it and I'm gonna let it rest for 30
minutes<00:01:38.800> after<00:01:39.800> 30<00:01:40.009> minutes<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.670> should<00:01:40.729> be

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
minutes after 30 minutes it should be

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.710 
minutes after 30 minutes it should be
nice<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.950> crusted<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.090> I'm<00:01:44.149> gonna<00:01:44.300> go<00:01:44.479> in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
nice and crusted and so I'm gonna go in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.309 
nice and crusted and so I'm gonna go in
with<00:01:44.750> my<00:01:44.929> Brown<00:01:46.240> royal<00:01:47.240> icing<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:48.170> gonna

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
with my Brown royal icing and I'm gonna

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.660 
with my Brown royal icing and I'm gonna
start<00:01:48.710> piping<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.670> bottom<00:01:50.090> half

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
start piping the bottom half

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.450 
start piping the bottom half
the<00:01:52.670> reason<00:01:53.030> why<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.810> top<00:01:54.140> red<00:01:54.830> portion<00:01:55.280> needs

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
the reason why the top red portion needs

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.789 
the reason why the top red portion needs
to<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.790> stiff<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.540> because<00:01:57.020> if<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:57.770> a

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
to be stiff is because if you do a

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.490 
to be stiff is because if you do a
wet-on-wet<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:59.450> brown<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.229> red<00:02:00.380> are

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
wet-on-wet the brown and the red are

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.230 
wet-on-wet the brown and the red are
just<00:02:00.710> going<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.950> mix<00:02:01.100> into<00:02:01.490> each<00:02:01.610> other<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.119> we

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
just going to mix into each other and we

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.080 
just going to mix into each other and we
want<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.720> look<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.560> brown<00:02:04.220> is<00:02:04.549> on<00:02:04.580> top

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
want it to look like the brown is on top

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.890 
want it to look like the brown is on top
of<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.450> red

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
of the red

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.889 
of the red
therefore<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.190> is<00:02:07.520> much<00:02:07.759> easier<00:02:07.820> if<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.720> red

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
therefore it is much easier if the red

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.059 
therefore it is much easier if the red
is<00:02:09.140> already<00:02:09.649> crusted<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:11.590> again<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:13.040> use

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
is already crusted and again you can use

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.120 
is already crusted and again you can use
actually<00:02:13.910> chocolate<00:02:14.120> for<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.890> would

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
actually chocolate for this that would

I'm gonna push and then let go it should
create<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:41.890> tip<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.430> end<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:44.630> one

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
create a tip on the end like this one

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
create a tip on the end like this one
right<00:02:45.080> here

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 

and<00:02:47.700> make<00:02:48.510> sure<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.750> practice<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.800> still

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
and make sure to practice I'm still

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
and make sure to practice I'm still
getting<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.580> hang<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.030> but<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.300> think<00:02:51.960> like

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
getting the hang of it but I think like

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.620 
getting the hang of it but I think like
I<00:02:52.470> think<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.250> got<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.370> push<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> release<00:02:57.210> and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
I think I got it so push and release and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.320 
I think I got it so push and release and
it<00:02:57.690> should<00:02:57.870> create<00:02:58.080> these<00:02:58.470> cute<00:02:59.010> leaves<00:03:00.740> and

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
it should create these cute leaves and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.640 
it should create these cute leaves and
these<00:03:03.330> stiffer<00:03:03.810> icing<00:03:04.560> helps<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.730> leaves<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
these stiffer icing helps the leaves to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.770 
these stiffer icing helps the leaves to
hold<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.890> shape

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.309 

so<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:11.900> with<00:03:12.080> our<00:03:12.230> yellow<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.510> cut<00:03:14.510> out<00:03:14.780> a

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
so then with our yellow I just cut out a

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.170 
so then with our yellow I just cut out a
small<00:03:16.220> small<00:03:17.120> tip<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.890> I'm<00:03:19.760> gonna<00:03:19.910> make
