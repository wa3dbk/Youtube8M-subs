rather but there's just no way I can do
it<00:02:20.580> every<00:02:21.000> other<00:02:21.210> day<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:21.810> too<00:02:22.410> painful

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it every other day it's just too painful

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.490 
it every other day it's just too painful
so<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.120> go<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.660> end<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.110> intermittent

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so there you go the end of intermittent

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.600 
so there you go the end of intermittent
fasting<00:02:25.830> back<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:28.320> low<00:02:28.650> glycemic<00:02:29.310> load

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
fasting back to the low glycemic load

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
fasting back to the low glycemic load
diets<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:31.790> yeah<00:02:32.790> intermittent<00:02:33.660> fasting<00:02:33.810> for

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
diets and yeah intermittent fasting for

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.990 
diets and yeah intermittent fasting for
me<00:02:34.530> painful<00:02:35.310> painful<00:02:35.850> painful<00:02:36.510> painful
