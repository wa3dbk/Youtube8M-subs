want to know basically how to save that
search<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.629> he<00:00:36.720> didn't<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.019> to<00:00:37.140> keep<00:00:37.379> setting

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
up the search parameters every time you

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.079 
up the search parameters every time you
use<00:00:39.870> chessbase<00:00:40.470> now<00:00:40.769> one<00:00:40.979> solution<00:00:41.339> is<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
use chessbase now one solution is to

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.719 
use chessbase now one solution is to
create<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:42.510> database<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.320> those<00:00:43.979> games<00:00:44.339> for

create a database of those games for

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.340 
create a database of those games for
example<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> couple<00:00:45.449> of<00:00:45.510> videos<00:00:45.780> back<00:00:46.080> i

caro-kann advanced variation as you see
here<00:00:50.970> and<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> last<00:00:53.190> video<00:00:53.370> we

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
here and then in the last video we

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.219 
here and then in the last video we
applied<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.659> opening<00:00:55.170> key<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.989> which<00:00:57.989> meant

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
applied an opening key to it which meant

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.719 
applied an opening key to it which meant
that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.409> took<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.619> piece<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.460> existing

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
that we took a piece of an existing

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.630 
that we took a piece of an existing
opening<00:01:00.330> key<00:01:00.540> and<00:01:00.809> put<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.619> on<00:01:01.799> this<00:01:02.100> database

opening key and put it on this database

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
opening key and put it on this database
now<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.119> is<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.299> key<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.809> refresh<00:01:04.110> your

end games with mega database and you get

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.370 
end games with mega database and you get
a<00:01:38.280> key<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.729> different<00:01:39.179> kinds<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> end<00:01:39.749> games<00:01:39.990> of

a key of different kinds of end games of
course<00:01:40.499> clicking<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.130> plus<00:01:41.369> sign<00:01:41.579> expands

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
course clicking on the plus sign expands

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
course clicking on the plus sign expands
it<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.719> different<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.590> example<00:01:43.950> here

doing<00:02:43.840> an<00:02:44.080> endgame<00:02:44.350> search<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.460> could<00:02:45.700> go

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
doing an endgame search and I could go

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.390 
doing an endgame search and I could go
to<00:02:45.940> end<00:02:46.330> games<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.960> we<00:02:47.530> find<00:02:47.800> there's<00:02:47.980> no<00:02:48.130> key

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
to end games and we find there's no key

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.180 
to end games and we find there's no key
here<00:02:49.440> another<00:02:50.440> way<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.650> could<00:02:50.860> do<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.070> is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
here another way I could do it is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.120 
here another way I could do it is
because<00:02:51.370> I'm<00:02:51.670> setting<00:02:52.030> up<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.180> own<00:02:52.600> key<00:02:53.130> I'm

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
because I'm setting up my own key I'm

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.490 
because I'm setting up my own key I'm
going<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.370> create<00:02:54.640> an<00:02:54.970> index<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.540> my<00:02:55.810> own<00:02:56.050> I'm

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
going to create an index of my own I'm

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.640 
going to create an index of my own I'm
actually<00:02:56.770> going<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.250> do<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.460> under<00:02:57.730> themes<00:02:58.650> so

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
actually going to do it under themes so

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.860 
actually going to do it under themes so
when<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.800> select<00:03:00.010> themes<00:03:00.460> I<00:03:00.910> get<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> same

when I select themes I get the same
display<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.500> fact<00:03:02.740> just<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.010> double-check

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
display in fact just to double-check

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.010 
display in fact just to double-check
let's<00:03:03.700> go<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:03.880> sources<00:03:04.360> first<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:04.990> go

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
let's go to sources first and then go

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.720 
let's go to sources first and then go
back<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.380> themes<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.920> make<00:03:06.040> sure<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.550> have

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
back to themes to make sure that I have

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.420 
back to themes to make sure that I have
the<00:03:06.760> same<00:03:07.090> display<00:03:07.570> here<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.980> we<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.220> first

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the same display here what we do first

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.090 
the same display here what we do first
is<00:03:09.700> install<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.420> empty<00:03:10.960> key<00:03:11.260> what<00:03:11.740> we're<00:03:11.920> going

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
is install in empty key what we're going

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.010 
is install in empty key what we're going
to<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.550> we're<00:03:12.700> going<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.940> create<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.630> key

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
to do is we're going to create a key

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.140 
to do is we're going to create a key
essentially<00:03:14.710> with<00:03:14.830> nothing<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.370> it<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:16.000> did

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
essentially with nothing in it we did

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.670 
essentially with nothing in it we did
this<00:03:16.270> in<00:03:16.420> our<00:03:16.510> last<00:03:16.720> video<00:03:16.960> you'll<00:03:17.380> recall

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
this in our last video you'll recall

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.430 
this in our last video you'll recall
this<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.940> whilst<00:03:19.120> i'll<00:03:19.270> install<00:03:19.690> an<00:03:19.870> empty<00:03:20.200> key

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
this so whilst i'll install an empty key

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.870 
this so whilst i'll install an empty key
of<00:03:20.770> course<00:03:20.950> there's<00:03:21.130> nothing<00:03:21.400> here<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.700> no

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880
