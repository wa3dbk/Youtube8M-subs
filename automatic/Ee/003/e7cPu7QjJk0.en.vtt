know<00:04:10.379> having<00:04:10.680> come<00:04:10.890> off<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.220> season<00:04:11.430> where

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
know having come off the season where

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.729 
know having come off the season where
Bruce<00:04:12.000> had<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.540> guys<00:04:12.720> playing<00:04:13.110> defensively

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
Bruce had you guys playing defensively

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.090 
Bruce had you guys playing defensively
at<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.099> end<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:15.329> one<00:04:15.569> season<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.470> maybe

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
at the end of that one season is maybe

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.009 
at the end of that one season is maybe
the<00:04:17.280> best<00:04:17.400> thing<00:04:17.579> for<00:04:17.699> this<00:04:18.000> team<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.510> good

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
the best thing for this team a good

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.289 
the best thing for this team a good
blend<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.519> offense<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.669> defense<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.239> it

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
blend of offense and defense but it

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.120 
blend of offense and defense but it
seems<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.630> me<00:04:21.750> like<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:22.500> all<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.740> teams<00:04:23.039> that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
seems to me like of all the teams that

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
seems to me like of all the teams that
were<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.490> playoffs<00:04:23.610> last<00:04:24.000> year<00:04:24.270> maybe<00:04:24.419> New

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
were in the playoffs last year maybe New

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.710 
were in the playoffs last year maybe New
Jersey<00:04:25.080> played<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.340> attacking<00:04:27.180> style

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
Jersey played that that attacking style

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
Jersey played that that attacking style
but<00:04:27.960> they<00:04:28.080> were<00:04:28.139> also<00:04:28.380> very<00:04:29.000> responsible

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
but they were also very responsible

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
but they were also very responsible
defensively<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.870> seems<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.260> maybe<00:04:31.470> that's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
defensively it seems like maybe that's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.830 
defensively it seems like maybe that's
that's<00:04:32.100> what<00:04:32.310> Adam<00:04:32.580> Oates<00:04:32.729> has<00:04:32.940> in<00:04:33.150> mind<00:04:33.360> yeah

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
that's what Adam Oates has in mind yeah

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.040 
that's what Adam Oates has in mind yeah
you<00:04:34.410> know<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:35.070> can<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:35.840> didn't<00:04:36.840> have<00:04:37.020> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
you know they can we didn't have a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.250 
you know they can we didn't have a
practice<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.979> him<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.570> but<00:04:39.570> probably<00:04:39.960> like

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
practice with him and but probably like

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.050 
practice with him and but probably like
there's<00:04:41.130> going<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.340> be<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.460> much<00:04:41.820> different

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
there's going to be a much different

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.180 
there's going to be a much different
system<00:04:42.539> than<00:04:42.570> we<00:04:43.020> play<00:04:43.410> with<00:04:43.590> Dale<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:43.979> going

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
system than we play with Dale is going

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.510 
system than we play with Dale is going
to<00:04:44.280> be<00:04:44.370> probably<00:04:44.699> more<00:04:44.970> often<00:04:45.870> than<00:04:46.280> we<00:04:47.280> used

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
to be probably more often than we used

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.250 
to be probably more often than we used
to<00:04:47.639> see<00:04:47.940> us<00:04:48.180> but<00:04:50.240> again<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.780> can<00:04:51.900> see<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.169> New

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
to see us but again you can see in New

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.900 
to see us but again you can see in New
Jersey<00:04:52.590> play<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.100> stanley<00:04:53.400> cup<00:04:53.460> finals

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
Jersey play and the stanley cup finals

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.460 
Jersey play and the stanley cup finals
and<00:04:54.150> they<00:04:54.570> have<00:04:54.690> pretty<00:04:54.810> good<00:04:54.960> chances<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
and they have pretty good chances to

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.550 
and they have pretty good chances to
beat<00:04:55.650> them<00:04:55.800> but<00:04:55.979> los<00:04:56.970> angeles<00:04:57.419> was<00:04:58.110> very<00:04:58.350> good

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
beat them but los angeles was very good

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.090 
beat them but los angeles was very good
but<00:04:58.800> again<00:04:59.130> it's<00:05:00.260> it's<00:05:01.260> something<00:05:01.680> know<00:05:01.860> what

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
but again it's it's something know what

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.100 
but again it's it's something know what
we<00:05:02.280> going<00:05:02.699> to<00:05:02.789> learn<00:05:02.910> how<00:05:03.060> we<00:05:03.539> have<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.900> play

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
we going to learn how we have to play

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.610 
we going to learn how we have to play
better<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.680> i<00:05:04.770> think<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:06.539> goal<00:05:06.750> for<00:05:06.780> us<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.500> be

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
better and i think the goal for us to be

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.040 
better and i think the goal for us to be
better<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.099> so<00:05:08.430> it's<00:05:08.669> not<00:05:08.789> gonna<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.300> don't

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
better and so it's not gonna I don't

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.810 
better and so it's not gonna I don't
want<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.410> stop<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.770> now<00:05:11.190> growing<00:05:11.490> up<00:05:11.639> like<00:05:11.789> a
