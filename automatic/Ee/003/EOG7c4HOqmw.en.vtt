00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
if the value assigned to one item is

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.009 
if the value assigned to one item is
today's<00:03:13.709> actual<00:03:14.430> retail<00:03:14.730> price<00:03:15.060> or<00:03:15.359> if<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
today's actual retail price or if the
