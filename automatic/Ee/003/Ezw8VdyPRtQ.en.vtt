00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello my name is gabriel barrón de 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.809
 involved technologies consultants 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.010
 computerized and implemented new 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.299
 technologies for companies and 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.860
 professionals 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:22.720
 now he introduced you this new tutorial 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.000
 in this tutorial we will see what basis of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.030
 Ventilation purchase for nights there 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.200
 many brands and models and I'll be 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.500
 explaining step by step how to choose the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.850
 better for your eyes I will talk about 7 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.030
 points the number one point will be base 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.300
 of active and passive ventilation after 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.790
 the 2 when they have three types of 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.980
 ventilation the 3 is design quality and 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.329
 product quality after the fourth 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.880
 the size of the fans the fifth 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.880
 disorientation of fans 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.850
 imposition the sixth is feeding 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.990
 with usb or external transformers and the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 seven are known brands and those that are not 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 they are so known the number one point is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.370
 active 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.370
 here is active in mockus bases 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.580
 for ventilation are those that have 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.340
 fans and those that are passive are 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 those that only dissipate the temperature 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.590
 for playing the notebook against the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 base and in that way take out the heat that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.110
 they are usually concepts everything sometimes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.260
 only lifting a little bit and what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 only they do is excess after the 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.270
 number two and both have three types 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.440
 of ventilation for example that can 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.440
 show one that I have here 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.880
 that can take the air here 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.450
 side and they can get the air out 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 the sides of this side of here after 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 the second type of the two which is the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.840
 less frequent is that with the air of the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.900
 coast where here and I left it to capture 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.500
 and then the third is that directly 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 the temperature is dissipated by all 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.260
 surfaces as is my case of the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.069
 sea ​​and by the legal table of the night already 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.909
 that the heat 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:43.999
 then we have the third one that is design 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.480
 and product quality what is the 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:49.159
 design and product quality is when 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.139
 it has different forms and obviously in 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.709
 Imposing quality products can 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:57.170
 be well be well armed with good 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.510
 plastics good fans equal 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.040
 stable so that they do not fall apart less 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.689
 do not have problems with time 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.510
 even lawmakers continue 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:09.319
 working after he spent several 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.000
 years or also the design system to 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.519
 that can have the fans in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.790
 different places I will show you by 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.340
 example here we have this product that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.870
 has a fan to sing to clean 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.700
 work 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.010
 and there are others that you can have for the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.220
 researcher on this side and another side 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.780
 on the other side or several matches in 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.250
 the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.620
 in different sectors of the low 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.850
 then we have the size of the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 fans obviously with the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.459
 Largest fan is medium turns 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.380
 per minute pay and that what it means 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.510
 that are going to be quieter with nine 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.920
 more uncertain than ever for us not 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.160
 bother us 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.989
 in what would be the auditory part or if 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.230
 we have to do work by editing 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.050
 video of sounds and usually last longer 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 the coordinated counterparts are the 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.580
 small respirators for example if 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.190
 he had 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.990
 several small fans have to 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.180
 spin faster to get the 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.730
 same amount of air as oil is 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 great and what happens is that 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.930
 usually 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 wear faster and produce more 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.880
 noise after we have the fifth floor the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.229
 realization of the fans as they 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.590
 had previously said for example if the 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.370
 notebook easier if we have the takes 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.370
 of air here 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.100
 Ideally, we should have a 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.530
 a voice is we could multiply the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.160
 shooters on the boards then this 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.620
 most efficient way you have here in 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.860
 the middle 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.340
 then point number 6 although the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.610
 transformer or this type of bases 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.219
 obviously 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.460
 Most of the bases stores of 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.409
 ventilation for notebooks have 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.330
 usb connector but there are some that come 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.699
 with transformer because they have good 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.889
 this having the ivory comfort the 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.289
 connector for usb that you can take 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.740
 to the consulate for the other and with the 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.349
 battery power and is this 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.889
 base the other one is more uncomfortable because 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.689
 having 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:25.749
 so that everything works 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.419
 you have to be careful is that the product 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.000
 it's not a good brand of a very brand 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.710
 known 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.590
 in the fans will consume 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.050
 too much because that can reach 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.270
 produce damage to the usb port of the 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.700
 notebook because you are not prepared to 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.960
 this kind of constant downloads of 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.880
 streams and then the number 27 would be 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.160
 and the best known parts that are today 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.790
 in the market for example that are 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.610
 cervantes cooler master targus beijing 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.500
 salman and logitech those are the brands 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.320
 better known as there are others that are not 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.960
 very good as those of the net that does 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.030
 a lot of products and usually in 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.530
 the fans do not last long are very 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:14.030
 noisy and the plastic is usually reformed 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.860
 or disarm over time 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.460
 so well I hope you have them 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.360
 served this class and anything we 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.360
 you can ask the questions 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.150
