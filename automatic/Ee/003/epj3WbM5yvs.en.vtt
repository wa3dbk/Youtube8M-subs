00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.689
 although we are in our mosaic to the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.789

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.649
 See how brush arm is 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.630
 matizado in the part so it is clear in 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.000
 the lower part is darker I'm going to 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.830
 reload paint my brush 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.890
 I put the brush back on our 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.349

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.819
 opposite according to how you look at how 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.549
 the depth and form of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.319
 a little button I'm going to repeat it 32 times 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.120
 more to make it 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.629
 arrangement of three little buttons and nothing else 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.540
 I will place my brush with another posture 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.010
 and we closed all this bothered as he 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.290
 put the paint to the brush you are 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.659
 own agreement that gives you the effect of 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.879
 little button of a flower of course and 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.680

 little tilt the brush 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.060
 so that we can already see 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.739
 which is very fast you can practice it if 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.359

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.290
 until you mark the time on this side and 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.450
 simply looking for that always the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.460

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.610
 triangulito in the lower part is more

 previously advanced this step and I'm going to 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.770
 occupy a dryer 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.419
 this is a dryer for screen printing 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.879
 but we can do it at home with a 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.650
 normal dryer whatever and 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.439
 just with a little bit of heat or with 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.000
 iron we can make it stand up and 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.669
 that we remain as the sample of this 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.710
 paint is called tribes and it will go up 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.870
 with heat 24 hours after having it 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.610
 applied we can already do this effect 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.580
 let's notice now as with the 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.590
 warmth begins to warm clear today 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.569

 a trip at the end I came perfectly 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.419

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.849
 accompanying lines and I'm also going to 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.710

 I saw part of the volume that was accurate 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.750
 that's what it does with a difference 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.300
 of the shoe that volume that gives 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.919
 I'm very sorry that you cited different very bad

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.830
 this kit anywhere in the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.569
