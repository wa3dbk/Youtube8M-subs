00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.160
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.509
 with you again the dough kitchen 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.759
 r7 250 ultimate you knew the whole company 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 sapphire is a great getaway she went 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 much further and mgi 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 Well, they have the day of the hall and renamed 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 hd 7730 in r7 250 a sapphire did 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.730
 something unimaginable ultimate version is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.730
 not r7 250 it is not 384 and 512 streaming 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.430
 processors not 24 from 32 texture units 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.579
 twice as many rop blocks we are long 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 puzzled tried to compare r7 260 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.230
 but the puzzle turned out to be simple guys this 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.840
 just hd 7750 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 just renamed one to one and y 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 We had a review of this map June 9, 2012 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 of the year 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 and it is in the passive version then 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.000
 warming up the card was up to 76 degrees now 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 up to 78 single fans and in principle 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.719
 guys this is really a gift for 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 lovers of completely passive silent 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.369
 systems given that the throttles and any 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.540
 other elements of the board do not whistle true 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.890
 what we have not mentioned 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.659
 we don't really like that system 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 cooling goes beyond the map 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 so she can prevent paying top 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.390
 or processor on the flour lira so in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 Ideally, the CPU cooler should be 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 dropsy or modest 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.509
 size or before the video card should go 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 write express slot and short board 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.830
 him since we had a review on 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.509
 the exact same map took two years and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 we have the opportunity not only to do 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.950
 before est but will add new games all 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 tests we made do with overclocking 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 which is surprisingly just running 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 utility and mass of the burner 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.070
 and all the sliders all the way right 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 the way the chip was 800 became 900 megahertz 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.009
 the memory was 4600 and it became 5000 megahertz 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600
 but also what battlefield 3 is leaving 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 18 fps machines 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.649
 this card is not for high quality 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.759
 our standards test useless 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490
 there will be a slide show 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.990
 so leave in full hd resolution 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 we will remove smoothing in general and we will 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 select the quality level so that fps was 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.250
 more or less playable in battlefield and 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.439
 you can stay at ultra fps will be 29 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.690
 at the exit of the car that is shut off 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.930
 smoothing gives an increase of 30 percent 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.659
 to performance 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.280
 4 battles of the machine itself puts the average 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.750
 40 fps settings 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 not bad in principle 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.090
 same mean role settings from and in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.680
 Metro 2033 40 fps and no drawdowns 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.660
 however you can switch 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.850
 and high but then fps will have 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.130
 dangerous traits and 30 fps and failure to 23 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.740
 in the new metro from the map to high even 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.140
 without smoothing you will not play 14 fps 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.840
 Well, where does the average mean but not 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.850
 brings us less joy than 25 fps and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.070
 just going to a low setting for something 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.900
 changes and if at the same time leave direct x 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.030
 11 for the tenth version, then generally beauty 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.879
 we hit on medium quality settings 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 only gives 30 fps lara croft on 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.209
 parameters normally gives him whatever it is 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.360
 strange 48 fps 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.710
 she's high 35 fps which is also very 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.080
 not bad 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.480
 krayzis 3 on average settings a little 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.730
 above 25 fps 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.530
 assassin black flag need to temper 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.540
 appetites and reduce the quality of pictures with 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.489
 high give away normal disable 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.790
 some things like blur but also in this 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.989
 case fps will be extremely dangerous trait 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.319
 25-30 although with such parameters 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.280
 you can pogamat what we say pro hd 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.010
 7750 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.200
 or r7 250 ultimate and anti-aliasing on 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.700
 full hd you can safely forget while 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 medium or high settings available 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.099
 qualities 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.900
 if going completely passive 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.440
 system and under resolution less than 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.840
 full hd 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.549
 the price of a video card is about three thousand 800 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.650
 rubles which is somewhat more expensive than usual 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.790
 versions thereby you pay for 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.790
 cooler without fan 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.560
 This was a card from Santis and with you it was 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.010
 Alina 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.010
 bye Bye
