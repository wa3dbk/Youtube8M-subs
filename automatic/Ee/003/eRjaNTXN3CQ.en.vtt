 Hello Traders! 

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.656
 We make chicken breast wrapped in bacon. 

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:19.728
 Ingredients: 

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.322
 10 slices of homemade bacon, 

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:29.613
 0.5 kg chicken liver without heart, 

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:32.475
 1 tablespoon marjoram, 

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:35.312
 2 cloves of garlic, 

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.398
 1 tablespoon of fat. 

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.453
 First, we put a little fat in a refractory bowl. 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.211
 We put a liver in every bacon slice. 

00:01:15.143 --> 00:01:19.626
 Puncture it with a toothpick to not fall apart. 

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:41.589
 Wrap it until the ingredients are consumed. 

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:51.320
 We leave the remaining liver to the rolls. 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.994
 Chop the garlic. 

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:17.016
 Let's get into the marina. 

00:02:19.407 --> 00:02:21.233
 Mix well. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.421
 Sprinkle the liver and rolls. 

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:35.114
 If the bacon is salty, we don't have to sigh. 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.689
 Cover with aluminum foil. 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.483
 Bake in medium heat oven. 

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:52.595
 After 15 minutes, remove the foil. 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.318
 Continue to bake. 

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:09.165
 For 15 minutes, bake on a large flame. 

00:03:17.102 --> 00:03:22.390
 Serve with soft bread. 

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:31.212
 Enjoy your meal! 

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:38.513
 We preserve our traditions!
