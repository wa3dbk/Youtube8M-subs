00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello good bi - in your trade of 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.600
 teacher now let's continue with 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.360
 this course to become 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.699
 authentic formulation machines 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.250
 get from scratch high and we're going to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.300
 continue with the metal wires in 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.580
 nomenclature 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.710
 first of all insist and there are many 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.199
 people who tell you the intruders very 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.029
 easy step to study the no mistake 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.009
 error error 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.740
 Intruders are easy for people 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.350
 at home that no longer but they are the base and 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.330
 if we understand well the easy 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.280
 we're going to mess with the acids now 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.110
 the rough we understand the easy ones well 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.210
 then the difficult ones are going to be more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.330
 easy to understand for and because there 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 things that are going to be equal to what 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.020
 let's learn now we're going to have to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.200
 use almost always then better 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.030
 learn it with simple compounds that 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.620
 not with those compounds that are very 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.610
 complicated for then we have to go 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.020
 little by little 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.150
 I say, there are people who go from 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.239
 study them and at least see the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.040
 videos and then think then very 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.190
 important traditional nomenclature the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.350
 What more problems will it give us? 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.510
 the most difficult if this is going to be the most 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.250
 difficult then let's see an example 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.740
 simple 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.330
 and then we are going to advance the signs 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.330
 they are not usually very complicated but good 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.640
 you'll see how much fun even to do 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.790
 some things in the nomenclature 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.670
 traditional 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.200
 ok we already know that we have three 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.970
 types of nomenclatures and as we have 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.250
 explained three types of nomenclatures 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.840
 is the systematics that for me is the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.120
 easier the stock that is in the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.260
 half the traditional the most difficult one 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.050
 so good knowing that the most 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.690
 difficult we have to attend to the most 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.120
 difficult well then as it is named is 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.640
 and hard plus the metal finished in points 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.860
 suspension this means that in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.600
 case of having two valences 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.240
 you act with the older teacher 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 icod termination and act with the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 lower termination in pos well by 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.650
 example let's see a metal to have a 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.210
 metal that has two valences per 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.520
 example jazz to jarreau has 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.190
 valencia plus two and more three iron 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 cobalt and nickel plus 2 and 3 as it acts 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.840
 with valence 2 which is the small 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 determination in bear dogs and when 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.030
 acts with valence 3 which is the highest 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.959
 if you have 2 and 3 when you act with the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.000
 little 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.430
 ferrous and when acting with the big 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 for example the nickel that also has 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.540
 valencia plus 2 and more 3 when it acts as 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.010
 small valence will be neither that and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.120
 when I was with the big valence that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.360
 is the 3 niko well let's change anything 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.150
 gold for example that you have valence 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.180
 leaves 1 and 3 very well when acting for 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.709
 little way that is the 1st euros oy 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.010
 when it acts as a large valence that is 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.709
 the factory 3 vale come the platinum 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.950
 platinum lead and tin plus dose plus 4 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.570
 then 2 and 4 and then the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 platinum with the performance valencia 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.989
 small is platinum so and when it acts with 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.660
 its 44 large platini here worth a 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.120
 Sometimes it's a bit difficult to name them 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.950
 weird things I sometimes get tongue 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.629
 I'm not able to say it easier 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.819
 well that's when you have more times 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.620
 when it has a unique valence that 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.709
 it happens you can do two things worth 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.080
 termination in icod or not putting any 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.519
 prefix is ​​for example lithium lithium 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 has valencia 1 there are people who say 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.950
 elliptical of people who say lithium to me 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.410
 I like it more is the second way to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.420
 do it because there are names then out there 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.209
 very rare that people invent 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
 then it is better to put lithium and up 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.220
 politicians and the law of lithium yes but there 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.610
 things to luminic for example could be 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.739
 I've always seen good aluminum that 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.950
 no matter need to know that if you have two 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.019
 valences the smallest termination in 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.640
 bear and the greatest determination in 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.130
 good disk well let's make the axis it 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.049
 ok then this would be potassium and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.769
 potassium how many thanks does one have then 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.769
 it would be and hard 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.090
 of potassium simply and plainly 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.890
 there are people who put potassium also worth 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.660
 the calcium how many planets does the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.460
 calcium alone has a unique valence that 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.460
 it's more 22 and hard 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.040
 of calcium that we could put calcium 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.060
 because it is unique also worth of calcium 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.760
 there is no calcium or calcium 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.130
 meat well for the newspaper this is very 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.040
 iron hard then you have to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.020
 carry as you have it plus 23 when 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.570
 acts with valence 2 will be ferrous and 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.250
 when acting as ferric 3 valence well 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.639
 like valencia is acting with the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.699
 valencia 2 true and hard hills 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:51.960
 it's fine when I chaste players here 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.960
 of three and hard 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.460
 and if nothing happens what kind of language 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.740
 well here the lead the lead that valence 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.200
 has platinum lead and tin more dose 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.180
 plus 4 ok then he's acting for the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.870
 small valence with the valence of more 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.680
 2 then it will be hydride 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.680
 directions 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.420
 it's very difficult to say and now as 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.569
 is acting like 24 euros today 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.169
 bloomberg 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:30.629
 ok and then the important thing about this 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.300
 video is to start entering the 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:37.889
 Traditional nomenclature is valid if it has 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.719
 two valences is worth and ccoo the biggest and bear 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.619
 the least bad and if you have more than two 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.909
 valences or eye eye me when I gave you that 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:47.429
 is that you have not seen my videos well or 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.439
 you did not study them when I jordi 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:52.649
 Failures of metals insist a lot 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.569
 that has a positive valence or two 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:55.709
 positive valences and he got a roll 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.860
 of milk that I do not want to go back to 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:00.930
 put them is worth fine then you can have 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.599
 a positive valence or they can have two 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.060
 positive valences, let's not advance 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.300
 events 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.190
 and now we are going to do some exercises 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.380
 with the exercises that are all in my 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.560
 blog search if you want to do it 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:20.040
 on youtube you are already on my blog in the 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.070
 Math teacher's blog formulation and 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.840
 I have the course and all the links and 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.910
 now let's do a series of 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.919
 Some exercises are going to be solved 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.900
 on video but it's going to be there for an hour 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.550
 making formulation then what I have 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.889
 done is making some chips there 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.320
 then first of all for those of 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.419
 cover gaps that you make and 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.570
 after ages the correct button and 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.340
 the solution appears so simple little 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.590
 it's going to complicate life a lot 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.950
 so that you practice the cider 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.860
 ok I'll do two videos I think if 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.470
 match and today I am that what threw it 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.560
 I'm all going to do two videos explaining 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.750
 making three or four 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.389
 exercises three or four 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.460
 sections of each exercise so that 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.680
 see how I want you to do it 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.080
 and then you do them and what 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.610
 we correct come and cheat a little 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.610
 also come see you
