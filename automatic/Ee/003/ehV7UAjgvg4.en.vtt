00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 the scum were these breaking 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.690
 italy which we talk about things 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 normally a long video is now a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
 short video primera long then it was 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.740
 shrewd males know what I am 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 speaking just bad joke me 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
 I go after we first talk about two things 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.199
 immigration to the United States in a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 some sense you all know what a must is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.539
 explain to you what immigration is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.460
 be the united states in that case of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 minecraft is also in this case I would like 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 don't have to explain what it is but if you don't 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.460
 you know is a very well known video game that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 allows the player or players who 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.210
 play online multiplayer by 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 explore endless worlds build 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 any kind of things using i 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 The materials of that world are losing hours 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 hours hours and weeks a certain point and then 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.539
 become months becomes a thing 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.190
 pathological I assure you hydra thing 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 absolutely futile but also of mm 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 fun and I think this is the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 end the sense of a game 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.340
 rodrigo gassman and one of these 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 Minecraft enthusiast players is a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 10 years and almost all of the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.119
 his life lived in the united states 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 despite actually going into 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.220
 Mexico 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 at the age of two together with his parents 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 to the facts crossed the borders of Mexico 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 to get to California where he spent 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 the last eight years of his life but 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.119
 migration laws in the United States 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 they are very strong and often come 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.390
 even look like the model ri 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 lately this thing is a bit 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 changing because actually a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.970
 model that uses the armed army i 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.369
 borders the same barbed wire to 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.930
 borders is forced repatriation once 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.369
 that you tend to be discovered 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770
 may not be the best of the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.509
 examples to follow however the parents of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 this 10 year old child joins the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.560
 united states with a tourist visa 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.299
 here is the visa for tourists remain in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.100
 reality a very long time in the country 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.600
 and even if they actually find work 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.939
 they are illegal immigrants 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.920
 then they are discovered and then i 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.509
 repatriated immediately but the thing 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 beautiful said from this story that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.869
 while parents try to move 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.729
 illegally to try to return 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.320
 in the united states the child ends 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.420
 instead at the center of a series of motions 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 both on facebook and on the internet in 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.110
 kind that you present directly to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 governor of california by 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.799
 of students from the same school in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.879
 which one went to the small I say that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.039
 they ask that he and his family 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.510
 can return to california 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.950
 allow the child to see his own again 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.750
 friends but apparently the thing 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.250
 will take many years to level 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.769
 bureaucratic therefore perhaps bureaucracy 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.569
 it is not only here that it is slow 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.219
 however the nice thing is that in the end a 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.659
 this group of students hold on 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.359
 contact with their schoolmate 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.609
 rodrigo create a minecraft server 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.989
 which is called rodrigo world which is the 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.730
 world of rodrigo for those who do not understand 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.319
 English which is a world in which one is 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.489
 can play on minecraft for those who don't 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.290
 he still understood what we are 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.970
 speaking and is one of those stories where 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.620
 again as we said yesterday 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.629
 internet world mixes with the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.819
 real world is actually in this 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.040
 case there is no legal cause in the middle 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.720
 but there is a nice gesture made by children 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.549
 10 years than to keep in touch 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.829
 although they live in two different ones 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.169
 nations to feel close to each other 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.730
 others use a video game things 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.980
 most beautiful happen through the ho children 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.930
 said something terribly honeyed 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.030
 seems a bit barbaric so I can 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.019
 tell us simply that it crushes up 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 this link 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.750
 this should be the voice of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.459
 barbarous urso sucks anyway 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.319
 crush on this link you can go 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.879
 to see other news of the day e 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.269
 I've been to ezio this is the brake 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.269
