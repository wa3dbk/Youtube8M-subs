00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 And then guys, come back here with more. 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.890
 a video and this time I brought it here 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.189
 channel pace of solution 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is a relatively heavy game neither 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:24.749
 for those who have no interest in such 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.050
 powerful and this is a game at stake and 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:31.229
 I already expected to be very light and installed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.629
 he is totally hopeless here 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:37.079
 playable 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:40.050
 and it was exactly in playable he swung right 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.890
 well I joined him and walked a little 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.199
 and in the end a lot of things 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 I put the flaps to record and 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.719
 confetti legacy 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 it rotates to 71 frames and if you stayed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.190
 looking at the ground he goes to ten 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.620
 awards says right on it being there wheel 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.950
 with about eight friends 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.800
 Which does not change much, right? 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.100
 oh well, hitman absolution from being weak 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.260
 installed played recorded course or in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 My friend's illustrious presence 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.920
 inseparable leg is not my partner there 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.600
 who is always following me in games 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 will ever make about three years then it is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 That's it, I hope the video has 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 been useful and I also hope you have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.210
 I like it in video beauty, that's it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 and until the next video 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.430

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
