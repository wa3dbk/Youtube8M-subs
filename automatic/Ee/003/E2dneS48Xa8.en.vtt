00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.690
 hello very good everyone I'm fury we go 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.029
 to see how to create a lot of action 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.640
 we will be immortal and we will make rounds 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.860
 fast and very easily what you have 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.420
 what to do come with the shield the plant 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.210
 it's here in the corridor right in the access 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.590
 The chairlift will be red 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.350
 you are going backwards until you 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.600
 let him place it and plant it jce if he 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.890
 you have put well the few 2000 that 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.989
 come for this back part it 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.809
 will be stacked on the shield without 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.519
 get to break and a second third or 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.960
 fourth player may be able to kill him 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.629
 the zombies that are coming over there 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.879
 now another player look at us 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.549
 stooping roughly half the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 downstairs and crosshead 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:53.650
 horizontal I leave it right at the edge of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.000
 this fence at that point there already 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.680
 we will be well placed and this 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.290
 way we will do a lot of action to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.310
 our left as you are seeing 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.500
 OK 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.030
 I do not recommend doing it alone just in case 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.710
 we have put the shield of us well 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.670
 well on the right side and we could 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 kill 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.940
 I recommend coming well equipped with the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.160
 titan at the marked point improved in 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.200
 good weapons and so on a player to 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.820
 crouched down they take me killing all the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.680
 2000 that we come face to face that will be 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.080
 most of the round we will have a 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.660
 restaurant pretty fast and the others 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.790
 the other player looks good in this one then 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.990
 two or three more we will stay in this 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.360
 area here killing those of us 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.700
 come here and in this way 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 we can reach very high rounds very 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.400
 easily and taking the bonuses 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.290
 etc etc the trick is recorded yesterday 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.430
 that is, it works 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.470
 today after all the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.360
 patches that have come out and that has been 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.310
 everything I hope you liked and we 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.460
 we see in the next video until the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.460
 next 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.350
 it will be better than not 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 better than not
