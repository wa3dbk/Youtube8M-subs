00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.760
 this time I have to dance the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.350
 hanky panky song of madonna of the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.389
 tic face movie and we're going to go 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.129
 with a freestyle freestyle that 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.010
 see how a usual one I think very well 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.720
 about the character that you have to 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.720
 interpreting is a fatal option 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.730
 not of course scientist fully and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 very simply I say because no 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 I say I'm an actress this week, we're going to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 have a quite complicated challenge but 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 In the end I always said that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.809
 things do not have to be easy for me 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.809

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.480

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.440

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:41.500
 pretty good but I feel that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.870
 I lacked agility if I like the music 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.140

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.760
