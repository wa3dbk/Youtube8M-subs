 details of what will change 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 allowing us to mention the great 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.320
 priority for 2015 diversity 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.970
 strategic with this we mean that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.500
 Our goal is to give you more ways to 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.940
 achieve victory so that 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 decisions you make during the game 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.649
 be as important as the selection 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.600
 of the champion then we go with the jungle the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.160
 diversity here is also important is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.079
 true that we already said something very similar 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.000
 the preseason last year but in 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.489
 2015 we are adopting a focus 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.440
 different we have new objects and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.000
 interesting news to crush and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.559
 the monsters are going to be harder in order 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.839
 to accentuate the differences between a 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.550
 warwick and a bouquet to start the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.230
 spiritual objects have disappeared 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.180
 with machete the hunter can be 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.830
 make four different objects each 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.660
 one of which modifies crush of 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 a different form stalker sword 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.400
 Oriented ambush allows damage and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.380
 slow down enemy champions 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.180
 furtive knife ideal for 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.800
 invasions grants bonuses to 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.880
 crush camps on the enemy side 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.950
 from the jungle 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.869
 Skirmish saber is an ideal object 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.670
 for duels after crushing a 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.899
 adversary grants a combat improvement 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.970
 against the rival that will last several 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.190
 seconds 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.990
 finally edge of explorer is 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.640
 thought to maximize the accumulation of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.290
 gold since it turns crush on a 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 area effect that restores human life 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.130
 when you use it you can also 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 acquire incantations what we 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.580
 allows you to get statistics that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.170
 are desired for the end of the game 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.590
 read their description well because here they 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.570
 we give them the most basic information 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.880
 we have also added bonuses to 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.859
 crushes the monster in short to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.299
 crush and knives get an improvement 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.819
 of true vision when they detect you 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.460
 on guard the gloomy invoke a 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.960
 ghost that provides vision the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.019
 bronze provide you with a mesh 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.340
 poisonous spines the tricks allow you 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.950
 Stun monsters every few 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.720
 attacks and monsters and celestial 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 they restore human life probably 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.799
 you can deduce which is which and finally 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.390
 in the category of the jungle 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.310
 we would like to mention the new favorite 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.530
 of the hobby the elusive crab 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.299
 this robust crustacean tries to avoid 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 combat at all costs but if you get 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.810
 ending with him will reveal to you the lair of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.340
 baron or dragon and will provide to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.170
 all team members an altar 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.300
 speed thanks Mr. crab 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.440
 now we will talk about the objectives to the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.980
 which are we going to give a new approach 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.360
 strategic first the turrets the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.040
 interiors have a new shield 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.870
 regenerator that also extends to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.180
 close allies what it provides 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 greater security in the face of sieges and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.080
 if what you are seeing is a laser it 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.970
 it's about a novelty of the turrets of the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.319
 inhibitor that slows down and reduces 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.050
 damage capacity of those to whom 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.050
 reach to stop those annoying yaks 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.140
 now courage is a formidable enemy 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 instead of an appetizer for the end 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.140
 of the game 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.640
 You must decide very well when you are going to 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.040
 attack him since when finally 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.629
 you get to end it will grant you a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.980
 improvement that will allow you to retire in the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.900
 half the time and it will increase 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.790
 considerably the strength of your 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.829
 united in the sieges 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.019
 dragons and turrets have always 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.549
 had a similar reward gold with the 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.260
 purpose of generating strategic diversity 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.120
 now the dragon grants a reward 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.920
 distinct a permanent improvement and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.719
 cumulative its power or increasing to 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.829
 As you kill more dragons 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:33.890
 become a bonus 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.989
 gigantic if your guy gets 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.489
 murder 5 those who are going to feel like 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.489
 true dragons are you 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.360
 this year we have focused on objects 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.770
 that provide strategic benefits in 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.020
 place of simple bonuses to the 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.090
 statistics to start we have the 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.770
 New elixir is the ruin grants damage 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.270
 additional against towers allowing 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.340
 show more aggressiveness in the streets 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.750
 the witchcraft increases the power of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.880
 ability and allows to cause damage 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.260
 true the iron increases the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.630
 Champion size and the movement of 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.400
 any ally that follows it and that of 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.500
 anger grants attack damage and certain 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.570
 life theft ability 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 each of them is designed for 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.330
 specific needs of a moment 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 concrete of the game 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.320
 in the second place I want to introduce you to 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.700
 justiciera glory outside the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.440
 statistics your activity provides 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.209
 a great speed bonus of 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.650
 move to pursue those teams 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.510
 who have the annoying habit of 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.190
 attack and retreat after a few 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.720
 seconds it emits a powerful wave of 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.250
 slowdown that affects all 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.140
 nearby enemy champions by 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.610
 misfortune the speed bonus 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.130
 does not increase the more annoying is the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.720
 rival team in summary what we are looking for 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.550
 is that there are different ways to win 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.860
 other ways you can go your 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.120
 team to get to victory and this 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.410
 it's just the beginning the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.850
 preseason is a moment that we 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.290
 allows you to experiment thoroughly with league 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.640
 of legends to improve it and there is a 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.290
 lot of changes more than we have not 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.850
 mentioned in this video you have more 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.890
 details on the website and in the notes 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.300
 of the latest version but the moment with 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.870
 this is enough to close the presentation 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.870
 of the preseason
