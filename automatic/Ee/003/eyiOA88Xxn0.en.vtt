and the fender liner on the on the later

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
and the fender liner on the on the later
cars<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.670> early<00:00:41.969> cars<00:00:42.180> don't<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> fender

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170

stops<00:02:00.780> working<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.640> position<00:02:02.939> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
stops working so the down position is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.910 
stops working so the down position is
where<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.500> linkage<00:02:04.979> bar<00:02:05.360> lines<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
where that linkage bar lines up in a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.839 
where that linkage bar lines up in a
straight<00:02:08.250> line<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.050> bar<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.640> right

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
straight line with the bar here so right

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.270 
straight line with the bar here so right
about<00:02:12.060> there's<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:13.290> fully<00:02:13.590> down<00:02:13.890> right

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
about there's it's fully down right

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.240 
about there's it's fully down right
the<00:02:14.459> end<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.000> end<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> stroke<00:02:16.250> goes

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the end of the end of the stroke goes

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.460 
the end of the end of the stroke goes
this<00:02:17.400> bars<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> way<00:02:18.300> back<00:02:18.350> when<00:02:19.350> it's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
this bars and all the way back when it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.660 
this bars and all the way back when it's
all<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> way<00:02:19.740> up<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.010> bars<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.459> way

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
all the way up this bars all the way

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.320 
all the way up this bars all the way
forward<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:25.430> always<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> start<00:02:26.760> with<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
forward I always like to start with the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.780 
forward I always like to start with the
the<00:02:27.600> two<00:02:27.750> outermost<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.890> outboard<00:02:29.730> side

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the two outermost the the outboard side

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.430 
the two outermost the the outboard side
here's<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.450> good<00:02:30.600> shape<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:30.870> I'm<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.350> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
here's in good shape so I'm not going to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.000 
here's in good shape so I'm not going to
mess<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
mess with that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.530 
mess with that
and<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> undo<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.980> three<00:02:35.340> bolts<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and so I undo the the three bolts on the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.300 
and so I undo the the three bolts on the
inboard<00:02:36.900> side<00:02:38.030> using<00:02:39.030> either<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.310> combination

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
inboard side using either a combination

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.460 
inboard side using either a combination
wrench<00:02:41.970> or<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.660> actually<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:42.989> ratchet

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
wrench or this is actually a ratchet

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:54.740 
wrench or this is actually a ratchet
wrench<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:51.980> they're<00:02:52.980> loose<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:54.480> start<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
wrench so they're loose I can start to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.620 
wrench so they're loose I can start to
move<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.860> brac<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> up<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.670> down<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
move this just brac it up and down and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.140 
move this just brac it up and down and
it's<00:02:58.050> gonna<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.350> two<00:02:58.560> things<00:02:58.830> not<00:02:59.700> only<00:03:00.030> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
it's gonna do two things not only is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.720 
it's gonna do two things not only is
that<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.810> change<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.350> height<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.890> this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
that I can change the height of this

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.430 
that I can change the height of this
corner<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.209> can<00:03:03.450> change<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.200> height

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
corner I can change the the height

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.470 
corner I can change the the height
relative<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.580> valance<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.330> also

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
relative to the valance I can also

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.890 
relative to the valance I can also
change<00:03:06.840> how<00:03:07.050> far<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.950> forward<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.519> is

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
change how far back and forward it is

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.670 
change how far back and forward it is
from<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.110> hood<00:03:10.500> edge<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> change<00:03:13.019> those

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
from the hood edge and as I change those

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.559 
from the hood edge and as I change those
the<00:03:14.160> front<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.760> gonna<00:03:15.060> raise<00:03:15.360> or<00:03:15.540> lower

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
the front of it is gonna raise or lower

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.330 
the front of it is gonna raise or lower
a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.140> bit<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.590> then<00:03:16.709> we're<00:03:17.069> going<00:03:17.280> to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
a little bit and then we're going to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.850 
a little bit and then we're going to
adjust<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.730> last<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.989> again<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.530> kind<00:03:19.739> of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
adjust that last so again I can kind of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.880 
adjust that last so again I can kind of
you<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> little<00:03:20.640> too<00:03:20.790> high<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.890> can

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
you know this is a little too high I can

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.170 
you know this is a little too high I can
kind<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.130> get<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.640> where<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.880> want<00:03:26.180> kind

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
kind of get this right where I want kind

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.870 
kind of get this right where I want kind
of<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.480> by<00:03:27.660> feel<00:03:28.019> look<00:03:28.410> at<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> gaps<00:03:28.890> that's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
of do it by feel look at the gaps that's

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.240 
of do it by feel look at the gaps that's
about<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> then<00:03:31.769> when<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.070> where<00:03:32.220> I

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
want I can tighten this bracket down the

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:13.130 
want I can tighten this bracket down the
lift<00:03:57.570> bar<00:03:59.209> bracket<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.130> loose<00:04:11.989> I'll<00:04:12.989> be

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
lift bar bracket this is loose I'll be

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.870 
lift bar bracket this is loose I'll be
able<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.350> slide<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:13.739> back<00:04:14.010> bracket<00:04:14.459> forward

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
able to slide this back bracket forward

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.180 
able to slide this back bracket forward
on<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.150> back<00:04:15.329> which<00:04:16.200> then<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.620> know<00:04:16.739> changes

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
on the back which then you know changes

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.150 
on the back which then you know changes
the<00:04:17.340> tilt<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:18.169> kind<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> home<00:04:19.530> position<00:04:19.829> of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
the tilt of kind of the home position of

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.920 
the tilt of kind of the home position of
the<00:04:20.250> headlight

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the headlight

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.249 
the headlight
so<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.410> can<00:04:21.560> get<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.979> where<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.160> want<00:04:22.550> I

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.879 

think<00:04:27.259> that's<00:04:27.470> about<00:04:27.620> where<00:04:27.889> I<00:04:27.919> want<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.770> then

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
think that's about where I want and then

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.120 
think that's about where I want and then
I<00:04:30.979> can<00:04:31.130> turn<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:31.550> back<00:04:31.820> down
