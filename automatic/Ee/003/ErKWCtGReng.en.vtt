00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.360
 spears 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.020
 who 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.020
 clean 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.050
 how about friends here Sara with a video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 new this time is 30 of the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 tel aviv x 41 hearing aids a couple of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 days and selene boxing then you guys 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.100
 they left some questions telling me that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.869
 it seemed to me how they connected that is 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.790
 comparison of strong hearing aids 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.200
 that I also decided to not just do it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
 select option apart a small 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.699
 review of these hearing aids then I'm going to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 start and for that what we 're going to 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.350
 need is a transmitter the usb cable 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.390
 the optical cable and the hearing aids very well 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 friends then the first step is to remove 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 those little insurances almost transparent 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 of the corners of the optical cable is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.570
 say you are going to have your cable 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 optical just here let me approach 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.579
 I think it's at home appreciate well they have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.060
 this cable and right here is going to come 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.580
 insurance 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.670
 here, all you are going to do is 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.650
 remove it and they're going to do that in the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.970
 two extremes once we do that 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.950
 now in the back of the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.440
 transmitter let's have two inputs 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 optics one that says and one that says out 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.780
 let's take one end of the cable 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.730
 optical and we are going to place it exactly 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.430
 here if you ask the sahara how 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.900
 it goes like this so do not worry because 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.450
 there is like a little house that we 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.760
 indicates the way to place it then 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.280
 we just put it that way and you're done 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.380
 as you can see inside perfectly 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.080
 well and the other end we are going to connect 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.930
 to any of our consoles to our 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.000
 xbox 360 or our xbox one there is no 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.160
 loses in any of the consoles because 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.619
 they just have a single optical input 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.600
 then this is where this other 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.760
 part now what we're going to do is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.150
 take the usb cable which is the only one 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.130
 comes in the headphones the only usb what 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.150
 let's put the round part here 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.580
 where it says of csb and the other part that is 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.979
 a usb again we do the same 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.850
 process is going to go both to our xbox 360 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.890
 as 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.660
 xbox one depending on which console 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.970
 have and in what console they want to be 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.120
 listening to the next step is take 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.130
 our hearing aids x-41 and in the part 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.200
 contrary to where the microphone is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.360
 we'll have a cover that we're just going 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.150
 to do this we are going to remove and we are going to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.069
 insert the batteries that already includes the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 headband since we did all the steps 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.180
 that I just mentioned here in the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.010
 back of your transmitter we go 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 have a little button that says turn on 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.360
 or power we are going to press and what is going 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.040
 to happen is that we are going to have two bulbs 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.140
 in the opposite part I do not know if 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.330
 reach to reach to appreciate I think that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.910
 yes it looks very good we have only two 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 little bit and that tells us that it is 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.060
 I turned on the transmitter 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.890
 but so that I can have signal what 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.350
 let's do is turn on our xbox 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.330
 360 or our sixth which and once 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.760
 let's turn on our xbox 360 or our 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.460
 console let's see how the transmitter 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.790
 now he's going to have three little 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.070
 there it is, it has 3 little pieces and still we 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 one more step is to synchronize 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.040
 hearing aids with the transmitter for that is 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 a very simple step very simple because 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.360
 all we have to do is 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.170
 press the power button 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.170
 our hearing aids 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.090
 we push 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.190
 and once we press we can see 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.180
 as the hearing aids already have a signal and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.180
 they are ready to be used 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.939
 ok friends now we get to the part of the 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.849
 review here I have the x 3 I have the 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.590
 tissues you have the x-41 those were 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.689
 my first hearing aids I think it's not worth 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.670
 so much the pain to show them because 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.620
 they are even in the market they were 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.290
 basic and of the first had their 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.939
 pros and their cons even among the one 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.069
 it was used before and the earmuffs did not 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.959
 he liked it so much because as you can see it 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.389
 he treated them like they do not know how to be really 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.340
 they finish them very, very well and despite 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.750
 of that simply because of the use 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.099
 they got to wear this way 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.049
 now we have x 12 and x 41 and 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.299
 Many ask me if what is the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.849
 difference or which ones I recommend more and 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.709
 all good if you look for something 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.500
 a very, very accessible price very 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.449
 cheap on the trading page and apart 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.199
 a very good quality I recommend you to 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.419
 the x12 because as I tell you, be 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.520
 for its price for all this work 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.340
 pretty good they listen well still 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.310
 they work, however, because I had to 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.259
 innovate here as a poem also the point 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.169
 Hand these headphones is the fact 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.360
 that are wired on the one hand is bad 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.490
 the cables believe me I said no longer 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.749
 I do not want more wired but on the other 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.090
 side is good because you save the 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:49.909
 batteries now talking a bit about the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.580
 earmuffs to comparison of the x 41 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.699
 both were bad of the x12 because as 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.229
 can see are a little more oval 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.229
 circular and circular caps but 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.289
 ballads and that kind of thing that allows the 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.360
 ear better a better accommodation and more 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.879
 that as my ears are between medium and 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.099
 great these hearing aids will be perfect 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.020
 I do not know the size of your ears are very 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.990
 small new rules have no 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.550
 problem with the x-41 if they are medium 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.009
 to large teams are going to be 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.259
 perfect for you but also not 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.509
 be the x-41 stay behind are not 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.659
 uncomfortable but I felt a little more 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.180
 comfortable the x12 that more in microphone 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.089
 this sign is fixed it does not move not no 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.610
 I mean nothing obviously 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.589
 it moves and so in terms of community 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.050
 we also have a lot of comfort in the 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:41.449
 top part a very good material is 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.830
 different from those of the x 3 and if you 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.389
 they fix forgiveness of the 3 x I do not have anymore 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.939
 I knew my material but it is very 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.979
 different since the 12th and we 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:56.389
 allows more comfort 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:59.210
 now they pass a little bit to the x-41s in 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.370
 As for the round earmuffs 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.729
 I had mentioned the microphone 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.999
 removes there is also a little advice that 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.360
 I give them remove this little thing and they will see 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:12.680
 you are talking like this next 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.110
 right because sometimes they can tell you 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.849
 you almost do not hear you almost do not listen to you 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.370
 if it's afterwards the reason they have it 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.240
 vice versa they also accommodate it and again 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.240
 they put this 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.750
 there it is they put it ready they can do it 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.840
 back to back can make them 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.480
 bigger smaller on this side 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.640
 as I said the pro of the hearing aids 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.490
 it is that it is wireless 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.110
 The cons is that they are batteries and it is 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.690
 a tank like being spending on 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.910
 batteries and batteries but otherwise 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.610
 they buy good batteries everything goes to 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.340
 work out curiously at me from the x 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.470
 3 my batteries played too much in that 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.330
 time the batteries did not last 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.050
 two weeks but I leave the time that 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.659
 I played I think it was pretty good 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.840
 and likewise the earmuffs in the 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:06.120
 same material as that of the x12 very 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.210
 very comfortable this one quilted the word 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.830
 they move also for both sides to 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.190
 that there is no problem in terms of 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.210
 that now we also have the little button 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.210
 here I was approached a little more 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.210
 quickly 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.439
 there we have it, we have the button where it goes 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.709
 the cable that goes from the control to the 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.749
 hearing aids we also have one that is 

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:34.269
 because the volume obviously the volume of 

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:35.769
 game the chat volume is controlled to 

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:38.650
 through the cable they saw in the first 

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:40.720
 video check it out if you have not seen it 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.220
 and the good friends themselves I think that's 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.070
 the most important thing they have to know 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.389
 how to connect them and how do they work 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.150
 are the main functions of the 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:51.310
 hearing aids have some other doubt do not know 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.199
 Forget comments and answering 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.430
 more than I can in case they are 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.650
 questions that are already in the description 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.970
 as I told you a while ago, better 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.830
 check first that for me 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.870
 ask new things and do not be like 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.310
 a vicious circle so well then 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.350
 I hope you serve them see you in the 

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.630
 next video support me with a like ya 

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.050
 that helps me a lot and until next time 

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.050
 bye
