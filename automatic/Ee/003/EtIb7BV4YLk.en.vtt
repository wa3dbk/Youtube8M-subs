00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.500
 This is an easy and simple way to 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.040
 to have our engine clean is very 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.009
 important to have it always clean is 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.530
 using a degreasing foam it 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.540
 let stand about 10-15 minutes and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.669
 later with a hose without 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.220
 pressure nothing more to how to remove the 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.820
 foam will throw all the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.680
 the fat that the engine has and already after 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.430
 for aesthetics if you like to put some 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 rinse aid 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.800
 to this form all the foam is removed 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.800
 as also 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.409
 subsequently the stability 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.260
 in the engine temperature 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.630
 look, you shut up 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.550
 I like them in very greasy forts 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.080
 they can give you a pass with some 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.350
 brush with a rag to finish it 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.920
 procure in the electronic components 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 of the water ring in the case of this 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.940
 vehicle would be your computer that is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 very exposed 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.720
 and doing
