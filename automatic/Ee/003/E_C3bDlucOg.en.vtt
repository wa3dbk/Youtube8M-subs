00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 in 2013 France's rail network goes 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.020
 make an investment without 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.990
 in the provence alps region 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.719
 French Riviera 380 million euros are 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.910
 engaged to modernize develop and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.780
 maintain the example network of this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.029
 mobilization 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 the renewal of the track between races 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 human and martigues 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 this way has between 50 60 years for the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.650
 most of the constituents we came to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.710
 at the limit of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.840
 acceptable wear to continue to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.730
 circulate the trains in good 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.350
 Chinese conditions gets older the longer it takes 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.250
 do an intervention on it and so 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.200
 more short of money 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.550
 ok a moment when it is better to renew 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.379
 constituents to lower costs 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.170
 maintenance and renewal 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.660
 take back made 35 million euros 450 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.660
 people who will work in addition to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.730
 two months to come renew 30 km of 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.830
 railways for this renewal 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.739
 rff used means 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.839
 impressive fully mechanized a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.839
 mobile construction site composed of a multitude 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.000
 of trains called quick suite allows you to 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.680
 renew from 800 to 1000 meters of lanes 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.990
 railways per day 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.299
 true rolling factory there are none 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.799
 than three in France so far and rff 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.710
 has a brand new suite 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.540
 fast said number 3 used on the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.850
 construction site between martigues and reassurant 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.070
 each train to a particular function 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.930
 and carries out one of the five stages of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.369
 renewal of joy the first phase 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 really big jobs that helps the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.979
 stripping the train that is behind 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.040
 me 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.840
 remove the ballast where the sleepers then 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.790
 then by a carpet system 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.330
 evacuate it in a train that is on the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.550
 continuous way 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.880
 the second phase is to replace 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.040
 rails and sleepers the phase of 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.200
 substitution is indeed to 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.960
 remove sleepers and rails that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.120
 will have to be replaced once 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 ballast smooth out the pause train well 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.210
 placing the monoblock concrete sleepers 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 new rails are then attached to the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.320
 ties of the new sleepers 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.020
 then there is a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.300
 voice height with loads 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.400
 more ballads than at the age of those 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.869
 ballast under the sleepers that has a 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.849
 operation of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.510
 of making stress that none of the rail 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.099
 called liberation so that when 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.530
 temperature variations we do not have 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.659
 problem with the railroad and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.700
 then a period finishing leveling 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.700
 complementary following the consultation 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.049
 with the organizing authorities we 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.909
 took the choice not to disturb 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.430
 the circulation of everyday life is therefore 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.349
 to organize work from 21h 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.760
 in the evening until 5 in the morning on a 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.379
 site as it is successful 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.890
 important in fact that all teams 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.329
 work together in each his 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.489
 role 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.109
 as much the sncf on the mastery part 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.390
 delegated worker only on the part 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.090
 mastery of them general who ensures the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.410
 means in terms of security and we have 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.299
 also a big mastery team 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.280
 on-site work and the end of 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.569
 construction site by spring we 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.450
 can have a railway 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.069
 completely restored with a new condition 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.709
 which will guarantee security 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.459
 maximum traffic with a level 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.459
 of impeccable comfort
