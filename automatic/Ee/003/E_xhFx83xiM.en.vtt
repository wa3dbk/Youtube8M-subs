00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.859
 on which basis is based believes 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.340
 walking or do I have to far outstretch that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.910
 go back to my studies 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 I studied psychology that was 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:22.199
 1970 to 75 in mainz and that was the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.850
 time as the old psychology the more 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 a character logi was the more 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
 philosophically oriented where you were 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.960
 so to speak, what beings of man 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 thought yes that was replaced by 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.399
 experimental psychology and the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.399
 had a lot to do with 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.930
 conditioning experiments there 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.750
 you then rat through any 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.520
 racecourses and those were at the other 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 the end was the cheese that was the motive for 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.449
 the guess is to run and in between 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 There were electric shocks and you stop 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.300
 look how is it with frustration 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.820
 and conditioned stimuli and frustration 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 build something else with me 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.320
 then professor said we are there 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.090
 the god's image of man 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 by the rat next to pictoriality 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 to replace this phrase has me very much 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.020
 impressed and I'm afraid he has 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 had even been right in any case 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.330
 I'm nothing in this kind of psychology 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 Consciousness is learned 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.780
 but I learned a lot about 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 Conditioning via reids reactions 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.960
 that is a basis that just learn 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.549
 or behavior is something learned and 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 if I have a trauma so that you 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.159
 have a nearly fatal accident and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.329
 then for weeks in the hospital or 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.119
 that you and spilled in the avalanche 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:47.369
 was that characterizes the behavior 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.110
 so it's a very strong wright of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.630
 both leads to reactions and these 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.430
 reaction then I forehead later and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.860
 that's why the question is for me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.960
 the meeting when you tell me about 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.930
 with the things you do not come cope 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.329
 it started it so I try 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.869
 from the unwanted reaction to the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.910
 Learning experience to get where that started 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.460
 that is a traumatic learning 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.950
 In 100% every case I really have to 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.010
 so say to bend someone 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.080
 needs an incredible violence one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.740
 destructive violence, for example 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.270
 that you are under an avalanche and 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.630
 convinced that this is your end 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.910
 who is saved anyway is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.760
 This shock only by the rescue he 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.970
 not gone and if you think then 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.500
 the avalanche 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.720
 I 'll get the more out of here then 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.810
 accompany you this negative program 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.880
 for the rest of his days and can go through 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.170
 certain external circumstances turned on 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
 then you would be a human being yourself 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.280
 withdraws more and more because he is afraid of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.440
 does not come out anymore that's the one now 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 conditioning wrong already reaction 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.740
 then methodically means walking 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.820
 we work more in the sense of 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.030
 talk therapy that has the carl 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.850
 Rogers invented in the 30s 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.540
 humanistic psychology that goes away 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 that every human is the way to his 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.269
 own truth finds if you give them 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.390
 just let this path go 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:26.209
 that is, the less someone walks la 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.860
 the cleaner and uninfluenced comes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.900
 he to his findings so 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.550
 actually a very nice idea in the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.350
 practice of talk therapy 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.850
 she does not always work that can 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 be very superficial because the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.260
 Talking therapy is very and controlling 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.040
 yes and I use that idea that 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.230
 Everyone can find their own truth 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.239
 by asking him as to its 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.080
 his starting position 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.220
 so not to have memories 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.769
 any changes that is if 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.590
 You say I am one of the ones he is afraid of 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:04.280
 does not come out anymore he sees everywhere 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.360
 I'm afraid I can in the plane 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.769
 I did not come out anymore 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.209
 I can not sign a contract 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.750
 I'm scared I can not get out 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.850
 that makes my whole life impossible 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.530
 So I ask him for memories as 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.390
 he no longer came out 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.630
 that means I leave him his own 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:24.600
 go away but I make sure that he 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.949
 not from its thematic path 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.490
 so it deviates so the second fundament 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.199
 and talk therapy and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.460
 conditioning teaching and the third 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:40.350
 is fundament call what times the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.440
 Far Eastern thought as you like 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.570
 beautiful says this whole Buddhist 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.620
 Hindu idea that man is more 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.000
 is as a body and that it is a living 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.590
 beyond physicality 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.960
 an eternal life, so to speak 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.090
 In Christianity, yes , it does not exist 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.449
 considered as personal eternal life 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.550
 but in asia and you just say okay you 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.080
 Do you come here and in the body you go 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.199
 is after that where is possibly in 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.300
 other body this idea of â€‹â€‹a one 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.490
 what's outside the body 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.210
 can exist independently of the body 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.180
 fascinated me then and in mine 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.220
 meetings I find that it confirms 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.740
 So live that people looking for 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.410
 your experiences 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.710
 things are also outside 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.060
 this biography of this biological 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.680
 existence span 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.680
 and these are the three fundamentals
