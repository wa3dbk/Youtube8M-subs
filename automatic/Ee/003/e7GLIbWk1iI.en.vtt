00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.050
 scattered 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.050
 everywhere the periods 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.090
 I'm going m 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.090
 despite 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.490
 a pure and rustic but liters and its 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.490
 muse 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.790
 and we must add 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.600
 grated cheese 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.330

 I add a little breadcrumbs 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.269
 so that's how my food was 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:05.609
 still hot I'll put in the oven 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:07.199
 for 20 to 25 minutes on the other hand if 

00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:09.980

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.770
 can speak on the advance you 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.000
 but very offer all practically 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.230
 40 minutes why all these champions 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.490

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.490
 for 25 minutes at about 210 2 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.810

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.770
 twenty five minutes to 220 degrees is so 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.770
