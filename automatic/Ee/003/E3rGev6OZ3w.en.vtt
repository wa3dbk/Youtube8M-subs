00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
God is not great by Hitchens but the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.310 
God is not great by Hitchens but the
Bible<00:01:48.820> itself<00:01:49.180> will<00:01:49.509> turn<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.869> atheist

I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.880> because<00:01:55.620> what<00:01:56.620> we<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.190> told<00:01:57.670> about

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
I think because what we get told about

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.590 
I think because what we get told about
the<00:01:58.330> Bible<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:59.580> is<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.640> lot<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.090> picking<00:02:01.450> and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
the Bible is is a lot of picking and
