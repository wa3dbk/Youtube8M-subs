00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hello everyone, bother you again 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.360
 workshop would quark a new video review 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.429
 glands that came to me in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.510
 workshop so let's start let's start with the rim this 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.880
 both king plus would do yes here in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.859
 this color is pretty beautiful 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.730
 nadir point he double not peace 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 toned 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.309
 but strong enough zebras stiffness 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:41.910
 very well made 3 4 millimeters 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 width 16 height 36 knitting needles and 493 grams 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 weight in this we'll see so need wheels 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.199
 on bmx 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:57.930
 order hands about it ie availability 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:01.680
 further the kmc to 710 circuit is one of the most 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 best chains just awesome chain 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.650
 it is supplied with a lock it is practically not 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.650
 It stretches quite a bit there 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 figure pull parts so to speak here 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:24.600
 on a combination of colors silver 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 black on the bike looks good 110 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 links standard length 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.450
 with a weight of 410 grams very very 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.280
 price-quality is just superb 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 the ratio of edic now put and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 install it correctly you will have it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 forever on this shaybochki 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 to assemble the wheels on it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.759
 yo 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.290
 adds strength to your wheel 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.950
 reduces the likelihood that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.060
 nipple will throw out a piece of experience at 8 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 big stretch 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:07.480
 I advise you to use these washers when 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.300
 assembly not peace tinted rims weight 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.160
 it will hardly add a wheel by 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.090
 reliability 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.070
 salary carriage 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.140
 mid here like this they are delivered in such 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.120
 wonderful packaging others 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.760
 manufacturers don't bother just 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.030
 put the bearings with songs in a bag and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.110

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.690
 There are versions for 19 shaft and 22 shaft, everything is there 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.770
 the presence of such a package 2 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.680
 spacer step spacers themselves themselves 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:55.900
 bearings of sufficient quality 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:56.620
 carriages so here are their bike computers 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.550
 firms 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.340
 echo well in two variations wireless 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.880
 and wired have wireless 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.730
 go for 7 functions this is our speed 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.270
 current and average time current time 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
 travel distance odometer speed 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.150
 speed mode 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:27.690
 sorry here ergonomic beautiful 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:34.800
 body is prettier since sigma does 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:39.580
 find more expensive look and wired 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.640
 version with wire it is on 10 functions this 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.170
 distance speed odometer clock 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 scan average speed 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.510
 the maximum speed of travel time 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.430
 race speed and total ride time 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.430
 shows this bike computer 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.970
