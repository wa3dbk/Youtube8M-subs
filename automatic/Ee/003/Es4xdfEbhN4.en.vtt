00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
makes it a little bit easier it makes it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.990 
makes it a little bit easier it makes it
a<00:04:29.990> little<00:04:30.050> more<00:04:30.320> percussive<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.100> has<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.490> a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
a little more percussive and has that a

type<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.100> feel<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.820> again<00:04:35.030> I'll<00:04:35.180> play<00:04:35.360> it

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
type of feel so again I'll play it

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:45.400 
type of feel so again I'll play it
really<00:04:35.750> slow<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:44.660> almost<00:04:44.870> sounds<00:04:45.110> like<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.230> big

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
really slow it almost sounds like a big

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.390 
really slow it almost sounds like a big
bender<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.100> not<00:04:50.800> if<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.890> do<00:04:52.010> some<00:04:52.160> palm

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
bender but it's not if you do some palm

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.770 
bender but it's not if you do some palm
muting<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.880> becomes<00:04:53.150> even<00:04:53.390> more<00:04:53.420> percussive

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
muting it becomes even more percussive

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.350 
muting it becomes even more percussive
and<00:04:54.170> more<00:04:54.620> chicken<00:04:55.010> picking<00:04:55.310> like<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:56.060> that's

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
and more chicken picking like and that's

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.810 
and more chicken picking like and that's
really<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.140> works<00:04:57.440> really<00:04:57.950> for<00:04:58.220> mid<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.640> up

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
really it it works really for mid and up

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:10.870 
really it it works really for mid and up
tempo<00:04:59.180> stuff<00:04:59.480> if<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.690> play<00:04:59.900> it<00:04:59.960> real<00:05:00.170> slow

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.370 

it's<00:05:11.880> alright<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:12.510> it's<00:05:12.660> really<00:05:12.870> better<00:05:13.140> for

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
it's alright but it's really better for
