I've<00:00:08.459> been<00:00:08.700> really<00:00:08.910> waiting<00:00:09.209> to<00:00:09.240> get<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.600> this

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
I've been really waiting to get to this

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
game Team Fortress 2 is probably the

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.670 
game Team Fortress 2 is probably the
best<00:00:12.029> online<00:00:12.420> FPS<00:00:12.600> for<00:00:12.959> the<00:00:13.020> PC<00:00:13.379> I've<00:00:13.529> ever

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
best online FPS for the PC I've ever

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.340 
best online FPS for the PC I've ever
played<00:00:14.010> there<00:00:14.850> are<00:00:15.000> two<00:00:15.180> game<00:00:15.420> types<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.199> can

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
played there are two game types you can

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.900 
played there are two game types you can
either<00:00:16.500> try<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> capture<00:00:17.039> points<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.640> capture

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
either try to capture points or capture

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.499 
either try to capture points or capture
the<00:00:17.939> flag

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
the flag

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.109 
the flag
both<00:00:19.109> are<00:00:19.289> fun<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.679> I'm<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:19.919> a<00:00:19.980> big<00:00:20.339> CTF<00:00:20.880> fan

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
both are fun but I'm not a big CTF fan

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.659 
both are fun but I'm not a big CTF fan
so<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.359> mostly<00:00:21.539> play<00:00:21.900> capture<00:00:22.199> points<00:00:22.830> upon

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
so I mostly play capture points upon

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:24.950 
so I mostly play capture points upon
entering<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> game<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.419> get<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> choice<00:00:24.779> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
entering the game you get a choice of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
entering the game you get a choice of
nine<00:00:25.169> different<00:00:25.529> classes<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.160> choose<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.369> II

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
nine different classes to choose from II

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.939 
nine different classes to choose from II
separated<00:00:27.210> into<00:00:27.419> three<00:00:27.749> categories<00:00:28.320> these

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
separated into three categories these

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
separated into three categories these
classes<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.789> different<00:00:30.089> strengths<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
classes all have different strengths and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
classes all have different strengths and
weaknesses<00:00:30.890> for<00:00:31.890> instance<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.489> Scout<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.060> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
weaknesses for instance the Scout is the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
weaknesses for instance the Scout is the
fastest<00:00:33.630> running<00:00:33.840> class<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.470> can<00:00:34.590> also<00:00:34.740> double

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
fastest running class he can also double

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.070 
fastest running class he can also double
jump<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.760> his<00:00:36.180> weapons<00:00:36.570> aren't<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.870> special

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
jump now his weapons aren't that special

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.890 
jump now his weapons aren't that special
so<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:37.800> isn't<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.310> good<00:00:38.490> of<00:00:38.640> an<00:00:38.760> attacker<00:00:39.090> now

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
so he isn't as good of an attacker now

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.170 
so he isn't as good of an attacker now

the heavy on the other hand has 300

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
the heavy on the other hand has 300
health<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> his<00:00:42.900> bullets<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.410> amazingly

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
health and his bullets are amazingly

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
health and his bullets are amazingly
powerful<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.060> only<00:00:45.240> problem<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.630> him<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> he

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
powerful the only problem with him is he

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
powerful the only problem with him is he

original<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:45.870> gave<00:04:46.080> them<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.350> ten<00:04:46.560> out<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.740> ten

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
original so I gave them a ten out of ten

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.190 
original so I gave them a ten out of ten
as<00:04:47.280> well<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.850> gameplay<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.780> gameplay<00:04:48.990> is

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
as well as the gameplay the gameplay is

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.220 
as well as the gameplay the gameplay is
fast<00:04:49.290> fun<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.010> addictive<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.690> theme<00:04:51.960> song

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
fast fun and addictive the theme song

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.780 
fast fun and addictive the theme song
and<00:04:52.440> sound<00:04:52.650> effects<00:04:52.920> were<00:04:53.100> great<00:04:53.370> but<00:04:53.610> there's

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
and sound effects were great but there's

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.820 
and sound effects were great but there's
an<00:04:53.910> incredibly<00:04:54.390> large<00:04:54.660> lack<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.260> music<00:04:55.650> during

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
an incredibly large lack of music during

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.580 
an incredibly large lack of music during
the<00:04:56.010> game<00:04:56.160> so<00:04:56.490> eight<00:04:56.760> out<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:56.940> ten<00:04:57.240> there

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the game so eight out of ten there

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.050 
the game so eight out of ten there
there's<00:04:58.590> no<00:04:58.740> need<00:04:58.920> for<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:59.220> replay<00:04:59.610> section

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060
