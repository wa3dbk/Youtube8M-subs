00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 hello welcome to this new course 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.280
 on the concept of color of objects 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.110
 so polluters wrote the land is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.670
 blue as an orange for the physicist 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.009
 to the physicist that you are this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 sentence can only challenge you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 must certainly ask you if she 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 has a physical reality or if they 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 only come from a reality 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.859
 poetic 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 so to answer this question 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.260
 proposes to address the notion of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 color 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 through three videos in this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.529
 first video we go we 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 interest in the notion of synthesis 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 additive and subtractive colors 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.340
 in a second video we will make a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 famous focus on the color of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.719
 objects or colors of objects and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.440
 Finally, we will focus on the vision of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.820
 colors before I talk about color I 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.350
 proposes to talk about light sources 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.520
 there are two types of sources of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 light the so-called light sources 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 primary producing their own 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.399
 light like the sun for example and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.750
 the secondary light sources that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.020
 do not produce their own light 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 but who returns who diffuses the light 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 that she typically receives is the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.590
 moon to see an object it must 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 the object issue or disseminate the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.799
 light and that this light emitted or 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 diffuse enters the eye of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.479
 the observer is that at that moment 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 that we can appreciate the color name of a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.939
 object then in general the sources of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.409
 light are sometimes a source of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.330
 white light typically as for 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.009
 the sun but is that light 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.799
 white is really a white light 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.250
 and well newton in one of his 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.560
 bestsellers called optics a 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.770
 describes one of the experiments so this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.090
 book he at 2704 he describes an experiment 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.009
 that he had realized some more time 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.880
 early on who the beast he described as 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.360
 crucial experience 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 so what is it about he sends the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.700
 sunlight on a prism and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 observe a figure on a screen so if 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 we do this experiment in the laboratory 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.570
 so by way of sun have put a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.940
 light source 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 here we have a prism like a newton and we 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.080
 observe on the screen a figure 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.000
 particular so here I made you a 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.950
 zoom is not very good quality 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.300
 can take a picture that was 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 obviously a little rigged but this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.070
 does not matter we observe a scope 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.260
 alain spectrum a figure with a whole 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.580
 color gamut remembers the spectrum 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.580
 of white light they say that light 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.590
 white has been broken down into a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.430
 magnificent city in an infinity of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 colors forgiveness by the prism 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.190
 so it's not a bag of experience 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.080
 newton has been crucial since this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.400
 decompression decomposition of the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 white light by a prism has been 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.570
 known for a very long time what has 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.570
 been crucial it is the result is that the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.500
 white light that he broke down 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.030
 he isolated just a color a light 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.400
 colored if we talk about radiation 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.560
 admit that it isolates through a 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.570
 small board is holed it isolates the 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.960
 red whose red light he's going 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.250
 isolated power it goes the scale is in 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.050
 a quotation marks on a second 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 prism and what do they find 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.150
 that the red light is just deflected 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.709
 but not broken down into other lights 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.130
 his skis to allow him to tell him that the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.790
 white light is a composition is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.959
 a sum of an infinity of colors 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.220
 the question we are going to increase is this 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.420
 that it really takes an infinity of 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.250
 colors to get a light 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.380
 white 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.790
 let's try to save a blue light and 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.060
 see in a green light and light 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.660
 red 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.930
 a yellow light if Some obtained 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.660
 a blue light and a green light 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.280
 we get light of sion if we want it 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.080
 to say a little bit that would be closer to the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.900
 turquoise word 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.140
 if we mix a red light and nîmes 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.810
 blue yesterday we get a light that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.630
 corresponds magenta and finally what is 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.980
 happens if we mix a light 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.980
 blue green and red 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.150
 so if we superimpose two of the lights to 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.950
 every time we get the lights 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.780
 still to write in advance but if 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.090
 the three are superimposed we get 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.010
 a white light so finally not 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.390
 worth it to have an hour before 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.320
 an infinity of colors to get 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.620
 a white light 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.300
 just superimpose three lights 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.930
 particular colored 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.750
 a blue light a green light a 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.360
 red light so just summon 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.200
 to add colored lights 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.150
 red green red green blue we will speak 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.630
 additive synthesis synthesis it wants 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.320
 say getting color by a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.690
 addition additive synthesis of colors 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.110
 then the question that would be legitimate 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.630
 now it would be how we get 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.150
 a colored light not for example to 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.190
 from a filters filter these are 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.620
 colorful transparent supports we see 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.720
 6 3 a red green blue filter we have 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.790
 understood in relation to the positive t1 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.950
 previous that it was key colors 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.990
 in the reasoning that what is 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.780
 switch to each of these filters 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.270
 on the path of white light 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.890
 and if we put a red filter on 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.630
 path of the white light we get 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.340
 good red 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.840
 if we put a blue-green filter on the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.820
 white light path we get a 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
 green light 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.800
 here we put to interpose a blue filter 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.140
 on a white light we get a 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.480
 blue light and so if ever we 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.180
 could sift the three colors 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.080
 green blue red between them if we 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.880
 can overlay them 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.750
 we get a light again 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.520
 white ultimate question to finish this 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.630
 capsule 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.030
 how to interpret obtaining a 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.830
 colored light from a filter and 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.240
 white light 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.340
 take a red filter for example one 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.320
 understood it a red filter does not 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.910
 lets pass that a red light like 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.350
 a green filter of the spa is that the 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.580
 green light and a blue filter 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.550
 lets pass that blue light 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.360
 in other words a filter do not leave 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.800
 pass the corresponding colored light 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.930
 to his own color 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.780
 so if we put a red filter on the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.150
 passage of white light we get 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.440
 a red light 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.630
 how can we interpret this phenomenon 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.590
 this observation simply by getting 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.140
 remembering that we can very well 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.850
 interpreted white light as a 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.610
 sum as an addition of three 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.730
 key lights a blue green light and 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.810
 red 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.790
 how can we explain so his 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.550
 simply observe by saying that the 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.950
 red filter to absorb some 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.960
 colored lights in this case the 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.330
 red filter to absorb green light 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.040
 to absorb the blue light he does not have 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.330
 let these two colors pass 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.060
 fundamental 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.630
 he adjusts his passes and passed it on 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.300
 Red light 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.550
 so we can also see in a way the 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.350
 thing we can say that the red filter has 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.470
 subtracts green light and light 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.720
 blue with white light transmitting 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.490
 so only the red light 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.920
 that's why we'll talk 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.590
 subtractive synthesis of colors on 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:55.350
 filter has subtracted absorb some 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.350
 colored lights with incident light
