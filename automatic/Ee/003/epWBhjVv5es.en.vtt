drive flexor cable from the bottom this

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.370 
drive flexor cable from the bottom this
may<00:02:32.620> also<00:02:32.800> be<00:02:33.070> stuck<00:02:33.340> down<00:02:33.610> too<00:02:34.390> we'll<00:02:35.080> need<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
may also be stuck down too we'll need to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.550 
may also be stuck down too we'll need to
remove<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.100> tape<00:02:36.370> from<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.480> cable

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.410 

once<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.489> done<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.880> should<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.180> able<00:02:46.270> to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
once this is done you should be able to

once this is done you should be able to
remove<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.989> drive<00:02:47.230> from<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.530> unit

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.710 

the<00:02:58.190> next<00:02:58.459> step<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:58.910> remove<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.239> battery

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the next step is to remove the battery

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.300 
the next step is to remove the battery
from<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.020> zune<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.860> should<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.040> be<00:03:01.220> able
