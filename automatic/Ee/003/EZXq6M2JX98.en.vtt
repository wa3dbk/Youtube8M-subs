hey there Martha with Renaissance art
and<00:00:39.320> I<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.620> wanted<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> talk<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
unique style of refillable journal that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
unique style of refillable journal that
we<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.700> hand<00:00:44.880> is<00:00:45.000> available<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.510> some

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
we have my hand is available in some

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.980 
we have my hand is available in some
different<00:00:45.810> sizes<00:00:46.380> and<00:00:47.570> anyway<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.840> are

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
different sizes and anyway here they are

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.940 
different sizes and anyway here they are
these<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.630> what<00:00:51.630> started<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.710> our

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
these are what started out as our

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.250 
these are what started out as our
children's<00:00:53.400> journals<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.030> changing<00:00:54.990> into

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
children's journals are changing into

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
children's journals are changing into
our<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.830> and<00:00:55.980> three<00:00:56.250> books<00:00:56.490> and<00:00:56.840> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
our one two and three books and the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
our one two and three books and the
reason<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.650> they<00:00:58.950> have<00:00:59.000> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
reason for that is because they have one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
reason for that is because they have one
individual<00:01:00.510> refill<00:01:01.040> to<00:01:02.040> individually

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
individual refill to individually

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.780 
individual refill to individually
removable<00:01:03.270> refills<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.960> three<00:01:04.350> refills<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
removable refills and three refills the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.670 
removable refills and three refills the
unique<00:01:05.970> thing<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.690> each

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
unique thing about them is that each

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680 
unique thing about them is that each
refill<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.610> removed<00:01:08.880> separately<00:01:09.479> so

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
refill can be removed separately so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.540 
refill can be removed separately so
they're<00:01:09.869> great<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.380> organization<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> I'll
