think if I go to a party or a club or

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.870 
think if I go to a party or a club or
something<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
basically all I have done already in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.560 
basically all I have done already in
this<00:00:39.809> tutorial<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.680> sort<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> basic<00:00:42.149> look

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this tutorial is a sort of basic look

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.030 
this tutorial is a sort of basic look
that<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:42.989> sort<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.440> maybe<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:43.890> an

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that I would sort of do maybe as an

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.560 
that I would sort of do maybe as an
everyday<00:00:44.399> look<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> literally<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
everyday look it's just literally a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
everyday look it's just literally a
black<00:00:45.899> cut<00:00:46.230> crease<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.770> normal<00:00:46.829> eyebrow

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
black cut crease with my normal eyebrow

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
black cut crease with my normal eyebrow
mystique<00:00:48.180> herself<00:00:48.600> doesn't<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> any

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
mystique herself doesn't have any

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
mystique herself doesn't have any
eyebrows<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.219> would<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.940> best

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
eyebrows so you would probably do best

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.939 
eyebrows so you would probably do best
to<00:00:51.390> either<00:00:51.570> cover<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.230> eyebrows<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.860> then

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to either cover your eyebrows and then

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
to either cover your eyebrows and then
cover<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> blue<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> didn't

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
cover them in blue but if you didn't

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.880 
cover them in blue but if you didn't
want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.350> could<00:00:55.469> always<00:00:55.649> get

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
want to do that you could always get

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
want to do that you could always get
maybe<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.370> white<00:00:56.730> mascara<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> blue<00:00:57.930> mascara

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
even looking because that's the little

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.490 
even looking because that's the little
thing<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.510> let<00:02:09.720> me<00:02:09.750> down<00:02:09.990> on<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.260> look<00:02:10.410> and

thing that let me down on this look and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
thing that let me down on this look and
I'm<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> bit<00:02:10.830> sort<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.070> upset<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.940> I'm<00:02:12.060> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
I'm a bit sort of upset so I'm just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm a bit sort of upset so I'm just
going<00:02:12.360> straight<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.110> I've<00:02:13.260> already

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
going straight in and I've already

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
going straight in and I've already
moistened<00:02:13.890> my<00:02:14.460> flat<00:02:15.090> head<00:02:15.270> brush<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.510> little

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
moistened my flat head brush a little

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.240 
moistened my flat head brush a little
bit<00:02:15.960> just<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.470> creates<00:02:16.800> much<00:02:16.950> more<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
bit just so it creates much more of a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.100 
bit just so it creates much more of a
sharper<00:02:17.700> line<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:18.630> putting<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.960> also

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
sharper line and I'm putting it also

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.600 
sharper line and I'm putting it also
down<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> neck<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.100> created<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.459> nice

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
down the neck and I just created a nice

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.780 
down the neck and I just created a nice
little<00:02:21.410> pointy<00:02:22.410> looking<00:02:22.770> effect<00:02:23.220> because<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
little pointy looking effect because I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.580 
little pointy looking effect because I
sort<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> think<00:02:24.180> mystique<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:24.540> quite<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.230> an

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
sort of think mystique has quite like an

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.530 
sort of think mystique has quite like an
aggressive<00:02:26.030> transformation<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.209> then<00:02:27.420> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
aggressive transformation and then I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.670 
aggressive transformation and then I
literally<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.080> fill<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.620> I've

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
literally just fill it in and I've

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.080 
literally just fill it in and I've
decided<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.130> cut<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.430> part<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.760> because

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
decided to cut this part out because

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.780 
decided to cut this part out because
filling<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> shadow<00:02:31.290> areas<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.670> bit

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
filling in a shadow areas a little bit

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.270

little<00:02:47.610> bit<00:02:47.820> more<00:02:47.850> aquamarine<00:02:48.750> than<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:48.959> would

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
little bit more aquamarine than I would

have liked but I still think it looks

have liked but I still think it looks
really<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.450> contour<00:02:51.989> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.170> top<00:02:52.440> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
really nice as a contour on the top of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.620

and I'm just going to start drawing

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.550 
and I'm just going to start drawing
scale<00:03:08.580> type<00:03:08.880> effects<00:03:09.269> onto<00:03:09.570> my<00:03:09.870> face<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.380> you

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
scale type effects onto my face as you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.870 
scale type effects onto my face as you
can<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> sort<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.640> really

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
can see I sort of do this in a really

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.400 
can see I sort of do this in a really
random<00:03:12.090> pattern<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:12.989> mystique<00:03:13.380> has

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
random pattern because mystique has

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.800 
random pattern because mystique has
quite<00:03:13.890> like<00:03:14.100> unusual<00:03:14.730> shapes<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.720> go

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
quite like unusual shapes that just go

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.540 
quite like unusual shapes that just go
around<00:03:15.930> her<00:03:16.350> face<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.830> problem<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.459> this

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
around her face the problem is that this

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.430 
around her face the problem is that this
blue<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.000> doesn't<00:03:18.180> exactly<00:03:18.510> match<00:03:18.870> perfectly

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
blue it doesn't exactly match perfectly

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.920 
blue it doesn't exactly match perfectly
either<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.070> I'm<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> bit<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.640> not<00:03:20.910> knowing<00:03:21.750> but

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
either so I'm a bit like not knowing but

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.120 
either so I'm a bit like not knowing but
I<00:03:22.019> still<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.500> works<00:03:22.680> quite<00:03:22.800> well

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
I still think it works quite well

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.710 
I still think it works quite well
in<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> end<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.150> what<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.360> want<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.600> do

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
in the end so then what you want to do

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.960
