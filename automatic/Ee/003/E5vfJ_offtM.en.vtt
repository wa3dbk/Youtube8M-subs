00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:10.410
 Fair Week Day today 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:16.049
 Today, I will give an overview of the entrance exam examination program at the Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University . 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.610
 Reverse is called the Kyutei national university visions First of all I Overview of Osaka University, Osaka 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:28.110
 It is just one of the high public and public universities that has high tradition and style. 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:35.590
 Referred to as the University of the top class in the next all aspects to Oite Kyoto University in the Kansai region 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:41.690
 The place of employment is also the largest number when speaking of representatives such as Sharp Toyota Motors Electronics Osaka Gas 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 If you are thinking to work in the Kansai region say that people of different Ma go away 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:55.430
 Also, in recent years, the title is Osaka University Future Talk 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:01:01.480
 Toshio Hirano president of Osaka University is the experiences of the research activities of its own in front of about 340 people including students faculty 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:08.480
 You say that the University of the domestic top-class research institutions such as the talk 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 Next is the outline of the talks with the basics, but there is a US Department of Physics and Science in Osaka University 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.080
 Department of Applied Chemistry 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.060
 Department of Systems Science Information Science There are four 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.690
 Electronic physical chemistry 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.010
 Chemistry 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.909
 Mechanical chemistry 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.950
 Biotechnology 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.950
 Unlike in the Faculty of Engineering, such as Physiological Chemistry, you can learn about Yorii theory 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:43.480
 You can obtain a junior high school high school teaching license qualification by going around the barbaric process twice during university 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.970
 Next is about the passing double play, but next to around from a comprehensive double play 60 63 rule of thumb in the art star 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.450
 I will 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.450
 Mark exam is also required to take 60 honors 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:01.500
 Lastly, about the type and measures of entrance examination 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 You will pass if you take about 560 points in total of the second examination of the Center Test Building 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 It was 530 points in 2013, but is good 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 2012 how re-experience may exceed 600 points 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.030
 And the aim will be to the fact that take 60% in total 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:25.700
 80% of center exams, considering center and second degree of difficulty 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:29.600
 Take 240 points and take about 50% of 360 points in the secondary test 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.810
 This is the strategy that many people take 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.750
 On the other hand, I take 80% of the center exam 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:45.130
 It is difficult considering the examination schedule and concentration, etc. How high is the secondary test with a point allocation 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.760
 It is a scratch test. It will be a lesson whether you practice so that you can take points with this 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.030
 There are no 300 secondary exams in the center test. 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.610
 It is a test of Sumo secondary test weight 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.610
 Let's emphasize the third measure not the center measure 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:09.270
 It is a feature that physical examination is essential in qi examination about basic engineering department 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.250
 English math thoroughly in the stage of high school first grader second grader 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.250
 Let me avoid learning in less time 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.800
 Japanese language and society are not late even after being in high school 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.840
 875 out of 1000 points 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.140
 English mathematics science 2 account for 87.5% 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:36.370
 About 90% of learning should be devoted to strengthening for small farmers 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:42.390
 Closes 625 points by the side system especially in math and science 2 subjects 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.390
 In other words , 62.5% of the background corresponds to about 60% 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:53.710
 If you can cultivate overwhelming power in math and science 2 subjects and have strong ability in English 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:58.210
 Referred to as the national language and society can pass even if suitably flow 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:04.240
 More than half of the study will be devoted to mathematics and science two subjects 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.750
 Instead of doing that, too, doing selective learning and strategically learning with a sticky attitude 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.440
 But 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.510
 It is the shortest distance to the direction of Osaka University Faculty of Engineering 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.799
 Let's see another video for specific environmental measures 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.799
 Thank you for listening
