00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello you dearly 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.110
 such a short video and though thought 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.600
 I'll show you one like that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 Quicktipp from me I have now synonymous 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.619
 not yet done but I have recently 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180
 a product discovered in the drugstore something 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.619
 I was very enthusiastic and wanted that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.560
 I introduce you very briefly as 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 short little tip to you from the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 drogerie and that is it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.019
 a russ i was for me now 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.699
 after discovering it with them 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.660
 outside on the block have discovered 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.790
 I say I constantly discovered and that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.129
 is guided by this rouge live 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.739
 cherry is from essen- and that is now 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 Also in the new location I have assortment 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.820
 the other day discovered in an exhibitor 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 by essence where the things only the new 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.120
 items from the standard range 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.159
 were presented 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.949
 and I was very excited about it yes and 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.280
 Although the only touch is in the color 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.369
 live cherry number 60 and you get 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.049
 the good part for two euros 49 and that 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.869
 I think it's a great deal for five 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.000
 gram rouge and i have to say i am 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.220
 yes, that's what I'm always so 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 direction high end or mac on the way 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 because I just like the quality 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.440
 appreciate and that there is one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.660
 drogerie did not really find it 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.970
 I've been in the last two years 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.560
 the more I love this rouge 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
 because that's really what I would do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 as cherry red designate a red with 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
 clear pink impact and it has 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 also really beautiful shimmer and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.130
 i think the dik the texture is scary 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.690
 silky and do not you know it now 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 looks like that 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.980
 and yes it is just a very 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.020
 intense color it quiet what also what you 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.070
 stories can now what where now 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.180
 maybe first a bit 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.010
 be careful but I think 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.330
 actually with a slight dosage 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.590
 that looks a bit puffy 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 really nice I wear it too 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.040
 just 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.020
 and yes it really got me right 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.520
 cut down the silky texture is right 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 beautiful can blend very well 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 really blends with the skin 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.530
 and for the price I think it's 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.240
 unbeatable do not live like that for a long time 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 been surprised and so positive 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.989
 impressed by a slip and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.489
 because I think that's great the color 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.780
 also really nice so now is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.340
 Although a bit bang I have more often 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.040
