00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:21.390
 I do not need to take the rabbit away 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:22.920
 flee carpet forward hello everyone with 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 you authorities today we will continue to do 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.730
 Minecraft mods reviews 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 adds magic carpets which 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 allow you to soar up let's 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730
 let's begin by tradition with crafting ours 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 Crafting items are pretty straightforward. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 given carpets 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.420
 everyone has their own color but 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 items the same in total gold 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 ingots on the sides and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.719
 the thread in the middle then the wool goes but 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 wool is already dependent on what color 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 carpet you want to create let's say we 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.020
 want to create a brown carpet correctly 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.800
 so we put brown 6 along with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 black wool 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
 if we want to create a red carpet 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 we need to put red wool black 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 wool blue carpet blue and red 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.110
 wool and green carpet green and yellow 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 wool I think that everything is clear 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 and craffin pretty simple nothing 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.799
 difficult now what can we do with them 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.369
 actually we can do them 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.229
 spread out 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.750
 and make our room a little house in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.549
 which we live much cozier let's say 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.159
 right click we just throw 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.780
 roll to the ground then click left 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.090
 click and thus it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 Turning wala isn't it great 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 but agree it is much better than 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.610
 just let the wool pieces be hammered in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.979
 the ground well it's already much cooler much 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.259
 cozier in the end let's decompose 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 Now the rest of the carpets and see how 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.100
 they will look 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.369
 and they look in my opinion very much 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.799
 good and beautiful and so is the last carpet 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.780
 Well, something like this is all it will be 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.340
 look like your house if you decompose and 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 so now we can with them 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 really do if u have 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.579
 present rolls are present you also 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 can take them back left click 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.770
 click on them and right click 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.380
 the mouse on his own 5 this roll he 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.390
 bounced aside we lifted him and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 now he is present in our inventory 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.660
 then you can enchant him and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.430
 make a magic carpet 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.270
 to enchant you to any carpet 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.180
 You need one of these three things as well 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.910
 more precisely ifrite rod enchanted 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.520
 book or experience bubble I already like 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.220
 the fact is that he give us some 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 option some sort of choice between subjects 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 what we want to deliver because and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.070
 sky let's say 1 definitely an example well 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.900
 it's a pancake but when we have 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.450
 several choices then this is already a lot 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 best overall you put one of these 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.220
 any three items along with your 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.920
 any color carpet and get 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 enchanted carpet that principle is very 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.880
 and great now they are present with me 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.010
 in inventory after which you also him 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.200
 laid out on the ground let's say it 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.110
 well, not red, we will fly to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.050
 red today we throw it on the ground and 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.090
 we see that it is covered with a small one 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.430
 golden glitter that principle is very 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.140
 great also expand it click 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.080
 left click on it over this 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.400
 most roll and voila here it is small 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.410
 Animation harmonica damn just super 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.750
 start sparkles sparkling out of him and he 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.910
 besides to cover with gold color in general 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.130
 I just have all the magic 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.820
 like + he takes off the ground at 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.730
 half a meter 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.410
 which means that he is ready what 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.810
 means that we can sit on it and 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.080
 fly click the right mouse button and 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.510
 voila you are already on it yours and take in 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.790
 Generally you sit and joke in the fact that 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.060
 carpet caring actually you can 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.730
 notice that character's dad 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.170
 present a small pillow 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.480
 comfortable and cozy 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.250
 generally gorgeous let's see what we 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.800
 we can do with the help of this carpet 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.660
 can fly and it's very cool even 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.480
 jump from long distances 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.900
 I mean from high altitude also data 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.910
 carpets actually float and this 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.520
 also very cool to me too it is very 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.470
 liked it but it 's not all using 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.200
 carpet data you can take off 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.360
 take off high high in general to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.760
 take off you click on the space bar 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.160
 here is a small incident the fact is that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.989
 with space you jump 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.570
 so you can not use the space 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.729
 as a takeoff so you will need 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.290
 find in management 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:31.620
 key called magic carps jump 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.080
 what does magical carpet leap in 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.240
 overall i set: ashamed because u 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.190
 me all the rest are clogged you put 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.130
 any your free key after which 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.680
 click ready go back to the game and 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.780
 actually click on this key and 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.110
 you may notice how sharply literally 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.070
 dramatically the carpet is off the ground and 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.720
 lift you up to heaven 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.580
 that's just really 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.470
 wonderful magic straight soar e-mine 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.139
 and here these sparkles what sensation not 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.660
 attached basically i told you everything by 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.400
 about this mod to pick up this 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.460
 carpet you do the same thing just 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.220
 peel off after which click on 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.650
 you left mouse button it collapses 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.530
 again like harmonica with by the way 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.600
 damn it's great he rolls himself 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.550
 the sun is set why are we at all 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.430
 need in this game everything is done here 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.990
 myself from this kidding after which again 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.479
 right click on one 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.979
 rolls and walya jumps on the side and 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.440
 we take it to our inventory 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.610
 that's the principle and everyone works like that 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.950
 other carpets 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.860
 in the same way they are laid out exactly 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.130
 they also act and everything I think 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.919
 that we ended up with this mod and he 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.169
 just great if you liked 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.450
 why don't you rate the video i think that 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.050
 it's a good idea plus write any 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.660
