00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi hello all of you a long time ago 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.580
 I'm not a videos and this video I wanted 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.030
 do and for a long time but good 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 I had been a little indisposed and good 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 for that reason I will not be able to make videos 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.539
 but I'm already here I want to show you a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.589
 idea that I have already tried 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:28.470
 that works and that is a myth that does not 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.470
 You can make yourself a willys with 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 the finish 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.640
 if it works so what we have to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.920
 doing is relatively very easy this is 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.359
 simply adding that the end 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.359
 some a glass 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.210
 to help us to be able to mix 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.250
 I'm thinking of any end and if I'm 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.250
 using a color that I like a lot 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 any enamel 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.110
 after being the enamel that you want 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.230
 that you have in your house 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.730
 this 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.720
 all we have to do is 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.720
 just give it color 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.970
 that a part is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.760
 and a part be d 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.490
 than normal 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.680
 then let's do here what I'm going to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.680
 use to stir it is a 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 some easy 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.930
 Now let's solve it with these 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.190
 that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 it's a pretty economical brush 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:51.070
 excuse my nails, there was not exactly 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.710
 been putting trying to try new 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.800
 new technical colors because I've been 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.840
 having problems with my fingers I'm 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.460
 being allergic to some products and good 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.110
 I'm on medication so I can not 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 paint my nails I will not do anything here 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.090
 you can see some injuries that I've 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.590
 had and this but is already improving 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 Well then, this is basic 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.690
 what we will do is return it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.260
 to achieve the homogeneous mixture 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.530
 since we have the mixture that simply 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.770
 we apply it on the nail how it is applied 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.200
 this applies to the nail that already 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.740
 is prepared previously that is to say and to 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.000
 we encourage the infected and run 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.530
 cuticle go to the basic steps to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.030
 psyche applications and not knowing which ones 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 are the basic steps if by chance 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.760
 they came across to go with my channel what 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.360
 can do is go further back I have a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.740
 video where he explained the way in which 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.310
 we prepare the one correctly for 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.830
 can apply gels and go that's the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.730
 right way then this is very 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.269
 simple we simply apply 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.269
 we apply it 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:18.230
 let's apply layer by layer these are 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.300
 that applying them in many many layers does not 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.480
 we're just going to apply two because the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.390
 thin gel stretches to break then what 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.980
 can be here I'm apply some is 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.990
 enough we have to apply so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.110
 less about five layers to give it hardness 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.910
 and that the electric chelis the finish 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.200
 can grab 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.860
 hardness firmness do not split this is not going 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.810
 starting 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.490
 I already tried it on myself on my nails 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.330
 natural and has already been approximately 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.400
 about 10 days and it worked perfect but 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.390
 the problem is that the finish 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.470
 It can not be removed with 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.470
 how are we going to put 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.160
 i 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.990
 the only problem is that this does not 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.870
 you can put that is can not be removed 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.239
 with 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.239
 with acetone so good 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.910
 what we have to do the only way 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.770
 to remove it is filming smoothly and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.840
 we can take this away we can serve 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.100
 for when we do not have the resources to 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.890
 buy them all the colors that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.420
 we want the colors of james are very 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.880
 expensive and well this can be the 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.960
 perfect then I will give several layers 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.960
 and let's see how it is 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.640
 here I put more or less four layers 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.620
 just to show you in the nails is 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.540
 It is recommended that you make it about five or 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.120
 six times I did it are very layers 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.220
 thin to go giving the color and strength 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.980
 and really, the nails do not break 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.660
 they do not crack they do not crash they last 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.670
 that has to last clear you have to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:01.210
 take care because it is that the end is the end and 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.210
 if it's a little more fragile than 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.650
 They are as plastic as 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.630
 how are chiles and good simply 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.220
 want to try me Achilles in the lid more 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.289
 of films at the end, it only remains to give 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.159
 shine as you can see 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.159
 they look very good 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.800
 Really 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.419
 its a color 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.539
 of a glaze and can you do 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.550
 many combinations and nothing simply 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.919
 with three things we can do some 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.229
 quick lines at home and good if you 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.770
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe and 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.220
 I like him share some friends and 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.220
 See you soon
