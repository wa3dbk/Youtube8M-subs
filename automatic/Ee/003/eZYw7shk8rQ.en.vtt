so<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.530> looks<00:00:53.770> too<00:00:54.130> big<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.640> be<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.820> single

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
so it looks too big to be a single

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.870 
so it looks too big to be a single
infected<00:00:55.900> hair<00:00:56.230> follicle<00:00:56.800> but<00:00:57.460> could<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.730> be

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
infected hair follicle but could it be

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.400 
infected hair follicle but could it be
several<00:00:58.450> like<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:59.370> certainly<00:01:00.370> possible<00:01:00.580> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
several like this certainly possible a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.010 
several like this certainly possible a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
steroids it's spread to several

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
steroids it's spread to several
follicles<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:07.570> downright<00:01:08.380> nasty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
