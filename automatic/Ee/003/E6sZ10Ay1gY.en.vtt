away<00:00:45.350> from<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.739> wheel<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.129> can<00:00:46.309> pull

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
away from the wheel so you can pull

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.549 
away from the wheel so you can pull
yourself<00:00:46.850> along<00:00:46.940> more<00:00:47.420> efficiently<00:00:47.809> downhill

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
yourself along more efficiently downhill

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.020 
yourself along more efficiently downhill
I<00:00:48.589> can<00:00:48.830> really<00:00:48.979> get<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.250> going<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.640> can<00:00:49.820> really

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
I can really get it going you can really

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.789 
I can really get it going you can really
kind<00:00:50.150> of<00:00:50.239> get<00:00:50.390> some<00:00:50.570> speed<00:00:50.809> up<00:00:50.839> and<00:00:51.229> it

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
kind of get some speed up and it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.229 
kind of get some speed up and it
generates<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.309> more<00:00:52.430> efficient<00:00:52.850> kind<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.120> way

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
generates a more efficient kind of way

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.110

it's important to Steve to keep fit and
an<00:01:07.790> audio<00:01:08.119> system<00:01:08.479> gives<00:01:08.990> him<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.380> superb

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
an audio system gives him a superb

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.730 
an audio system gives him a superb
cardiovascular<00:01:11.210> workout<00:01:11.659> well<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.500> often

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
cardiovascular workout well it often

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.349 
cardiovascular workout well it often
uses<00:01:12.860> different<00:01:13.159> muscle<00:01:13.460> groups<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.969> know

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
uses different muscle groups you know

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.120 
uses different muscle groups you know
you're<00:01:14.509> kind<00:01:14.689> of<00:01:14.719> pull<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.049> two<00:01:15.619> using<00:01:15.799> car

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
you're kind of pull in two using car

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.980 
you're kind of pull in two using car
muscles<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.180> different<00:01:17.210> way<00:01:17.509> when<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.810> push

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
muscles in a different way when you push

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.959 
muscles in a different way when you push
in<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.039> is<00:01:19.130> actually<00:01:19.310> more<00:01:19.520> efficient<00:01:19.880> at

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
in but it is actually more efficient at

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.580 
in but it is actually more efficient at
the<00:01:20.060> same<00:01:20.210> time<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.810> know<00:01:21.200> getting<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.439> good

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the same time so you know getting a good

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.810 
the same time so you know getting a good
workout<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:22.219> know<00:01:22.340> actually<00:01:22.399> putting<00:01:22.759> as

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
workout but you know actually putting as

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.359 
workout but you know actually putting as
much<00:01:22.939> effort<00:01:23.479> into<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.109> so<00:01:24.469> yeah<00:01:25.039> it's<00:01:25.189> kind<00:01:25.280> of

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
much effort into it so yeah it's kind of

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.569 
much effort into it so yeah it's kind of
a<00:01:25.549> win-win<00:01:26.240> situation<00:01:26.570> running<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.920> patented

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
that the disc brake and the sprocket

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.039 
that the disc brake and the sprocket
system<00:01:55.249> is<00:01:55.490> bolted<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.030> frame<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.929> we

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
system is bolted to the frame and we

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.480 
system is bolted to the frame and we
then<00:01:57.200> have<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.560> nord<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.829> go<00:01:57.950> lever<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:58.399> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
then have the nord to go lever with the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.730 
then have the nord to go lever with the
chain<00:01:58.729> here<00:01:59.060> so<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> chain<00:01:59.990> engages<00:02:00.499> with<00:02:00.619> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
chain here so the chain engages with the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.679 
chain here so the chain engages with the
sprocket<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.399> then<00:02:01.670> turns<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.149> wheel<00:02:02.299> so

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
sprocket and then turns the wheel so

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.389 
sprocket and then turns the wheel so
it's<00:02:02.810> like<00:02:02.929> a<00:02:02.960> bike<00:02:03.259> yes<00:02:03.859> similar<00:02:04.249> to<00:02:04.369> a

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
it's like a bike yes similar to a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.910 
it's like a bike yes similar to a
bicycle<00:02:04.579> yeah<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.450> how<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.530> wheelchair

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
bicycle yeah and how is the wheelchair

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.010 
bicycle yeah and how is the wheelchair
be<00:02:07.039> received<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:08.149> Nordic<00:02:08.450> go<00:02:08.539> system<00:02:08.899> has

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
be received the Nordic go system has

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.990 
be received the Nordic go system has
been<00:02:09.140> very<00:02:09.200> well<00:02:09.560> received<00:02:09.590> we've<00:02:10.550> taken<00:02:10.850> it
