yourself and so I hope that you know
that<00:03:39.380> they<00:03:39.890> were<00:03:39.980> continue<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.370> be<00:03:40.459> more<00:03:40.670> kind

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
that they were continue to be more kind

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.580

of complicated interesting characters

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.960

few<00:05:55.919> years<00:05:56.220> with<00:05:56.550> you<00:05:56.850> know<00:05:56.970> gay<00:05:57.600> marriage<00:05:57.810> and

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
few years with you know gay marriage and

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.050 
few years with you know gay marriage and
with<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.410> Obama<00:05:58.680> administration<00:05:59.310> so<00:05:59.820> do<00:05:59.940> you

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
with the Obama administration so do you

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.880 
with the Obama administration so do you
think<00:06:00.090> that<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.900> people<00:06:01.320> that<00:06:01.530> are<00:06:01.560> viewing

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
think that the people that are viewing

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.770 
think that the people that are viewing
this<00:06:02.010> now<00:06:02.280> or<00:06:02.580> maybe<00:06:02.790> more<00:06:03.060> open-minded<00:06:03.390> than

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
this now or maybe more open-minded than

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.820 
this now or maybe more open-minded than
they<00:06:03.990> would<00:06:04.110> have<00:06:04.140> been<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.380> few<00:06:04.590> years<00:06:04.620> ago

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
they would have been a few years ago

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.670 
they would have been a few years ago
when<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.310> was<00:06:05.340> first<00:06:05.640> released<00:06:06.200> I<00:06:07.200> think

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
when it was first released I think

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.230 
when it was first released I think
there's<00:06:07.890> been<00:06:07.950> a<00:06:08.190> lot<00:06:08.490> of<00:06:08.520> discussion<00:06:09.060> there's

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
there's been a lot of discussion there's

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.790 
there's been a lot of discussion there's
look<00:06:09.540> there's<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.780> lot<00:06:09.930> more<00:06:09.960> visibility<00:06:10.470> about

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
look there's a lot more visibility about

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.280 
look there's a lot more visibility about
LGBT<00:06:11.340> rights<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.790> know<00:06:11.850> Hillary<00:06:12.750> Clinton

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
LGBT rights you know Hillary Clinton

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.750 
LGBT rights you know Hillary Clinton
just<00:06:13.440> gave<00:06:13.560> a<00:06:13.590> speech<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.040> UN<00:06:14.250> there's

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
just gave a speech to the UN there's

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.310 
just gave a speech to the UN there's
really<00:06:14.880> important<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:15.510> so<00:06:15.900> I<00:06:15.930> think<00:06:16.020> it's

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
really important and so I think it's

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.390 
really important and so I think it's
something<00:06:16.440> people<00:06:16.620> are<00:06:16.770> talking<00:06:17.070> about<00:06:17.130> more

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
something people are talking about more

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.320 
something people are talking about more
and<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:17.640> think<00:06:17.850> it's<00:06:17.970> something<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.300> people

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
and I think it's something that people

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.450 
and I think it's something that people
talking<00:06:18.780> about<00:06:18.870> cross<00:06:19.169> communities<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.860> don't

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
talking about cross communities I don't

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.710 
talking about cross communities I don't
know<00:06:20.700> that<00:06:20.880> there's<00:06:20.940> a<00:06:21.120> difference<00:06:21.479> and<00:06:21.660> you

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
know that there's a difference and you

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.990 
know that there's a difference and you
know<00:06:21.930> this<00:06:22.560> film<00:06:22.890> being<00:06:23.130> able<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.430> happen<00:06:23.550> now

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
know this film being able to happen now

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.969 
know this film being able to happen now
versus<00:06:24.660> you<00:06:24.840> know<00:06:24.870> five<00:06:25.169> six<00:06:25.380> years<00:06:25.440> ago<00:06:25.620> I

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
versus you know five six years ago I

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.980 
versus you know five six years ago I

think that you know what we're seeing is

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.780 
think that you know what we're seeing is
that<00:06:28.020> audiences<00:06:28.740> you<00:06:28.979> know<00:06:29.100> have<00:06:29.250> been<00:06:29.370> hungry
