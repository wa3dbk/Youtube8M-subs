here<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.620> could<00:00:50.039> get<00:00:50.250> away<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> repair<00:00:51.090> like

here I could get away with a repair like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.160 
here I could get away with a repair like
this<00:00:52.039> because<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.340> using<00:00:53.670> red<00:00:54.149> tape<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> red

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
this because I'm using red tape on a red

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.520 
this because I'm using red tape on a red
lens<00:00:56.239> don't<00:00:57.239> try<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.629> take<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.199> Mickey
