00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
you could come up with a million

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.900

theories about what Lupe is doing on
here<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.360> that's<00:05:42.660> what<00:05:42.810> makes<00:05:42.990> it<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.290> great

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
here and that's what makes it so great

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.670 
here and that's what makes it so great
that<00:05:44.280> said<00:05:44.640> for<00:05:45.210> some<00:05:45.480> people<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:46.050> think<00:05:46.530> this

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
that said for some people I think this

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.890 
that said for some people I think this
album<00:05:46.890> might<00:05:47.280> be<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.490> little<00:05:47.970> bit<00:05:48.120> too<00:05:48.300> much<00:05:48.540> and

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
album might be a little bit too much and

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.690 
album might be a little bit too much and
at<00:05:49.320> times<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.830> might<00:05:49.980> feel<00:05:50.160> like<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:50.370> chore

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
at times it might feel like a chore

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.090 
at times it might feel like a chore
trying<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.540> understand<00:05:52.110> Lupe's<00:05:52.560> history

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
trying to understand Lupe's history

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.370 
trying to understand Lupe's history
lessons<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.760> all<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.180> his<00:05:54.300> crazy<00:05:54.660> references

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
lessons and all of his crazy references

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.710 
lessons and all of his crazy references
but<00:05:55.950> it's<00:05:56.070> also<00:05:56.280> still<00:05:56.790> a<00:05:56.820> very<00:05:57.240> accessible

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
but it's also still a very accessible

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.290 
but it's also still a very accessible
album<00:05:58.350> because<00:05:58.950> of<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.190> production<00:05:59.790> and<00:05:59.940> the

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
album because of the production and the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.060 
album because of the production and the
catchy<00:06:00.510> hooks<00:06:00.900> so<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.290> don't<00:06:01.530> think<00:06:01.710> it's<00:06:01.830> too

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
catchy hooks so I don't think it's too

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.920 
catchy hooks so I don't think it's too
far<00:06:02.370> out<00:06:02.580> there<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.000> everybody<00:06:03.600> should<00:06:03.720> be

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
far out there and everybody should be

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.510 
far out there and everybody should be
able<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.140> get<00:06:04.260> some<00:06:04.560> sort<00:06:04.830> of<00:06:04.860> enjoyment<00:06:05.190> out

other discussion but I think his overall

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.620 
other discussion but I think his overall
execution<00:06:31.320> with<00:06:31.770> this<00:06:31.920> album<00:06:32.250> was<00:06:32.640> fantastic

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
and Tetsuo when youth could ease

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.530 
and Tetsuo when youth could ease
be<00:06:36.020> argued<00:06:36.470> as<00:06:36.620> his<00:06:36.980> best<00:06:37.250> album<00:06:37.670> so<00:06:38.120> I<00:06:38.150> give<00:06:38.420> it
