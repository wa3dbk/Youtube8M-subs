00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.860
 Welcome to the startup tiger 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.389
 Today I'll show you how to do such a thing 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.250
 classic origami sakura folds 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.800
 For that we need a simple piece 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.199
 origami paper and we start by 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.740
 we put the tip down on the top of the top 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.740
 wrinkles 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.300
 Then we open the fold again and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.110
 now fold the top right onto the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 lace left 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 then open this posture again 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.350
 and that stays on the backside 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:00.660
 now the edge from below on the edge 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:03.180
 from above, open the bar again 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.199
 and now the edge from the right to the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.199
 Keep the edge from the left 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.120
 and also the game opens now lead 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.460
 we point the two right and left in 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.760
 the middle together and just press 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 front and back the leaves on so that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.560
 this form arises 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.090
 Now we put it all down that way 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.200
 the open side is down as 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.160
 Next, the edges on the right 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.160
 Axis line case 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.540
 the same could be done with the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 left side on the audi on the center line 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.200
 wrinkles 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.880
 the triangle above is above now 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.530
 short to the back or forward 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.490
 stop and stand up again 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.860
 We're going to do the same thing now 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.540
 the back also here we hold these 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.540
 edges towards the center line 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.880
 right and left 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.910
 Now we can leave the two here 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.700
 open again and the tip from below 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.650
 pull up and in the form of the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.390
 then we will keep that up 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.840
 really stuck again so that after 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.510
 above 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.630
 a sharp triangle gives the whole 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.770
 looks the same we do 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.770
 also on the back 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.580
 Here we open the tabs and pull 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.580
 the top up 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.950
 unfold the whole then in this form 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.950
 firmly 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.579
 after we did that we stop 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.579
 the upper tip up to the middle down 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 knew well keep the whole again 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.480
 open the tabs on the right and 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.099
 open the left and the point in the middle 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.099
 to praise into it 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.629
 the whole thing looks the same 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.599
 Step we now also repeat 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:49.170
 the back here too the tip up 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.769
 to medium after round folds well 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.810
 fold it all the way up again 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.209
 the two bottles right and left 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:05.250
 open and tip down into the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:08.989
 drive in the middle now like leaves 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.989
 around on both sides 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.660
 so 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.859
 and repeat the same steps 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.460
 again here also the triangle 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.699
 the tip folds up again 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:30.639
 to the middle down fold well 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:33.650
 Open fold open the two tabs 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.580
 and the point in the middle 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 wrinkles 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.970
 We will do the same again here 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.789
 on the back here again the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.710
 tip up to the half after 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:59.409
 hold down if good follow suit 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.360
 open the two leaving open and 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.360
 fold the lace into the middle 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.000
 Now we can bloom the individual 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.669
 fold sheets away for reasons 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.370
 then warns on the back then 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.370
 in turn leaves for even the pages 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.110
 fold down below 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.000
 thereby arise at this form we 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.490
 turn the whole thing so that the top 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.460
 shows up and now we rejuvenate 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:41.780
 the point by putting this edge on the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:44.270
 middle fold the same also on the 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.690
 left side this edge on the middle 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.690
 wrinkles 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.800
 we turn the whole object again now 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.240
 on the back and repeat the 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.960
 namely , this edge on 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.960
 to fold the middle 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:03.740
 here again we fall to the left 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.440
 could also be the middle after we did that 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.789
 we have kept the resulting 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.660
 pointed forward and upward so high as 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.520
 hold on tight here 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.380
 if we can do that we can 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.900
 that really turn up and all 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.900
 Carefully open the petals 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.340
 Now our cherry blossom is almost 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.590
 All we have to do is finish it 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.590
 leaves up something on the side 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:54.379
 and finished is our origami 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:56.719
 sakura much joy during stop 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:59.019
 and see you next time at mister tip 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.019
