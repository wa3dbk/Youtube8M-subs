surprisingly and he gets really tanky

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
surprisingly and he gets really tanky
he's<00:00:30.390> also<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> very<00:00:31.109> unique<00:00:31.830> passive

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
he's also got a very unique passive

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
he's also got a very unique passive
which<00:00:32.520> allows<00:00:32.759> him<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.079> lane<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.380> well<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which allows him to lane really well and

which allows him to lane really well and
jungle<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:35.969> he's<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.360> good

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

champion<00:00:37.140> overall<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.620> he<00:00:38.160> really

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
champion overall I think he really

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
champion overall I think he really
deserves<00:00:38.670> more<00:00:38.850> respect<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.270> he<00:00:39.390> gets<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.110> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
deserves more respect and he gets so if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.209 
deserves more respect and he gets so if

think he's really fun he's got a pretty
simple<00:02:09.420> kit<00:02:09.750> basically<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.590> jump<00:02:10.890> on

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
simple kit basically you just jump on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
simple kit basically you just jump on
and<00:02:11.190> use<00:02:11.310> everything<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.790> once<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.270> pray

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and use everything all once and pray

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.680 
and use everything all once and pray
that<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.750> blow<00:02:12.959> them<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
that you blow them up so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.570 
that you blow them up so
it<00:02:13.990> works<00:02:14.380> really<00:02:14.530> well<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.370> too
