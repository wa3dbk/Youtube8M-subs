00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
really fun title it's difficult to kind

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
really fun title it's difficult to kind
of<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.180> title<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.750> similar<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
of think that a title that's similar to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
of think that a title that's similar to
this<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.340> closest<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> could<00:01:03.120> think

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this and the closest one I could think

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.380 
this and the closest one I could think
of<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.719> mass<00:01:03.960> effect<00:01:05.060> this<00:01:06.060> effect

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of was mass effect this effect

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
of was mass effect this effect
infiltrator<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.290> called<00:01:07.549> released

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
infiltrator I think it's called released

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
infiltrator I think it's called released
last<00:01:08.850> year<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> year<00:01:09.450> before<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:10.080> very

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
last year or the year before a very

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
last year or the year before a very
similar<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.640> moving

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
similar kind of thing just moving

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179 
similar kind of thing just moving
between<00:01:12.240> cover<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> title<00:01:13.979> doesn't

fifty<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.790> Play<00:01:44.939> Store<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.329> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
fifty I think on the Play Store so it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.999 
fifty I think on the Play Store so it's
a<00:01:45.479> fairly<00:01:45.689> premium<00:01:46.140> title<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> point

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
a fairly premium title from that point

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
a fairly premium title from that point
of<00:01:47.130> view<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.540> bit<00:01:48.659> discouraged

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
which is a real shame really I think if

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
which is a real shame really I think if
I've<00:02:03.270> already<00:02:03.450> paid<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.020> title<00:02:04.290> then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
pay pay to win is a bit off but never

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.360 
pay pay to win is a bit off but never

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
this sort of led to believe um the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.820 
this sort of led to believe um the
developers<00:02:16.030> got<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.269> eat<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.440> think<00:02:17.709> that's

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
developers got to eat but I think that's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.630 
developers got to eat but I think that's
probably<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.159> are<00:02:18.220> they<00:02:18.310> only<00:02:18.430> major

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
probably what are they only major

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.059 
probably what are they only major
drawbacks<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.049> very<00:02:20.530> very<00:02:20.799> good

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069

drawbacks on what is a very very good
game<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.549> could<00:02:22.480> say<00:02:22.599> there<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.560> whole

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
game I could say there is this whole

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.800 
game I could say there is this whole
factor<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.819> will<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.120> buying<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.659> game

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.119

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
up again there's an awful lot of kind of

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
up again there's an awful lot of kind of
watching<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.049> learning<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.680> patterns<00:02:48.069> as

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
watching and learning the patterns as

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.280 
watching and learning the patterns as
well<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.569> enemies<00:02:49.840> on<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:49.989> screen<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
well and the enemies on the screen to

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.910 
well and the enemies on the screen to
kind<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.910> dodged<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.420> right<00:02:52.599> moment

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.250 

move<00:02:56.920> position<00:02:57.340> again<00:02:57.549> but<00:02:58.359> yeah<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.079> very

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
move position again but yeah it's a very

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
move position again but yeah it's a very
fun<00:02:59.560> title<00:02:59.829> is<00:03:00.040> epoch<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.640> think<00:03:00.970> it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
fun title is epoch I think it's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.009 
fun title is epoch I think it's
certainly<00:03:01.180> one<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.480> people<00:03:01.720> are<00:03:01.840> going<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
certainly one that people are going to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.509 
certainly one that people are going to
want<00:03:02.079> to<00:03:02.200> try<00:03:02.950> out<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:03.129> wouldn't<00:03:03.430> necessarily

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
want to try out I wouldn't necessarily

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.789 
want to try out I wouldn't necessarily
call<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.120> killer<00:03:04.420> title<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.500> galaxy

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
call it a killer title on the galaxy

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.559 
call it a killer title on the galaxy
note<00:03:05.829> 2<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.159> think<00:03:06.310> we've<00:03:06.549> had<00:03:07.030> those<00:03:07.209> already

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
note 2 I think we've had those already

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.899 
note 2 I think we've had those already
but<00:03:08.319> certainly<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.159> game<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.579> very

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
but certainly it's a game that is very

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.569 
but certainly it's a game that is very
pretty<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.480> look<00:03:10.629> at<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.709> as<00:03:12.129> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
pretty to look at and as you can see the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.309 
pretty to look at and as you can see the
frame<00:03:12.849> rate<00:03:13.060> just<00:03:13.690> solid<00:03:13.959> all<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.170> way

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
frame rate just solid all the way

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.030 
frame rate just solid all the way
through<00:03:15.690> epoch<00:03:16.690> definitely<00:03:17.620> worth<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.859> play

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
through epoch definitely worth a play

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.979 
through epoch definitely worth a play
this<00:03:18.220> weekend<00:03:18.639> I<00:03:18.790> would<00:03:18.940> say<00:03:19.120> just<00:03:19.359> avoid<00:03:19.959> the

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
this weekend I would say just avoid the

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.180 
this weekend I would say just avoid the
in-app<00:03:20.260> purchases

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.250
