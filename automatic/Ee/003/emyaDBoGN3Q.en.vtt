00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 in everything if we are in jeta 5 and as 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.279
 I'm seeing we're already in gta 5 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.839
 remastered the truth that is a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.340
 damn happened like I'm seeing here 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.040
 We are playing in first person with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.480
 the vehicle that is really is a bit 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.370
 complicated or without driving that is not 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.870
 so it looks a bit weird but the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.359
 true that it's pretty cool to be 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 accustomed I always speak in another way 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 to see him always a true person 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 that to notice that it is a past to me 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.080
 love this is one of the things that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.519
 we have liked along with the map and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.680
 as I'm looking down there has also 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.840
 changed and it's cool because it's not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 let's go in here let's buy what 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.350
 that would be the ax that I do not know if it 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 meet here really because it's the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.960
 first time I'm going to look for it so 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.850
 let's see where the great position with 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 this is not all things bought because 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.899
 follow up here stay because I've 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 past my character of precision after 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.590
 This xv water is very easy to pass has 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.760
 previously uploaded a video so if 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.199
 you have not seen it yet I recommend 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.199
 that you see if you want husband also 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.109
 pass our playstation character 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 3 xbox 360 to the new generation and as 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.320
 you see they have also changed what would be 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.520
 all the texture is set how it continues 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 the shotgun 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.130
 this series we are going to look for the ax that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.010
 we have it here is that more employment in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 crazy in these movie is that it seems 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.570
 it seems that the character really is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.850
 crazy let's go after this man in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620
 a whole will not give all this to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.210
 make a scary movie something the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.460
 true that dies is no longer losing the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.770
 as you are seeing but it is that it is 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.810
 one is a past to be I love me 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.640
 has loved this look how it launches 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.170
 there is also with blood is that you are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 felicÃ­simos the running you here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.729
 come on let's go let's see who is more for 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 here we look east 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.540
 we're leaving here, lady cat is here 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.800
 with the mobile leave the whatsapp 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.230
 as those who come to notice that it is super 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.810
 beast now looks like with a lot 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.790
 more real then it's like it 's like 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.440
 the character went crazy we go to 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.020
 take the car let's live from here 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.280
 because in napoli as I am seeing and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.720
 we are going to go now 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 now you also see how much speed 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.250
 we go as I am seeing and also because 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.050
 it is very cool this the truth that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.970
 it's something that they have put that I like 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.520
 very much when when I entered the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.140
 the first time you do very little of 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.940
 enter to do an hour or so and it's a 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.490
 little with the game then when you enter 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.110
 the first time and thing really this does not 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.640
 it's a generation it 's all those people 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 oil because they have changed 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.700
 a lot of things the textures is that they are 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.440
 impressive 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.820
 I liked it a lot, that's why we're going to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.490
 keep coming from the police so that 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.650
 do not catch us and as I say the truth that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.440
 I really like to leave them if you want 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.750
 you keep going higher and with gameplays 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.460
 with this character so playing in 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.410
 first person and all this and teaching 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.970
 the new souls teaching almoster and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.570
 all this that the police looked good 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.980
 they are going to kill me can you first or 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.170
 You know it's cool a lot, it's cool 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.310
 the ax thus sails in the first person 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.530
 same with the character at first 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.140
 person is a pass what would emulate 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.150
 very much is that I also put in place 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.100
 of an ax only that they also put 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.830
 imagine that they put a chainsaw 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.930
 cheese shop and through the streets of jeta 5 well 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.970
 in plan with a chainsaw and let 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.410
 It would be the most but good as I say 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.730
 guys, I hope you liked this one 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.400
 example as I'm seeing here I'm with 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.050
 my ax handing out they fixed how 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.550
 keep up with the blood this is that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.470
 given this thing when when they are 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.360
 buying the people that already 333 that 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.040
 It seems that you are doing it but not 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.360
 well guys would appreciate very much if 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.250
 you leave a piece of life I hope that you 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.960
 he liked the program his christ sales 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.960
