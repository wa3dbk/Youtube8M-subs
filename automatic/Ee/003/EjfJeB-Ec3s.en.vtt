00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.060 

for<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:24.939> first<00:00:25.210> time<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.990> PSB<00:00:26.349> have<00:00:26.800> really

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
for the first time the PSB have really

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.640 
for the first time the PSB have really
provided<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.880> mobile<00:00:28.449> platform<00:00:28.660> that<00:00:29.500> was

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
provided a mobile platform that was

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.060 
provided a mobile platform that was
capable<00:00:29.949> of<00:00:30.460> really<00:00:31.300> offering<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.930> proper<00:00:32.410> FPS

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
capable of really offering a proper FPS

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.290 
capable of really offering a proper FPS
experience<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:36.250> was<00:00:36.400> new<00:00:36.579> hardware<00:00:37.000> for<00:00:37.210> us

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
experience it was new hardware for us

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.210 
experience it was new hardware for us
and<00:00:37.570> we<00:00:37.629> thought<00:00:37.870> there's<00:00:38.470> no<00:00:38.530> way<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.949> can<00:00:39.070> get

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
and we thought there's no way we can get

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.860 
and we thought there's no way we can get
the<00:00:39.340> full<00:00:39.550> kill<00:00:39.760> zone<00:00:39.940> experience<00:00:40.420> onto<00:00:40.600> it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
the full kill zone experience onto it

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.479 
the full kill zone experience onto it
but<00:00:41.290> as<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.589> products<00:00:41.920> gone<00:00:42.040> on<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.309> realized

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
but as the products gone on we realized

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.369 
but as the products gone on we realized
hey<00:00:42.879> we<00:00:43.030> can<00:00:43.180> get<00:00:43.330> basically<00:00:43.660> everything<00:00:44.260> in

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
hey we can get basically everything in

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.710 
hey we can get basically everything in
this<00:00:44.559> getting<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.160> tech<00:00:45.370> over<00:00:45.640> making<00:00:46.449> sure

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
this getting the tech over making sure

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.290 
this getting the tech over making sure
everything<00:00:47.140> looks<00:00:47.350> amazing<00:00:47.530> runs<00:00:48.430> perfectly

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
everything looks amazing runs perfectly

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.660 
everything looks amazing runs perfectly
fortunately<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.199> b2<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.620> very<00:00:50.890> powerful<00:00:51.250> and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
fortunately the b2 is very powerful and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.729 
fortunately the b2 is very powerful and
because<00:00:52.059> we've<00:00:52.239> taken<00:00:52.809> across<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.350> kill<00:00:53.530> zone

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
because we've taken across the kill zone

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.619 
because we've taken across the kill zone
engine<00:00:54.159> we<00:00:54.610> can<00:00:54.790> actually<00:00:54.909> really<00:00:55.269> push<00:00:55.600> and

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
engine we can actually really push and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.140 
engine we can actually really push and
and<00:00:56.260> develop<00:00:56.799> the<00:00:57.309> graphics<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:57.940> get<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
and develop the graphics and get the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.079 
and develop the graphics and get the
fidelity<00:00:58.479> that<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:58.930> need<00:00:59.379> to<00:00:59.680> make<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:00.400> lived

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
fidelity that we need to make it lived

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:12.289 
fidelity that we need to make it lived
within<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.540> family<00:01:01.900> of<00:01:01.989> Killzone<00:01:02.379> games

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.569 

it's<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:13.259> surprising<00:01:13.469> how<00:01:14.039> much<00:01:14.250> detail

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
it's pretty surprising how much detail

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.849 
it's pretty surprising how much detail
you<00:01:14.789> can<00:01:15.090> make<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> screen<00:01:16.020> even<00:01:16.770> if

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
you can make out on the screen even if

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.319 
you can make out on the screen even if
you<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.670> handheld<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
you think it's just a handheld the

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.959 
you think it's just a handheld the
screens<00:01:18.689> pretty<00:01:18.990> big<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.679> really<00:01:19.890> clear<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
screens pretty big and really clear so

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.190 
screens pretty big and really clear so
when<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.210> holding<00:01:21.329> it<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.689> close<00:01:21.960> in

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
when you're holding it that close in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
when you're holding it that close in
some<00:01:22.409> ways<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:23.070> equivalent<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> sitting

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
some ways it's the equivalent to sitting

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
some ways it's the equivalent to sitting
you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.719> ten<00:01:25.110> feet<00:01:25.409> away<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.100> TV<00:01:26.610> screen

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you know ten feet away from a TV screen

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
you know ten feet away from a TV screen
you<00:01:27.119> assume<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.840> barely<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.319> out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you assume that you can barely make out

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
you assume that you can barely make out
any<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:30.060> fine<00:01:30.210> details<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
any of the little fine details but you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
any of the little fine details but you
really<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.709> still<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.729> high

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
really can it's still really a high

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
really can it's still really a high
definition<00:01:33.299> panel<00:01:33.899> there's<00:01:34.319> an<00:01:34.619> intro<00:01:35.039> to<00:01:35.069> one

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
definition panel there's an intro to one

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
definition panel there's an intro to one
of<00:01:35.459> the<00:01:35.520> missions<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.030> sees<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> dive<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.679> in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of the missions that sees you dive in in

of the missions that sees you dive in in
on<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.069> kind<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.399> wingsuit<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:42.000> pretty

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
on a kind of wingsuit it's pretty

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
on a kind of wingsuit it's pretty
impressive<00:01:42.569> but<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.469> even<00:01:43.560> more<00:01:43.709> impressive

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
impressive but it's even more impressive

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.380 
impressive but it's even more impressive
when<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> tell<00:01:44.729> people<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.239> look

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
when you tell people they can look

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.669 
when you tell people they can look
around<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> lot<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> people<00:01:46.380> didn't

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
around and a lot of people didn't

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.929 
around and a lot of people didn't
realize<00:01:46.829> they<00:01:47.099> just<00:01:47.280> sort<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.429> as<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> movie

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.580 

that<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.179> moment<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.959> could<00:01:55.170> see<00:01:55.349> people

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that was the moment you could see people

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.069 
that was the moment you could see people
right<00:01:55.920> wow<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.939> impressive<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.959> them

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
right wow this is impressive like them

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.880 
right wow this is impressive like them
have<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.439> seen<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.829> before<00:01:59.039> on<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> beta<00:01:59.640> I

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
have not seen this before on the beta I

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.380 
have not seen this before on the beta I
think<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.310> handheld<00:02:02.789> platform<00:02:03.209> really

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
think the the handheld platform really

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.389 
think the the handheld platform really
allowed<00:02:03.719> us<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.959> look<00:02:04.319> at<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.709> underlying

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
allowed us to look at the underlying

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.080 
allowed us to look at the underlying
structure<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.599> Killzone<00:02:07.200> game<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
structure of the Killzone game and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.550 
structure of the Killzone game and
reimagine<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.450> experience<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.440> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
reimagine it as experience that can be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
reimagine it as experience that can be
played<00:02:10.860> anywhere<00:02:11.370> anytime<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.569> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.319> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
played anywhere anytime and kind of in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.039 
played anywhere anytime and kind of in
any<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.829> you<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:15.209> short<00:02:15.450> bursts<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
any way you can a really short bursts of

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.990 
any way you can a really short bursts of
game<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.400> come<00:02:17.670> back<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.910> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
game and put it down and come back to it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
game and put it down and come back to it
later<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.540> take<00:02:19.290> multiplayer<00:02:19.829> on<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
later you can take multiplayer on the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.410 
later you can take multiplayer on the
move<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:21.030> Wi-Fi

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
move just over Wi-Fi

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.590 
move just over Wi-Fi
we<00:02:21.750> were<00:02:21.870> trying<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.410> offer<00:02:23.450> something<00:02:24.450> that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
we were trying so offer something that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.449 
we were trying so offer something that
people<00:02:24.840> could<00:02:25.079> just<00:02:25.290> pick<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.100> play<00:02:26.430> with

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
people could just pick up and play with

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.340 
people could just pick up and play with
that<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.239> immediacy<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.109> you<00:02:28.170> don't

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that kind of immediacy that you don't

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.210 
that kind of immediacy that you don't
always<00:02:28.500> get<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.829> home<00:02:29.160> console<00:02:29.819> game<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
always get that home console game the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500 
always get that home console game the
other<00:02:32.340> thing<00:02:32.579> that<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:32.760> was<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:33.239> interested

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
other thing that I was really interested

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.140 
other thing that I was really interested
in<00:02:33.870> maintaining<00:02:34.799> was<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.850> feel<00:02:36.120> of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
in maintaining was the the feel of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.599 
in maintaining was the the feel of
Killzone<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.260> actually<00:02:37.680> touches<00:02:37.950> through<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
Killzone it actually touches through the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.870 
Killzone it actually touches through the
the<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.470> standard<00:02:40.470> Killzone<00:02:41.099> feeling<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the kind of standard Killzone feeling of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.940 
the kind of standard Killzone feeling of
being<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.389> heavy<00:02:42.660> weighty<00:02:42.959> shooter<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.799> that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
being a heavy weighty shooter so that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.890 
being a heavy weighty shooter so that
went<00:02:44.190> through<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.609> controls<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.299> animations

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
went through the controls the animations

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.420 
went through the controls the animations
obviously<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> two<00:02:46.709> dual<00:02:47.010> analog<00:02:47.400> sticks

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
obviously the two dual analog sticks

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.580 
obviously the two dual analog sticks
made<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> big<00:02:48.150> difference<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.900> first<00:02:49.170> handheld

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
made a big difference the first handheld

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.650 
made a big difference the first handheld
with<00:02:49.980> dual<00:02:50.190> sticks<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:51.000> fact<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.329> you<00:02:51.480> can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
with dual sticks the fact that you can

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
with dual sticks the fact that you can
actually<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.109> proper<00:02:52.560> console

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
actually have a proper console

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.930 
actually have a proper console

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
you can actually get really fine aim

you can actually get really fine aim
adjustments<00:03:00.280> by<00:03:00.550> tilting<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.120> VTR<00:03:01.450> ever<00:03:01.630> so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
adjustments by tilting the VTR ever so

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.200 
adjustments by tilting the VTR ever so
slightly<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:02.500> lining<00:03:03.400> up<00:03:03.520> that<00:03:03.550> perfect

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
slightly so lining up that perfect

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.360 
slightly so lining up that perfect
headshot<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.930> you're<00:03:05.410> not<00:03:05.560> great<00:03:05.920> with<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
headshot if you're not great with the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.190 
headshot if you're not great with the
sticks<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.120> actually<00:03:07.300> use<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.900> device

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
sticks you can actually use the device

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.440 
sticks you can actually use the device
itself<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.100> get<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.760> bottom<00:03:13.270> set

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
itself just to get that the bottom set

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.510 
itself just to get that the bottom set
up<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.780> great<00:03:14.110> for<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.470> first<00:03:14.590> person<00:03:14.890> shooter

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
up is great for a first person shooter

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.070 
up is great for a first person shooter
we've<00:03:15.880> obviously<00:03:16.000> leverage<00:03:16.660> some<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
we've obviously leverage some of the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.110 
we've obviously leverage some of the
touch<00:03:17.290> elements<00:03:17.830> in<00:03:17.980> where<00:03:18.160> appropriate<00:03:18.490> we

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
touch elements in where appropriate we

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.540 
touch elements in where appropriate we
have<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.690> brutal<00:03:20.080> melee<00:03:20.410> system<00:03:20.860> now<00:03:21.040> which

have the brutal melee system now which

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.940 
have the brutal melee system now which

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
rather than just being a button press it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.620 
rather than just being a button press it
will<00:03:24.100> now<00:03:24.280> put<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.209> guy<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.360> you're

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
attacking into a synced animation and

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.270 
attacking into a synced animation and
you'll<00:03:28.510> then<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.959> window<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.950> put<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
you'll then have a window to put the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.560 
you'll then have a window to put the
gesture<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.880> on<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> touch<00:03:31.360> screen<00:03:33.570> really
