rolled<00:00:10.230> hem<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:11.059> figured<00:00:12.059> I'd<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.330> little

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559

rolled hem I figured I'd do a little
demo<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.299> somebody<00:00:15.299> taught<00:00:15.540> me<00:00:15.719> how<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.929> do

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
demo on how somebody taught me how to do

demo on how somebody taught me how to do
this<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> trick<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.350> tension<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this the trick is to have tension on the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.450 
this the trick is to have tension on the
back<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> front<00:00:21.619> what<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.100> starch

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
back and the front what you do to starch

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
back and the front what you do to starch
is<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.240> make<00:00:24.449> your<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:25.400> fold<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
is you make your first fold and you just

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.990 
is you make your first fold and you just
hold<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.550> second

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
hold it there and you make your second

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
hold it there and you make your second
fold<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.620> do<00:00:34.620> mine

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
fold so you have it you know I do mine

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.840 
fold so you have it you know I do mine
you<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.399> fairly<00:00:35.850> small<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.730> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you know fairly small and what you do is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.690 
you know fairly small and what you do is
you<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.930> right<00:00:40.079> size<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.030 

stick<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> under<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> foot<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.890> ways

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
stick it under the foot a little ways

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.180 
stick it under the foot a little ways
back<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.560> got<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.740> little<00:00:55.980> bit<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.130> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
back so you've got a little bit of the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.040 
back so you've got a little bit of the
tail<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:59.090> then<00:01:01.220> make<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.250> couple<00:01:02.490> stitches<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
tail and then make a couple stitches and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.380 
tail and then make a couple stitches and
you<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.380> back<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the beginning of here I was a little

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.070 
the beginning of here I was a little
crooked<00:01:11.120> as<00:01:12.120> a<00:01:12.180> proof<00:01:12.480> of<00:01:12.600> concept<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
crooked as a proof of concept here I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
crooked as a proof of concept here I
know<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.070> come<00:01:17.460> down<00:01:17.640> here

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
know what you do is you come down here

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.150 
know what you do is you come down here
however<00:01:18.780> far<00:01:19.020> you're<00:01:19.230> comfortable<00:01:19.710> doing<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
however far you're comfortable doing it

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.160 
however far you're comfortable doing it
and<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and you do the same thing you do at the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.330 
and you do the same thing you do at the
beginning<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.890> double<00:01:23.160> roll

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
beginning you make your double roll

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.540 
beginning you make your double roll
there<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> hold<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.280> put

there I just put a little bit of tension

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.920 
there I just put a little bit of tension
to<00:01:37.200> throw<00:01:37.620> it<00:01:37.680> flat<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.510> grab<00:01:39.750> the

and<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.830> write<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.130> them<00:02:15.650> that's<00:02:16.650> pretty<00:02:17.190> much

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and you write on them that's pretty much

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.080

all<00:02:17.489> there<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:20.819> I've<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
all there is to it so now I've got a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.800 
all there is to it so now I've got a
straight<00:02:22.940> relatively<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.270> kind<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.510> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
straight relatively it's kind of a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
straight relatively it's kind of a
little<00:02:25.050> bit<00:02:25.230> wobbly<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> panel

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
little bit wobbly but I was a panel

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.390 
little bit wobbly but I was a panel
high-tension<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> kind<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.500> see<00:02:28.739> if<00:02:29.160> you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
high-tension you can kind of see if you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.720 
high-tension you can kind of see if you
look<00:02:29.640> through<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.150> material<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> edge

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
look through the material that the edge

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
look through the material that the edge
itself<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:34.020> crooked<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.830> it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
itself is a little crooked but it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.140 
itself is a little crooked but it's
always<00:02:35.760> under<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.440> behind<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.910> so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
always under the behind the of the so

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.830 
always under the behind the of the so
line<00:02:40.190> probably<00:02:41.190> can't<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.630> see

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
line probably can't see that you can see

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.000 
line probably can't see that you can see
well<00:02:44.150> anyway<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.360> edge<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.440> material<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
well anyway the edge of the material is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.440 
well anyway the edge of the material is
always<00:02:47.510> beyond<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.340> won't<00:02:50.580> pull

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
always beyond is so and so it won't pull
