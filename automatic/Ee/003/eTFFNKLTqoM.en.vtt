 independent for you to run a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.070
 little that we are doing now and the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.580
 for you guys 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.580

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.230
 work all new compositions that 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.699
 people are thinking we are 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 recording is working we are 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.870
 finished producing some songs 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.470
 already to launch this new work in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.390
 coming months and took 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.399
 Such a rush we are working 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.520
 hard for this we had a beginning of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.550
 a little turbulent year 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 we went through some changes in the band 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.250
 the people think we were standing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.050
 but we are not one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 time but so there is a lot of news 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.060
 because of these changes 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 only that the anchor is running at all 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.220
 steam we rehearse a lot 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 working hard for soon I'll go 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 play a new thing for you 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.740
 A lot of people keep asking how 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.610
 will his absence again of the cast and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.560
 whenever he knows how to push the limits 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.330
 from our own potential to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.680
 always the same composition 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.510
 clearly I always knew 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.430
 preserve the identity of the band but 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.440
 people will explore both heavy side 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.390
 more calm staff do not know 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.310
 how is composing an album the times that it is a 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.920
 a word you can not force 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.720
 This one has to really give the maximum even 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.150
 And I even felt that it's making you 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.010
 sit and simply write any 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.780
 thing that is what we always do 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.370
 appreciated when we composed the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.350
 - It was a very good and very bad season 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.730
 sometimes because it was too much 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.290
 I would run to record a cd 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.260
 this in one way or another ended up 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.090
 summarizing in the intensity that has 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.590
 music the line in the force behind the back 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.720
 so we never never forgot how 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.900
 That's really what we like. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.900
 do 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.780
 last year was a productive year for 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.750
 The people we played in florianópolis 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.960
 curitiba são paulo - shows with bands 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.540
 very good Brazilians from the outside and also 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.940
 this year is being quite 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.860
 producing is running behind and 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.350
 Tranquility for me this year 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.510

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.770
 for us that way and is working a lot 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.270
 on top of that 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.760
 I think our effort is 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.860
 rewarded with something really cool 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.990

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.730
 have to do it right on the spot but we
