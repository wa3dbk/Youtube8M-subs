00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:09.440
I finished ironing the sleeve. Next Iron the back part.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:25.280
Would like to iron out the outer material, but if the lining was wrinkle, iron the lining ahead.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:39.980
If the center part of the lining is loose, I recommend ironing first.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:50.080
When ironing from the face side, the line may be bent if it is in a loose state.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:59.240
It is enough to lightly iron the lining.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:14.760
If it is an ironing board for home it is difficult to iron it at once, so please iron it separately about 4 times.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.020
First iron the middle part from the shoulder part.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.620
Place the patch and iron it while firmly confirming it.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.460
Iron while firmly steaming out.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:02:00.460
Iron the same way on the other side.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.760
After that a little shift, Iron the center of the back firmly.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.380
It is bad if the center part is not beautiful.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.020
The upper part is the end. Next is the bottom part.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:03:01.780
This jacket is a side vent, but in the case of the back vent it also irons in the same way.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:16.280
Adjust the hem part and side vent part, iron with the patch cloth.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.760
When ironing the vent part,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.960
do not iron in this distorted state.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.940
Iron the vent part firmly in shape.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:09.440
"Atari" of the overlapped part may be left when ironing.
&lt;"Atari" is the trace of the overlapping part of the fabric&gt;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.840
At that time, put the fabric in a state which cloth is no overlapped and iron it again.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:28.720
Iron the bottom center part of the back firmly.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.260
Ironing of the back part is completed.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:47.080
If the side part seems to be anxious, iron it in a flat state.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:05.320
"Atari" is attached to the part of the pocket, but remove at the end.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700
It is the opposite side.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.940
Make sure the fabric is flat and place the patch.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.600
Iron it while avoiding the part curved aside.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:41.600
It is hard to understand if you hide it with a patch cloth, but Iron it while checking with your finger.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.040
The left hand is important.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.920
Ironing in the back and side parts are now complete.
