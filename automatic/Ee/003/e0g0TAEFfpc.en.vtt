their first loss against Syracuse it

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.729 
their first loss against Syracuse it
seems<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.310> they<00:04:00.580> quit<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:01.750> saw<00:04:02.019> them<00:04:02.320> lose

sudden they're playing for something

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.979 
sudden they're playing for something
again<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.880> think<00:04:13.120> if<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.269> get<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> motivated

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
again and I think if we get a motivated

to find assistance so what they've done
has<00:04:28.960> been<00:04:28.990> phenomenal<00:04:29.259> but<00:04:29.889> their<00:04:30.400> offense

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
has been phenomenal but their offense

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.820 
has been phenomenal but their offense
isn't<00:04:30.970> clicking<00:04:31.120> their<00:04:31.599> 95th<00:04:32.229> and<00:04:32.470> points
