00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
all right everyone I have another

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.180 
all right everyone I have another
problem<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.480> 2000<00:00:13.410> Lincoln<00:00:13.980> Navigator

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
problem on this 2000 Lincoln Navigator

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.470 
problem on this 2000 Lincoln Navigator
and<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.660> only<00:00:15.750> current<00:00:16.170> problem<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.070> is

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
and the only current problem with it is

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
and the only current problem with it is
this<00:00:18.480> code<00:00:18.720> right<00:00:18.990> here<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.349> is<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.500> c-17<00:00:20.070> 25

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
this code right here which is a c-17 25

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.359 
this code right here which is a c-17 25
and<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.989> to<00:00:22.169> at<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.380> front<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> general

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and as to at the front it's a general

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.940 
and as to at the front it's a general
pneumatic<00:00:23.910> fault<00:00:24.300> basically<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.529> module

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
pneumatic fault basically the module

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.159 
pneumatic fault basically the module
knows<00:00:26.219> the<00:00:26.790> front<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.270> not<00:00:27.480> raising<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
knows the front is not raising and

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.769 
knows the front is not raising and
lowering<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.649> commanded<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:30.119> does<00:00:30.270> not<00:00:30.480> know

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
lowering as commanded but does not know

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.380 
lowering as commanded but does not know
why<00:00:31.020> I'm<00:00:31.469> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.680> show<00:00:31.770> you<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> quick<00:00:32.099> trick

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
why I'm going to show you a quick trick

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
why I'm going to show you a quick trick
and<00:00:33.390> what<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.629> can<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> test<00:00:34.340> alright<00:00:35.340> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and what you can do to test alright so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.889 
and what you can do to test alright so
if<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.640> compressors<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.239> coming<00:00:36.539> on<00:00:36.660> it's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
if your compressors not coming on it's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.920 
if your compressors not coming on it's
not<00:00:37.020> responding<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.789> what<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
not responding at all what you can do is

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
not responding at all what you can do is
come<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.079> front<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> there's<00:00:41.609> a<00:00:41.699> sensor

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
come up front here and there's a sensor

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.369 
come up front here and there's a sensor
you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.269> see<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.659> right<00:00:42.899> here

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you can see it right here

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
you can see it right here
and<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.159> old-style<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> older

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and these are old-style in the older

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
and these are old-style in the older
navigators<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.659> expeditions<00:00:46.499> and<00:00:46.710> they're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
navigators and expeditions and they're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
navigators and expeditions and they're
pretty<00:00:47.100> reliable<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.789> far<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.089> sensor

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pretty reliable as far as the sensor

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.599 
pretty reliable as far as the sensor
itself<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.679> their<00:00:49.829> mountings<00:00:50.249> on<00:00:50.429> them

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
itself but their mountings on them

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.029 
itself but their mountings on them
aren't<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.659> this<00:00:51.780> may<00:00:51.929> fail<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.319> fall<00:00:52.800> off

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
aren't so this may fail it fall off

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
aren't so this may fail it fall off
every<00:00:53.370> once<00:00:53.609> in<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.760> while<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> caused

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
every once in a while and caused

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.619 
every once in a while and caused
problems<00:00:55.649> front<00:00:56.069> or<00:00:56.219> rear<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.329> easy

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
problems front or rear but this easy

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.809 
problems front or rear but this easy
thing<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.929> do<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> make<00:00:59.100> sure<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.699> of

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
thing you do to make sure it's kind of

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.639 
thing you do to make sure it's kind of
sensor<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> mounting<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> course<00:01:01.499> you're

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
sensor the mounting now of course you're

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
sensor the mounting now of course you're
going<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> falling<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.120> that's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
going to see it falling off and that's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
going to see it falling off and that's
obviously<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> problem<00:01:04.580> but<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> may<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
obviously a problem but it may be one of

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
obviously a problem but it may be one of
the<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.440> your<00:01:07.590> particular

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the two or three on your particular

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
the two or three on your particular
vehicle<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.360> make<00:01:09.990> sure<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
vehicle so what you can do make sure the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
vehicle so what you can do make sure the
compressor<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.130> modules<00:01:11.610> seeing

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
compressor and the modules seeing

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
compressor and the modules seeing
everything<00:01:12.150> correctly<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> compressor

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
everything correctly and compressor

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.290 
everything correctly and compressor
actually<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:13.950> raise<00:01:14.160> and<00:01:14.400> lower<00:01:14.430> vent

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
actually can raise and lower vent

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.090 
actually can raise and lower vent
solenoids<00:01:15.810> gate<00:01:16.140> valves<00:01:16.620> everything<00:01:17.010> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
solenoids gate valves everything is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.430 
solenoids gate valves everything is
being<00:01:17.280> checked<00:01:17.550> by<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.840> test<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
being checked by this one little test I

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.560 
being checked by this one little test I
like<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.010> just<00:01:20.160> reach<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.550> here<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:23.450> take<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
like I just reach in here and take it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.760 
like I just reach in here and take it
off<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.580> right<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:27.090> thinks<00:01:27.770> suspensions

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
off and right now it thinks suspensions

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
off and right now it thinks suspensions
way<00:01:29.040> down<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:30.210> means<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.660> suspension<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
way down which means the suspension is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
way down which means the suspension is
actually<00:01:31.710> jet<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:32.160> up<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> body<00:01:32.580> of<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.940> is<00:01:33.140> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
actually jet way up the body of it is so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
actually jet way up the body of it is so
as<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:35.040> heard<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.970> turns<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
as you heard right there it turns on the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.470 
as you heard right there it turns on the
vent<00:01:37.050> here<00:01:37.680> air<00:01:38.040> venting<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.730> then<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> course

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
vent here air venting and then of course

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.580 
vent here air venting and then of course
you'll<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> body<00:01:40.020> start<00:01:40.320> coming<00:01:40.530> down

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you'll see the body start coming down

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.000 
you'll see the body start coming down
close<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.190> wheel<00:01:41.310> wells<00:01:41.580> here<00:01:41.880> same<00:01:42.720> thing

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
close to the wheel wells here same thing

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.490 
close to the wheel wells here same thing
you<00:01:44.010> were<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.960> push<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you were like this push it up see that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.020 
you were like this push it up see that
and<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.850> compressor<00:01:48.390> should<00:01:49.200> come<00:01:49.380> on

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
and the compressor should come on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.480 
and the compressor should come on
telling<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.440> that<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.560> compressor<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.010> fine

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
telling you that the compressor is fine

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.180 
telling you that the compressor is fine
here<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:55.240> let's<00:01:55.450> come<00:01:55.600> on<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.010> gate

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
here so let's come on all the gate

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.830 
here so let's come on all the gate
valves

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.399 

and<00:02:00.229> that<00:02:00.439> course<00:02:00.710> will<00:02:00.829> see<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.070> body<00:02:01.280> raise

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the compressor and that course turn to

that's<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:32.609> going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:32.969> it's<00:02:33.180> going

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that's what it's going to do it's going

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.220 
that's what it's going to do it's going
to<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:34.230> see<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:35.040> change<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.549> voltage<00:02:35.700> from<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
to not see a change in voltage from this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.209 
to not see a change in voltage from this
let's<00:02:37.230> turn<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.439> compressor<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.920> turn<00:02:38.129> the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
let's turn the compressor on turn the

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.429 
let's turn the compressor on turn the
compressor<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.700> well<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:40.079> sets<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
compressor on well that just sets a

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.899 
compressor on well that just sets a
general<00:02:40.799> pneumatic<00:02:41.250> fault<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:41.670> there's<00:02:41.819> an

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
general pneumatic fault think there's an

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:42.709 
general pneumatic fault think there's an
air<00:02:42.030> leak<00:02:42.239> somewhere

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
air leak somewhere

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.899 
air leak somewhere
it<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:43.439> can't<00:02:43.680> pump<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.189> or<00:02:44.430> vent<00:02:44.670> out

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
it just can't pump it up or vent out

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.520 
it just can't pump it up or vent out
it's<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.109> general<00:02:46.950> fault<00:02:47.790> code<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's kind of a general fault code so you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.319 
it's kind of a general fault code so you
need<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> start<00:02:49.919> checking<00:02:50.280> items<00:02:50.669> like<00:02:51.030> this

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
need to start checking items like this

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.899 
need to start checking items like this
or<00:02:51.659> airline<00:02:52.109> leaks<00:02:52.379> or<00:02:53.129> what's<00:02:53.340> common<00:02:53.819> on

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
or airline leaks or what's common on

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.490 
or airline leaks or what's common on
these<00:02:54.030> also<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.780> air<00:02:54.900> shocks<00:02:55.230> themselves

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
these also is the air shocks themselves

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.800 
these also is the air shocks themselves
down<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.069> here<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.639> know<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.329> pretty<00:02:57.419> dark<00:02:57.689> in

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
down in here I know it's pretty dark in

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.849 
down in here I know it's pretty dark in
here<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:59.400> turn<00:02:59.849> down<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:00.650> there<00:03:01.650> goes

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
here but it's turn down here there goes

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.199 
here but it's turn down here there goes
there<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.370> go

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
there we go

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.089 
there we go
the<00:03:03.510> air<00:03:03.629> shocks<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.439> what<00:03:04.709> happens<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the air shocks in here what happens a

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.319 
the air shocks in here what happens a
lot<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.280> these<00:03:05.519> they'll<00:03:05.879> get<00:03:05.969> to<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> certain

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
lot of these they'll get to a certain

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.720 
lot of these they'll get to a certain
height<00:03:06.680> right<00:03:07.680> height<00:03:07.859> right<00:03:07.889> maybe<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.549> little

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
height right height right maybe a little

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.399 
height right height right maybe a little
higher<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.329> down<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.629> road<00:03:09.719> bumps<00:03:10.169> and

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
higher to go on down the road bumps and

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.740 
higher to go on down the road bumps and
the<00:03:11.219> air<00:03:11.540> seals<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.230> shock<00:03:13.500> down<00:03:13.739> there

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the air seals on the shock down there

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
the air seals on the shock down there
they'll<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.810> torn<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.739> as<00:03:16.859> certain<00:03:17.190> height

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
they'll be torn so as certain height

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.599 
they'll be torn so as certain height
it'll<00:03:18.090> lose<00:03:18.329> air<00:03:18.629> also<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:19.949> this<00:03:20.370> thing

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
it'll lose air also and then this thing

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.039 
it'll lose air also and then this thing
is<00:03:20.639> constantly<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.359> on<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.930> is

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
is constantly going on this is

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.599 
is constantly going on this is
connectivity<00:03:22.409> is<00:03:22.590> fine<00:03:22.769> right<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
connectivity is fine right but the

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.490 
connectivity is fine right but the
compressor<00:03:24.150> will<00:03:24.540> notice<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.169> dropping

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
compressor will notice it's dropping

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.860 
compressor will notice it's dropping
once<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:25.979> get<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.159> that<00:03:26.250> point<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:27.150> it's

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
once you get to that point and it's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.300 
once you get to that point and it's
constantly<00:03:28.349> come<00:03:28.439> on<00:03:28.590> constantly<00:03:29.010> coming<00:03:29.189> on

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
constantly come on constantly coming on

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.599 
constantly come on constantly coming on
correcting<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.470> that's<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.769> pretty<00:03:32.340> common

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
correcting and that's a pretty common

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.089 
correcting and that's a pretty common
for<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.909> air<00:03:33.030> shocks<00:03:33.359> on<00:03:33.569> these<00:03:33.889> so<00:03:34.889> there's<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
for the air shocks on these so there's a

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.559 
for the air shocks on these so there's a
few<00:03:35.220> turbine<00:03:35.459> things<00:03:35.729> usually<00:03:35.939> two<00:03:36.150> air<00:03:36.329> leak

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
few turbine things usually two air leak

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.599 
few turbine things usually two air leak
or<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> sensor<00:03:37.680> fault<00:03:37.919> like<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.250> which<00:03:38.430> just

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
or a sensor fault like this which just

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.390 
or a sensor fault like this which just
cannot<00:03:39.169> when<00:03:40.169> it's<00:03:40.260> commanded<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.280> is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
cannot when it's commanded it just is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.879 
cannot when it's commanded it just is
not<00:03:41.579> moving<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.239> it'll<00:03:43.109> set<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.439> fault<00:03:43.709> and

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
not moving and it'll set that fault and

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.729 
not moving and it'll set that fault and
disable<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.939> compressor<00:03:45.449> also<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.530> why

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
disable the compressor also that's why

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.499 
disable the compressor also that's why
you<00:03:46.799> may<00:03:47.009> notice<00:03:47.370> everything<00:03:47.939> gets<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.359> gets

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
you may notice everything gets to gets

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.679 
you may notice everything gets to gets
landed<00:03:48.959> around<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.409> front<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.919> rear<00:03:50.689> so

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
landed around the front and rear so

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.969 
landed around the front and rear so
we're<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.989> put<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.169> back<00:03:52.319> up<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:52.650> here

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
we're going to put this back up on here

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.039 
we're going to put this back up on here
this<00:03:53.159> one<00:03:53.370> fell<00:03:53.609> off<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.720> can<00:03:54.870> see<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
this one fell off you can see the

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.469 
this one fell off you can see the
mounting<00:03:55.319> on<00:03:55.439> it<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.009> just<00:03:56.250> fine<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.970> metal

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
mounting on it it's just fine the metal

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.659 
mounting on it it's just fine the metal
tab<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.900> here<00:03:58.079> just<00:03:58.259> isn't<00:03:58.500> strong<00:03:58.739> enough<00:03:58.769> but

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
tab on here just isn't strong enough but

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.039 
tab on here just isn't strong enough but
you<00:03:59.759> can<00:03:59.939> do<00:04:00.180> because<00:04:00.389> these<00:04:00.599> sensors<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:00.959> I

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
you can do because these sensors like I

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.240 
you can do because these sensors like I
said<00:04:01.199> are<00:04:01.290> pretty<00:04:01.500> reliable<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.979> the<00:04:02.040> older

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
said are pretty reliable in the older

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.780 
said are pretty reliable in the older
ones<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:03.599> pop<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.109> back<00:04:04.139> on<00:04:04.379> okay<00:04:05.220> pop<00:04:05.549> down

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
ones is pop it back on okay pop down

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.479 
ones is pop it back on okay pop down
ones<00:04:06.000> right<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:06.389> right<00:04:06.689> height<00:04:07.259> and<00:04:07.500> then<00:04:08.250> just

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
ones right up right height and then just

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.770 
ones right up right height and then just
sit<00:04:08.639> tight<00:04:08.669> around<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.299> here<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.449> couple<00:04:09.509> times

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
sit tight around in here a couple times

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.110 
sit tight around in here a couple times
so<00:04:10.169> it<00:04:10.229> doesn't<00:04:10.470> pop<00:04:10.560> off<00:04:10.829> again<00:04:11.099> on<00:04:11.159> there<00:04:11.370> you

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
so it doesn't pop off again on there you

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.140 
so it doesn't pop off again on there you
can<00:04:12.239> see<00:04:12.389> now<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:12.689> correcting<00:04:13.079> once<00:04:13.229> again

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 

just<00:04:18.630> open<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.900> gate<00:04:19.109> valve<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.769> both<00:04:19.919> sides

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
just open the gate valve and both sides

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.010 
just open the gate valve and both sides
are<00:04:20.340> pumping<00:04:20.790> now

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.500 

you<00:04:23.380> see

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.640 

and<00:04:30.510> once<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.840> gets<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.110> right<00:04:31.440> height

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and once it gets to that right height

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.380 
and once it gets to that right height
listen<00:04:32.040> again<00:04:32.250> after<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:32.880> venting<00:04:33.270> like

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
listen again after that venting like

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.230 
listen again after that venting like
that<00:04:33.630> for<00:04:34.590> additional<00:04:35.160> air<00:04:35.310> leaks<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:36.030> should

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
that for additional air leaks it should

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.230 
that for additional air leaks it should
hold<00:04:36.420> at<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.020> point<00:04:37.880> alright<00:04:38.880> so<00:04:39.030> I'll<00:04:39.090> show

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
hold at this point alright so I'll show

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.180 
hold at this point alright so I'll show
you<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.630> scan<00:04:40.080> tool<00:04:40.380> what<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.650> looks<00:04:40.920> like

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
you on the scan tool what it looks like

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.340 
you on the scan tool what it looks like
you<00:04:41.400> see<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.700> front<00:04:41.970> fill<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.390> on<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:43.140> gate

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
you see the front fill is on the gate

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.380 
you see the front fill is on the gate
valves<00:04:43.830> on<00:04:43.980> now<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.550> need<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.790> turn<00:04:44.910> turn<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
valves on now we need to turn turn the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.600 
valves on now we need to turn turn the
compressor<00:04:45.630> on<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.380> then<00:04:46.950> we'll<00:04:47.100> watch<00:04:47.250> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
compressor on and then we'll watch the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.720 
compressor on and then we'll watch the
height<00:04:48.330> sensor<00:04:48.810> voltage<00:04:49.110> change<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.640> that's

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
height sensor voltage change and that's

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.160 
height sensor voltage change and that's
what<00:04:50.880> it's<00:04:51.060> looking<00:04:51.270> for<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.840> once<00:04:52.020> it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
what it's looking for and once it

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.450 
what it's looking for and once it
doesn't<00:04:52.410> find<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.160> notice<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
doesn't find that and notice the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.940 
doesn't find that and notice the
compressors<00:04:53.820> coming<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.150> there's<00:04:54.390> no<00:04:54.480> fault

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
compressors coming on there's no fault

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.120 
compressors coming on there's no fault
over<00:04:55.950> here<00:04:56.510> it'll<00:04:57.510> it'll<00:04:57.870> throw<00:04:58.080> that<00:04:58.320> general

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
over here it'll it'll throw that general

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.790 
over here it'll it'll throw that general
pneumatic<00:04:59.580> fault<00:04:59.820> and<00:04:59.940> disable<00:05:00.390> system<00:05:00.800> to

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.890 
only lies in the front half of the
vehicle<00:06:05.580> so<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.210> first<00:06:06.449> thing<00:06:06.629> you<00:06:06.689> want<00:06:06.840> to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
vehicle so the first thing you want to

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.390 
vehicle so the first thing you want to
do<00:06:07.050> is<00:06:07.169> inspect<00:06:07.529> the<00:06:07.740> airline's<00:06:08.159> themselves

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
do is inspect the airline's themselves

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.670 
do is inspect the airline's themselves
make<00:06:09.000> sure<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.240> felt<00:06:09.330> damage<00:06:09.779> to<00:06:09.930> them<00:06:10.080> Nick's

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
make sure it felt damage to them Nick's

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.730 
make sure it felt damage to them Nick's
cuts<00:06:11.840> disconnection<00:06:12.840> stuff<00:06:13.229> like<00:06:13.469> that

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
cuts disconnection stuff like that

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.649 
cuts disconnection stuff like that
especially<00:06:14.039> around<00:06:14.879> the<00:06:14.939> curve<00:06:15.180> they<00:06:15.419> like<00:06:15.539> to

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
especially around the curve they like to

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.869 
especially around the curve they like to
get<00:06:15.779> brittle<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:16.349> crack<00:06:16.949> on<00:06:17.129> the<00:06:17.219> curves<00:06:17.550> and

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
get brittle and crack on the curves and

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.089 
get brittle and crack on the curves and
the<00:06:18.419> air<00:06:18.539> lines<00:06:18.750> go<00:06:18.990> from<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.379> right<00:06:19.800> front

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
the air lines go from the right front

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.159 
the air lines go from the right front
wheel<00:06:20.159> well<00:06:20.520> area<00:06:20.699> the<00:06:21.180> air<00:06:21.419> compressor<00:06:21.960> over

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
wheel well area the air compressor over

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.110 
wheel well area the air compressor over
to<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.919> gate<00:06:23.189> valve<00:06:23.490> on<00:06:23.759> the<00:06:23.849> front

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
to the gate valve on the front

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.179 
to the gate valve on the front
crossmember<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:25.110> then<00:06:25.439> from<00:06:25.620> there<00:06:25.830> on<00:06:25.860> out

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
crossmember and then from there on out

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.040 
crossmember and then from there on out
it<00:06:26.219> branches<00:06:26.729> out<00:06:26.849> to<00:06:27.029> each<00:06:27.180> air<00:06:27.449> shock<00:06:27.779> on

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
it branches out to each air shock on

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.980 
it branches out to each air shock on
there<00:06:28.699> now<00:06:29.699> if<00:06:29.759> the<00:06:29.939> airlines<00:06:30.360> check<00:06:30.659> out<00:06:30.810> okay

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
there now if the airlines check out okay

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.719 
there now if the airlines check out okay
the<00:06:31.469> next<00:06:31.650> thing<00:06:31.710> you<00:06:31.860> want<00:06:31.979> to<00:06:32.039> do<00:06:32.189> is<00:06:32.310> inspect

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
the next thing you want to do is inspect

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.670 
the next thing you want to do is inspect
the<00:06:33.060> air<00:06:33.240> shocks<00:06:33.539> themselves<00:06:33.810> for<00:06:34.349> leakage

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
the air shocks themselves for leakage

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.589 
the air shocks themselves for leakage
and<00:06:34.889> the<00:06:35.279> way<00:06:35.400> you<00:06:35.460> do<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:35.939> is<00:06:36.150> you<00:06:36.360> get<00:06:36.509> out

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
and the way you do that is you get out

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.200 
and the way you do that is you get out
of<00:06:36.659> the<00:06:36.779> vehicle<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.590> lock<00:06:37.979> it<00:06:38.250> therefore<00:06:38.759> it

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
of the vehicle you lock it therefore it

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.909 
of the vehicle you lock it therefore it
goes<00:06:39.360> into<00:06:39.599> the<00:06:39.779> kneel<00:06:40.020> position<00:06:40.650> like<00:06:40.770> it's

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
goes into the kneel position like it's

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.010 
goes into the kneel position like it's
supposed<00:06:41.219> to<00:06:41.400> for<00:06:41.789> easy<00:06:41.940> entry<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.419> exit<00:06:42.839> and

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
supposed to for easy entry and exit and

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.529 
supposed to for easy entry and exit and
then<00:06:43.800> you<00:06:44.039> get<00:06:44.190> back<00:06:44.400> in<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:44.699> vehicle<00:06:44.849> start

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
then you get back in the vehicle start

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.719 
then you get back in the vehicle start
it<00:06:45.659> up<00:06:45.779> it'll<00:06:46.169> automatically<00:06:46.919> go<00:06:47.099> back<00:06:47.310> up<00:06:47.520> to

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
it up it'll automatically go back up to

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.059 
it up it'll automatically go back up to
ride<00:06:48.000> height<00:06:48.270> while<00:06:48.810> someone<00:06:49.229> else<00:06:49.440> is<00:06:49.860> down

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:50.069 
ride height while someone else is down

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.129 
ride height while someone else is down
below<00:06:50.279> listening<00:06:50.849> to<00:06:50.940> each<00:06:51.089> front<00:06:51.539> air<00:06:51.810> shock

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
below listening to each front air shock

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.430 
below listening to each front air shock
for<00:06:52.740> leakage<00:06:53.159> on<00:06:53.339> there<00:06:53.610> it's<00:06:54.569> common<00:06:55.080> once<00:06:55.289> it

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
for leakage on there it's common once it

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.290 
for leakage on there it's common once it
gets<00:06:55.620> that<00:06:55.860> ride<00:06:56.159> height<00:06:56.400> or<00:06:56.550> just<00:06:56.789> above<00:06:57.120> it

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
gets that ride height or just above it

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.930 
gets that ride height or just above it
that<00:06:57.810> shock<00:06:58.319> shaft<00:06:58.680> down<00:06:58.889> there<00:06:59.159> is<00:06:59.250> worn<00:06:59.610> and

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
that shock shaft down there is worn and

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.269 
that shock shaft down there is worn and
it<00:07:00.389> just<00:07:00.569> blows<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:01.169> air<00:07:01.319> out<00:07:01.589> on<00:07:01.800> there<00:07:02.009> so

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
it just blows the air out on there so

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.459 
it just blows the air out on there so
that<00:07:02.849> it<00:07:03.150> will<00:07:03.210> get<00:07:03.389> to<00:07:03.509> that<00:07:03.539> point<00:07:03.659> pump<00:07:04.229> up

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:04.469 
that it will get to that point pump up

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.790 
that it will get to that point pump up
and<00:07:05.300> then<00:07:06.300> the<00:07:06.419> compressor<00:07:06.870> will<00:07:07.259> notice<00:07:07.620> that

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
and then the compressor will notice that

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.589 
and then the compressor will notice that
it<00:07:08.009> will<00:07:08.099> pump<00:07:08.339> it<00:07:08.460> back<00:07:08.490> up<00:07:08.819> again<00:07:08.939> but<00:07:09.539> only

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
it will pump it back up again but only

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.779 
it will pump it back up again but only
after<00:07:09.990> a<00:07:10.020> few<00:07:10.110> times<00:07:10.560> they'll<00:07:10.919> just<00:07:10.949> time<00:07:11.460> out

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
after a few times they'll just time out

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:13.579 
after a few times they'll just time out
and<00:07:12.210> I'll<00:07:12.629> throw<00:07:12.810> its<00:07:12.990> hands<00:07:13.199> up<00:07:13.349> in<00:07:13.469> the<00:07:13.500> air

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:13.589 
and I'll throw its hands up in the air

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.579 
and I'll throw its hands up in the air
and<00:07:13.860> set<00:07:14.069> that<00:07:14.189> seat<00:07:14.490> 1725<00:07:15.419> code<00:07:15.750> because<00:07:16.439> it

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:16.589 
and set that seat 1725 code because it

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:18.350 
and set that seat 1725 code because it
cannot<00:07:16.889> keep<00:07:17.310> the<00:07:17.520> right<00:07:17.759> height<00:07:18.000> of<00:07:18.210> the

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
cannot keep the right height of the

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.329 
cannot keep the right height of the
vehicle<00:07:18.810> and<00:07:18.870> matter<00:07:19.050> what<00:07:19.139> it<00:07:19.379> does<00:07:19.589> and<00:07:19.949> the

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:20.339 
vehicle and matter what it does and the

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.529 
vehicle and matter what it does and the
last<00:07:20.580> thing<00:07:20.759> you<00:07:20.819> want<00:07:21.000> to<00:07:21.029> check<00:07:21.210> is<00:07:21.419> the

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
last thing you want to check is the

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.119 
last thing you want to check is the
height<00:07:21.689> sensor<00:07:22.139> itself<00:07:22.469> make<00:07:22.830> sure<00:07:22.979> it's

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:23.129 
height sensor itself make sure it's

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:25.369 
height sensor itself make sure it's
actually<00:07:23.339> connected<00:07:24.060> to<00:07:24.240> the<00:07:24.509> ball<00:07:24.870> stud<00:07:25.199> on

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:25.379 
actually connected to the ball stud on

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.649 
actually connected to the ball stud on
there<00:07:25.620> like<00:07:26.129> I<00:07:26.189> said<00:07:26.430> they<00:07:26.610> that<00:07:26.909> spring<00:07:27.330> steal

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:27.659 
there like I said they that spring steal

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:30.290 
there like I said they that spring steal
it<00:07:27.930> loses<00:07:28.349> tension<00:07:29.189> over<00:07:29.400> time<00:07:29.610> or<00:07:29.939> the<00:07:30.120> ball

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
it loses tension over time or the ball

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.089 
it loses tension over time or the ball
stud<00:07:30.599> wears<00:07:30.870> away<00:07:31.169> from<00:07:31.409> rust<00:07:31.620> and<00:07:31.830> corrosion

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
stud wears away from rust and corrosion

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.040 
stud wears away from rust and corrosion
over<00:07:32.279> the<00:07:32.460> years<00:07:32.669> and<00:07:32.879> it<00:07:33.330> just<00:07:33.360> cannot<00:07:33.839> hold

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
over the years and it just cannot hold

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.329 
over the years and it just cannot hold
on<00:07:34.229> no<00:07:34.409> more<00:07:34.529> you<00:07:34.680> go<00:07:34.800> over<00:07:34.949> some<00:07:35.159> rough

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:35.339 
on no more you go over some rough

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:37.129 
on no more you go over some rough
terrain<00:07:35.550> it<00:07:35.879> pops<00:07:36.180> right<00:07:36.330> off<00:07:36.539> of<00:07:36.689> there<00:07:36.990> and

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 
terrain it pops right off of there and

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.769 
terrain it pops right off of there and
that<00:07:37.500> was<00:07:37.620> the<00:07:37.740> case<00:07:37.919> with<00:07:38.159> this<00:07:38.310> one<00:07:38.610> so<00:07:39.479> again

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:39.779 
that was the case with this one so again

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:42.330 
that was the case with this one so again
these<00:07:39.960> air<00:07:40.199> suspensions<00:07:40.860> they<00:07:41.219> seem<00:07:41.580> probably

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:42.340 
these air suspensions they seem probably

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.150 
these air suspensions they seem probably
Kanan<00:07:42.699> but<00:07:43.570> you<00:07:43.750> have<00:07:43.990> to<00:07:44.199> look<00:07:44.380> at<00:07:44.530> the<00:07:44.620> basics

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
Kanan but you have to look at the basics

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.000 
Kanan but you have to look at the basics
first<00:07:45.400> a<00:07:45.669> lot<00:07:45.850> of<00:07:46.000> times<00:07:46.270> it's<00:07:46.750> the<00:07:47.139> basics<00:07:47.830> on

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
first a lot of times it's the basics on

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.670 
first a lot of times it's the basics on
these<00:07:48.220> and<00:07:48.690> you<00:07:49.690> know<00:07:49.720> half<00:07:50.050> the<00:07:50.230> time<00:07:50.260> I<00:07:50.440> guess

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 
these and you know half the time I guess

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.710 
these and you know half the time I guess
you<00:07:50.800> could<00:07:50.889> say<00:07:51.100> it's<00:07:51.850> the<00:07:51.970> air<00:07:52.180> shock<00:07:52.479> that's

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 
you could say it's the air shock that's

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.890 
you could say it's the air shock that's
blowing<00:07:53.440> out<00:07:53.560> and<00:07:53.710> just<00:07:53.860> worn<00:07:54.100> out<00:07:54.280> from<00:07:54.520> time

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 
blowing out and just worn out from time

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.050 
blowing out and just worn out from time
so<00:07:55.900> do<00:07:56.290> a<00:07:56.320> thorough<00:07:56.710> visual<00:07:57.040> inspection<00:07:57.850> and

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.060 
so do a thorough visual inspection and

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.960 
so do a thorough visual inspection and
you'll<00:07:58.479> avoid<00:07:58.900> unnecessary<00:07:59.860> repairs<00:08:00.070> like<00:08:00.850> I

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970 
you'll avoid unnecessary repairs like I

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.750 
you'll avoid unnecessary repairs like I
did<00:08:01.180> on<00:08:01.210> this<00:08:01.510> vehicle
