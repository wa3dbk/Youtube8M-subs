00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
story it stayed where it was meant to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
juhi and it didn't go anywhere so I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400 
juhi and it didn't go anywhere so I
would<00:02:35.910> definitely<00:02:36.420> recommend<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:37.050> set<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
would definitely recommend to set it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.310 
would definitely recommend to set it
with<00:02:37.440> some<00:02:37.590> form<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.220> powder<00:02:38.780> otherwise<00:02:39.780> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
with some form of powder otherwise it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.130 
with some form of powder otherwise it
can<00:02:40.920> become<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.430> little<00:02:41.700> too<00:02:42.120> glowy<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.900> dewy

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
can become a little too glowy and dewy

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.060 
can become a little too glowy and dewy
and<00:02:43.770> shiny<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:46.140> normal<00:02:46.770> or

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
combination oily skin I would definitely

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.700 
combination oily skin I would definitely
recommend<00:02:51.300> trying<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:51.990> before<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.470> buy

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
recommend trying it out before you buy

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.370 
recommend trying it out before you buy
the<00:02:52.770> full<00:02:53.100> size<00:02:53.210> because<00:02:54.210> having<00:02:54.420> dry<00:02:54.870> skin

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
the full size because having dry skin

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.940 
the full size because having dry skin
myself<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.310> still<00:02:56.880> managed<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.330> get<00:02:57.570> oily<00:02:58.410> so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
myself it still managed to get oily so

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.430 
myself it still managed to get oily so
definitely<00:02:59.460> do<00:02:59.580> try<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.300> definitely<00:03:00.750> set

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
definitely do try it and definitely set

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800 
definitely do try it and definitely set
it<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:01.740> some<00:03:01.980> form<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> powder<00:03:02.810> now

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
it with some form of the powder now

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
it with some form of the powder now
would<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.020> recommend<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.710> products<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.340> still

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
would I recommend the products I still

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.520 
would I recommend the products I still
probably<00:03:05.910> would<00:03:06.360> recommend<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.990> product<00:03:07.290> it

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
probably would recommend the product it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800 
probably would recommend the product it
was<00:03:07.740> quite<00:03:08.100> pleasant<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.550> use<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.510> don't

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
coverage it can replace a tinted

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
coverage it can replace a tinted
moisturizer<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.760> it's<00:03:14.880> not<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.300> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
moisturizer but it's not going to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.960

slightly even coverage and SPF which is
a<00:03:29.040> plus<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:30.030> still<00:03:30.510> will<00:03:30.960> recommend<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.620> but

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
a plus I still will recommend it but
