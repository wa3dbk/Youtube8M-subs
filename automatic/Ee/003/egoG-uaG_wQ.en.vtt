 [Music] 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.930
 I will always love you a story of Hans 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.930
 wilhelm 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.100
 this is the story of the end the best 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.820
 little dog of the world 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.600
 the end I grew up together but she 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.510
 it grew much quicker than me 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.400
 I liked to rest my head on his 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.960
 hot skin 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.960
 we dreamed together 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.770
 my brother and my sister also wanted 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.190
 a lot to them 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 but the end was my dog 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.650
 [Music] 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 every day the physio we played together 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.809
 the film loved to chase 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.860
 squirrels and dig among the flowers of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.860
 my mother's garden 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.560
 Sometimes he would make some mischief and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.980
 then my parents got mad or the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.480
 he scolded but they still loved her 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.770
 only that they had never told him 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.770
 they thought the end already knew 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.940
 the years passed very quickly 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.270
 I was growing towards the top and 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.860
 the end grew towards the wide towards 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.540
 width 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 the more years he had the more sleep 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.720
 I did not want to go for a walk like before 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.800
 I was worried about that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.150
 We take the vet to the fi 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.220
 there was nothing he could do 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.730
 [Music] 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.720
 the end is getting old said the 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.750
 vet 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 [Music] 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.880
 at the end it was increasingly difficult for him to climb 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.100
 the stairs 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.730
 but I had to sleep in my room 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.810
 I put a very soft cushion so that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.810
 I was more comfortable 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.580
 [Music] 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.660
 every night when we went to bed I told him 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.440
 I will always love you 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.810
 I know that the film understood 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 one morning I woke up and saw that the end 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.250
 he had died during the night 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.890
 do not 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.010
 [Music] 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:01.460
 we all buried to the end and prayed 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.040
 and we embrace to console ourselves 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.430
 my brother and my sister wanted a lot 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.760
 he but he had never been told 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 I was also very sad but I 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.790
 He consoled to know that every night he had 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.100
 said I will always love you 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.730
 Y 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.450
 a neighbor of mine offered me a puppy 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.659
 I know it would not have mattered to the end 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.989
 but I said no I did was 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:38.860
 giving her the bed at the end made her more 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.860
 miss me 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.340
 two 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.730
 someday I will have another dog or a cat or 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:55.870
 a goldfish whatever each 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.870
 I'll tell you, I'll always love you 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:04.020
