00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.319

 when they said that the village is near me 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:04:00.970

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.880

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.120

 lukas so unsafe it's a bubble and where 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.960
 generally hungry for purgatory is not 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.200
 it seems so I think you're in some kind 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.200
 the room 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:15.649
 tear as maxi here got on how much I 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.529
 Mycroft know the dimensions of the blocks it 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:20.769
 cubic meter that is boy just 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:24.789

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:35.149

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:55.899
 schoolchildren's islands trembling and your grass without 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:55.899
 to screws in general from here politics vector 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.249
 you decided to barricade them 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:06.159
 carpets given that the doors 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.159
 open in the room but for good luck 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.400
 now when it's all over the question 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.160
 viewers and what is the meaning of the video 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.340
 for what purpose it was filmed TV series 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.980
 called village fire series fire i 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.560
 I saw the village, too, well for a demonstration 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.740
 all this took minutes and a half why 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.990
 they shot 3 times more and these 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:01.310
 three minutes were superfluous 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.560
 meaningless why all filmed 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.540
 series I put 2 out of 10 only for shaders 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.240
