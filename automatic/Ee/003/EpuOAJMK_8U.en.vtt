lameness as a deficit in their gait but
it<00:00:21.700> could<00:00:21.880> be<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.090> result<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.689> any<00:00:22.930> number<00:00:23.770> of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
system can cause lameness so so it

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.920 
system can cause lameness so so it
definitely<00:00:36.370> is<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> broad<00:00:36.700> term<00:00:36.910> probably<00:00:37.809> the

definitely is a broad term probably the

most common cause of lameness is

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.419 
most common cause of lameness is
arthritis<00:00:40.620> obviously<00:00:41.620> lameness<00:00:41.859> is<00:00:42.129> can<00:00:42.280> be<00:00:42.399> a

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
result of an injury so we can have an

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.680 
result of an injury so we can have an
acute<00:00:44.920> lameness<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.579> results<00:00:45.999> from<00:00:46.059> direct

trauma to any area of the leg but
probably<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.949> more<00:00:51.129> common<00:00:51.640> type<00:00:51.879> of

probably the more common type of

probably the more common type of

horse<00:00:53.800> would<00:00:54.039> be<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.489> result<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.449> wear<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.719> tear

horse would be a result of wear and tear

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.770 
horse would be a result of wear and tear
that<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.859> ensues<00:00:57.789> after<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.420> horse's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
that that ensues after the horse's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.630 
that that ensues after the horse's
activities<00:00:59.469> have<00:00:59.710> taken<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.129> toll<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.579> a

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
activities have taken the toll on a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.090 
activities have taken the toll on a
variety<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.149> tissues<00:01:01.569> whether<00:01:02.559> they<00:01:02.739> be<00:01:02.800> soft

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
variety of tissues whether they be soft

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.009 
variety of tissues whether they be soft
tissues<00:01:03.460> or<00:01:03.640> hard<00:01:03.850> tissues<00:01:04.210> or<00:01:04.360> tendons<00:01:04.809> or

tissues or hard tissues or tendons or

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.620 
tissues or hard tissues or tendons or
bones<00:01:05.320> but<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.370> joint<00:01:06.670> seem<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.150> be<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> ones

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
bones but the joint seem to be the ones

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.330 
bones but the joint seem to be the ones
that<00:01:07.750> pay<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.170> price<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.440> most<00:01:08.830> for<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.130> wear

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
that pay the price the most for the wear

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.370 
that pay the price the most for the wear
and<00:01:09.370> tear<00:01:09.640> process<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.390> as<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.050> result

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
and tear process and as a result

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.140 
and tear process and as a result
probably<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.980> most<00:01:12.160> common<00:01:12.580> reason<00:01:12.880> for<00:01:12.910> us

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
probably the most common reason for us

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.820 
probably the most common reason for us
to<00:01:13.270> ever<00:01:13.390> evaluate<00:01:14.020> horses<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:14.470> lameness<00:01:14.620> is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
to ever evaluate horses for lameness is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.700 
to ever evaluate horses for lameness is
because<00:01:15.070> they<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.340> arthritis<00:01:15.670> somewhere<00:01:16.710> so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
because they have arthritis somewhere so

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.510 
because they have arthritis somewhere so
when<00:01:17.920> we<00:01:18.040> start<00:01:18.760> our<00:01:18.850> exam<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:19.390> we<00:01:19.690> start<00:01:19.960> by

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
when we start our exam we we start by

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.250 
when we start our exam we we start by
palpating<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:22.030> soft<00:01:22.270> tissues<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.380> leg<00:01:25.260> so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
palpating the soft tissues of the leg so

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.040 
palpating the soft tissues of the leg so
we<00:01:26.500> primarily<00:01:27.130> palpate<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.020> ligaments<00:01:29.020> that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
we primarily palpate the ligaments that

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.920 
we primarily palpate the ligaments that
are<00:01:29.260> present<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:30.150> cannon<00:01:31.150> bone<00:01:31.300> region<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.810> the

are present in cannon bone region of the

are present in cannon bone region of the
horse<00:01:32.580> this<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:33.730> just<00:01:33.910> very<00:01:33.970> standard

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
horse this is just very standard

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.890 
horse this is just very standard
palpation<00:01:38.370> we<00:01:39.370> compare<00:01:39.820> always<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.720> other

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
palpation we compare always to the other

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.700 
palpation we compare always to the other
side

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
side

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.190

since<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:42.910> horses<00:01:43.240> are<00:01:43.360> likely<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.870> tell<00:01:44.050> us

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200

since the horses are likely to tell us
where<00:01:44.470> things<00:01:44.770> hurt<00:01:45.010> we<00:01:45.280> kind<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.640> need<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:45.790> do

where things hurt we kind of need to do

where things hurt we kind of need to do
it<00:01:46.090> different<00:01:46.840> ways<00:01:49.140> arthritis<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.440> develop

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
associated with your activity let's go

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.200 
associated with your activity let's go
through<00:03:04.390> back<00:03:04.630> palpation<00:03:05.640> back<00:03:06.640> soreness<00:03:07.060> is

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
through back palpation back soreness is

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.770 
through back palpation back soreness is
fairly<00:03:07.420> common<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.020> competitive<00:03:08.710> horses<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
fairly common in competitive horses and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.350 
fairly common in competitive horses and
then<00:03:10.780> coefficient<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.860> rear<00:03:12.010> limbs

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
then coefficient of the rear limbs

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.720 
then coefficient of the rear limbs
follows

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.360 

this<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.690> stifle<00:03:20.560> region<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.190> horse

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
this is the stifle region of the horse

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.930 
this is the stifle region of the horse
and<00:03:22.920> stifles<00:03:23.920> are<00:03:24.040> often<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.519> source<00:03:24.790> of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and stifles are often a source of

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.490 
and stifles are often a source of
lameness<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.450> horses<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.050> we<00:03:26.140> need<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.349> make

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
lameness and horses so we need to make

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.089 
lameness and horses so we need to make
sure<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:28.810> palpate<00:03:29.080> both<00:03:29.500> sides<00:03:29.800> to

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
sure that we palpate both sides to

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.410 
sure that we palpate both sides to
ensure<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> there's<00:03:30.849> not<00:03:30.940> any<00:03:31.000> joint

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
ensure that there's not any joint

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.330 
ensure that there's not any joint
swelling<00:03:31.569> or<00:03:32.019> any<00:03:32.319> pain<00:03:32.769> on<00:03:32.980> palpation<00:03:35.340> we

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
swelling or any pain on palpation we

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.670 
swelling or any pain on palpation we
then<00:03:36.519> will<00:03:36.730> pick<00:03:37.239> up<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.599> rear<00:03:37.750> limbs<00:03:38.050> to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
then will pick up the rear limbs to

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.140 
then will pick up the rear limbs to
palpate<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.190> soft<00:03:39.519> tissues<00:03:39.849> in<00:03:40.000> those<00:03:48.150> owners

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
palpate the soft tissues in those owners

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.880 
palpate the soft tissues in those owners
may<00:03:49.299> not<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.599> able<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.840> recognize<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.379> saddle

lameness but things that they might want

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.270 
lameness but things that they might want
to<00:03:52.959> look<00:03:53.110> for<00:03:53.349> is<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.650> if<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.920> horse<00:03:54.099> has

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
to look for is that if the horse has

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.030 
to look for is that if the horse has
been<00:03:54.459> used<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.420> certain<00:03:55.750> way<00:03:55.930> for<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> period

depending on the activity of the horse

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.690 
depending on the activity of the horse
those<00:04:11.560> may<00:04:11.829> just<00:04:12.040> demonstrate<00:04:12.190> an

and<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:16.150> might<00:04:16.389> be<00:04:16.570> totally<00:04:16.900> incidental

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
and and that might be totally incidental

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.710 
and and that might be totally incidental
or<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.579> might<00:04:18.729> be<00:04:18.760> worth<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.120> phone<00:04:19.269> call<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.630> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
or it might be worth a phone call to the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.879 
or it might be worth a phone call to the
veterinarian<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.320> see<00:04:20.470> if<00:04:20.560> there's<00:04:20.739> something

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
veterinarian to see if there's something

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.100 
veterinarian to see if there's something
else<00:04:21.070> going<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.459> horses<00:04:22.300> usually<00:04:22.540> don't<00:04:22.930> lie

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
else going on horses usually don't lie

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.100 
else going on horses usually don't lie
and<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:24.190> keen<00:04:24.789> owner<00:04:25.030> should<00:04:25.450> obviously

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
and so a keen owner should obviously

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.170 
and so a keen owner should obviously
know<00:04:26.260> their<00:04:26.410> animal<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.979> should<00:04:27.700> recruit<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
know their animal and should recruit the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.340 
know their animal and should recruit the
help<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.570> veterinarian<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:29.110> soon<00:04:29.229> as

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
help of the veterinarian as soon as

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.990 
help of the veterinarian as soon as
possible<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.860> see<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.460> change<00:04:30.850> in

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
possible to see if that change in

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.290 
possible to see if that change in
behavior<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:31.600> related<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.169> lameness<00:04:32.380> issue

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
behavior is related to a lameness issue

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.480 
behavior is related to a lameness issue
next<00:04:34.300> thing<00:04:34.450> is<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.630> put<00:04:35.500> hoof<00:04:35.680> testers<00:04:35.889> on<00:04:36.280> a

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
next thing is to put hoof testers on a

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.650 
next thing is to put hoof testers on a
horse<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.770> horses<00:04:38.770> lay<00:04:38.919> ministers<00:04:39.280> are

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
horse the horses lay ministers are

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.969 
horse the horses lay ministers are
seventy<00:04:40.660> percent<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.139> times<00:04:41.350> originating

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
seventy percent of the times originating

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.730 
seventy percent of the times originating
from<00:04:42.010> originated<00:04:42.880> from<00:04:43.030> their<00:04:43.240> hoof<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.620> it's

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
from originated from their hoof so it's

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.120 
from originated from their hoof so it's
important<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.220> test<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.820> their<00:04:46.330> hopes<00:04:46.570> for

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
important to test that their hopes for

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.120 
important to test that their hopes for
any<00:04:48.130> lameness<00:04:48.460> issues<00:04:49.800> since<00:04:50.800> it's<00:04:50.950> kind<00:04:51.039> of

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
any lameness issues since it's kind of

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.350 
any lameness issues since it's kind of
hard<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> squeeze<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.880> hoof<00:04:52.030> with<00:04:52.240> your

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
hard to squeeze the hoof with your

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.640 
hard to squeeze the hoof with your
fingers<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.840> kind<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.110> have<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.380> use<00:04:53.530> an

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
fingers you kind of have to use an

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.580 
fingers you kind of have to use an
instrument<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.870> instrument<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.350> called

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
instrument and the instrument is called

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.740 
instrument and the instrument is called
a<00:04:56.710> hoof<00:04:56.860> tester<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> we<00:05:01.150> just<00:05:01.330> kind<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.570> work

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
a hoof tester so we just kind of work

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.960 
a hoof tester so we just kind of work
our<00:05:01.930> way<00:05:02.050> around<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.500> hoof<00:05:02.650> while<00:05:03.639> squeezing

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
our way around the hoof while squeezing

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.290 
our way around the hoof while squeezing
to<00:05:04.780> make<00:05:05.080> sure<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:06.849> doesn't<00:05:07.060> have<00:05:07.240> a

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
to make sure that it doesn't have a

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.600 
to make sure that it doesn't have a
painful<00:05:07.660> response<00:05:08.099> this<00:05:09.099> horse<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:09.490> not

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
painful response this horse is not

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.390 
painful response this horse is not
reacting<00:05:10.479> in<00:05:10.570> any<00:05:10.660> way<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:10.960> it

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.430 

so<00:05:18.400> one<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:18.789> things<00:05:19.000> that<00:05:19.319> might<00:05:20.319> have

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
so one of the things that might have

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.080 
so one of the things that might have
come<00:05:20.590> out<00:05:20.740> from<00:05:20.949> watching<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.460> lameness<00:05:21.610> exam

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
come out from watching the lameness exam

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.020 
come out from watching the lameness exam
is<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.599> lameness<00:05:23.259> exams<00:05:23.710> take<00:05:23.979> time<00:05:24.310> they

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
is that lameness exams take time they

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.909 
is that lameness exams take time they
take<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.240> long<00:05:25.629> time<00:05:25.690> as<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.289> matter<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.530> fact<00:05:26.740> in

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
take a long time as a matter of fact in

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.710 
take a long time as a matter of fact in
order<00:05:27.129> to<00:05:27.250> dissect<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:27.849> lameness<00:05:28.060> down<00:05:28.479> to

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
order to dissect the lameness down to

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.649 
order to dissect the lameness down to
where<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.740> originates<00:05:30.340> from<00:05:30.460> one<00:05:31.240> has<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.479> take

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
where it originates from one has to take

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.020 
where it originates from one has to take
the<00:05:31.780> time<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.020> use<00:05:32.860> different<00:05:33.280> surfaces<00:05:33.819> to

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
the time to use different surfaces to

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.640 
the time to use different surfaces to
move<00:05:34.509> horses<00:05:34.930> around<00:05:35.110> because<00:05:35.470> different

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
move horses around because different

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.619 
move horses around because different
terrains<00:05:36.129> will<00:05:36.370> elicit<00:05:36.639> different<00:05:36.970> problems

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
terrains will elicit different problems

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.159 
terrains will elicit different problems
the<00:05:38.229> grass<00:05:38.500> will<00:05:38.800> be<00:05:39.430> more<00:05:39.639> taxing<00:05:40.120> on<00:05:40.270> certain

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
the grass will be more taxing on certain

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.050 
the grass will be more taxing on certain
things<00:05:41.199> like<00:05:41.530> soft<00:05:41.800> tissues<00:05:42.159> versus<00:05:42.789> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
things like soft tissues versus the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.059 
things like soft tissues versus the
concrete<00:05:43.990> might<00:05:44.199> be<00:05:44.319> more<00:05:44.500> taxing<00:05:44.919> on<00:05:45.039> the

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
concrete might be more taxing on the

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.760 
concrete might be more taxing on the
hoof<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.729> so<00:05:46.389> we<00:05:46.810> tend<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.050> use<00:05:47.199> as<00:05:47.349> many<00:05:47.470> tools

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
hoof and so we tend to use as many tools

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.950 
hoof and so we tend to use as many tools
as<00:05:47.979> we<00:05:48.159> can<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.699> get<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.539> root<00:05:49.690> cause<00:05:49.930> of

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
as we can to get to the root cause of

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.659 
as we can to get to the root cause of
the<00:05:50.169> lameness<00:05:50.379> that's<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:51.039> hardest<00:05:51.370> part<00:05:51.580> of

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
the lameness that's the hardest part of

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.850 
the lameness that's the hardest part of
lameness<00:05:51.819> workup<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:52.509> that<00:05:52.659> the<00:05:53.440> horse<00:05:53.650> shows

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
lameness workup is that the horse shows

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.619 
lameness workup is that the horse shows
a<00:05:53.889> lameness<00:05:54.190> on<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.610> limb<00:05:54.879> but<00:05:55.150> you<00:05:55.270> have<00:05:55.419> no

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
a lameness on a limb but you have no

might be coming from the cervical spine
it<00:06:03.879> could<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.509> could<00:06:04.539> be<00:06:04.750> any<00:06:04.900> number<00:06:05.199> of

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
it could it could be any number of

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.619 
it could it could be any number of
places<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:05.860> it's<00:06:06.280> not<00:06:06.430> uncommon<00:06:06.879> at<00:06:07.120> all<00:06:07.270> that

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:07.629 
places and it's not uncommon at all that

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.390 
places and it's not uncommon at all that
we<00:06:08.199> would<00:06:08.379> have<00:06:08.530> clients<00:06:09.009> come<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.310> the

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
we would have clients come to the

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.670 
we would have clients come to the
University<00:06:09.789> and<00:06:10.030> ride<00:06:10.930> their<00:06:11.169> horses<00:06:11.469> and

University and ride their horses and

University and ride their horses and
that's<00:06:12.129> the<00:06:12.250> whole<00:06:12.370> reason<00:06:12.400> why<00:06:12.759> we<00:06:12.909> have<00:06:13.090> this

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
that's the whole reason why we have this

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.140 
that's the whole reason why we have this
lameness<00:06:14.080> area<00:06:14.590> is<00:06:14.740> because<00:06:15.069> they<00:06:15.879> will<00:06:16.060> get

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
lameness area is because they will get

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.700 
lameness area is because they will get
on<00:06:16.210> the<00:06:16.389> horses<00:06:16.719> back<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:17.110> demonstrate

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
on the horses back and demonstrate

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.800 
on the horses back and demonstrate
demonstrate<00:06:18.460> what<00:06:18.639> they<00:06:18.759> actually<00:06:18.909> see<00:06:19.479> when

demonstrate what they actually see when

demonstrate what they actually see when
the<00:06:19.930> horse<00:06:20.110> or<00:06:20.379> feel<00:06:20.650> when<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.069> horse<00:06:21.250> is<00:06:21.310> lame

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
the horse or feel when the horse is lame

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.029 
the horse or feel when the horse is lame
and<00:06:21.909> that's<00:06:22.270> really<00:06:22.509> vital<00:06:22.630> information<00:06:23.039> one

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
and that's really vital information one

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.820 
and that's really vital information one
of<00:06:24.069> the<00:06:24.190> most<00:06:24.370> rewarding<00:06:25.139> ways<00:06:26.139> to<00:06:26.500> to

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
of the most rewarding ways to to

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.920 
of the most rewarding ways to to
identify<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.759> source<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.300> lameness<00:06:28.479> is<00:06:28.779> to

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
identify the source of lameness is to

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.110 
identify the source of lameness is to
have<00:06:29.110> a<00:06:29.440> educated<00:06:30.130> rider<00:06:30.370> on<00:06:30.610> the<00:06:30.729> horse<00:06:30.759> that

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
have a educated rider on the horse that

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.180 
have a educated rider on the horse that
tells<00:06:31.389> you<00:06:31.599> this<00:06:32.169> is<00:06:32.229> what<00:06:32.529> I<00:06:32.560> feel<00:06:32.860> and<00:06:33.099> then

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
tells you this is what I feel and then

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.769 
tells you this is what I feel and then
you<00:06:33.250> can<00:06:33.580> see<00:06:33.849> it<00:06:33.940> from<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.270> ground<00:06:34.300> then<00:06:34.750> you

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
you can see it from the ground then you

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.839 
you can see it from the ground then you
can<00:06:34.960> match<00:06:35.199> the<00:06:36.009> interpretation<00:06:36.639> of<00:06:36.729> the

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
can match the interpretation of the

trainer or the rider with what you're

trainer or the rider with what you're
actually<00:06:38.409> seeing<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.039> then<00:06:39.099> it<00:06:39.250> things<00:06:39.520> make

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
actually seeing and then it things make
