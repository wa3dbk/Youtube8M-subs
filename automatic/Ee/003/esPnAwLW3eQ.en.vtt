00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.730
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.170
 motorcycle station we are today in 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.290
 italy with ama reveals her pizza of 450 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.750
 2014 or alexandre kowalski from 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.920
 yamaha motor france is alexandre who 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 will present us in the big 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.390
 cities 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.550
 the new mercier arnault is 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 true that this new zep of 450 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.280
 2014 these all new in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.660
 motorization in chassis in chief general 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.769
 and especially at the level of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
 motorization today the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.250
 lubrication and wet sump when 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.379
 we were dry sump which yesterday the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.270
 silent was considerably 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.800
 reworked up from the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.050
 technology that was developed by the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.360
 rinaldi team competing with a 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.690
 pau length which today is the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.680
 same as 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.360
 that we know we knew 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.790
 until now except we have more 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.050
 helical system behind and so a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 same length with a silencer 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.380
 much shorter it's true that before 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 we had a helical system that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.630
 tended to heat the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 inventis bottle would be today 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950
 with this vacuum of air there we will not have this 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
 phenomenon at the box level 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 speed she was also reworked 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 the first reports the third 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.810
 report the high engine hague also 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.400
 been prayed and there are also 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.000
 engine curves that are who are 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.100
 different 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 the cio has been considerably 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 reworked also the radiators too 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 are narrower than in the past for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.510
 I would say increase the fineness of this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 machine and then at the level of the center 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.570
 general gravity of the machine on 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.380
 realizes that today there are more 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.420
 tank caps 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 the tank cap is located 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.940
 now under there under the saddle and the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 tank was moved back and abc for 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.870
 have a better center of gravity and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 so allow the pilots to have a 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.429
 agility maneuverability fluidity 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 in the technique more more increased to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.480
 Also note that we have not lost 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.610
 in terms of capabilities since before 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.410
 we were sitting li2o we go up to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
 7.5 of capacity so 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.810
 so here is the case of 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.100
 two air filters which who also 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.750
 been reworked since before he was 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.550
 under the tank today it is 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.860
 placed right next to the column of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.709
 direction and therefore three vices are enough 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120
 to remove and immediately accessed 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.010
 directly to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.269
 to comments and air filters and 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.909
 then also an important point to 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.680
 position level we see the rest 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.420
 feet and is also modified and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.280
 especially the handlebar that today is 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 mounted safe if it's block to allow 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.950
 also to increase the comfort of 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.950
 pilot for this new deal 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.959
 450 2014 which will be available in the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.230
 yamaha network from month of the month 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.489
 August 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.739
 for now the price is not yet 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.060
 release we are working on the tariff 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.590
 is it soon? 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 the best way to check all that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.459
 it is also tried according to me you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.060
 invite to measure just now 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.060
 thank you 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.050
 it 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.940
 little hot debriefing so bind remains 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.910
 remains a motorcycle read he really fired he 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.430
 know what it takes in the engine got 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.210
 there is probably a little too much for the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.980
 common mortals 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.590
 so that's for the configuration 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.400
 standard there is possibility to change the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.710
 mapping thanks to my small tools 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.240
 it allows to humanize this bike and to 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.340
 make it much more enjoyable 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.410
 much more flexible and able 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.200
 roll a few bends at low speeds 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.730
 without being dragged by the flick of 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.780
 piston that one could feel in 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.530
 standard configuration 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.180
 chassis side there is better there is some 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.120
 better on yam safin 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.190
 we feel a little bit more 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.430
 player still to keep his 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.350
 high speed stability it's a rail 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.520
 and stay online yappa there is no 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.310
 not too much to blame him 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.300
 but on the other side, comfort is not 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.760
 the top of the top 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.700
 especially at the fork level it's a 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.860
 little too closed at the beginning of compression 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.010
 that's what tends to really typed in 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.720
 wrists and suddenly when the wheel 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.810
 ahead but to dribble in the entries 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.210
 braking found it's a little 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.800
 complicated but after looking at last 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.930
 finding the right compromise 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.620
 it's much easier we come to 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.990
 to place the bike well it's pretty good 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.300
 that's basically if you want 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.350
 really know everything about the a4 and a half y 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.390
 zdf 2014 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.160
 go on motorcycle-station for 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.160
 the full test go to see you soon 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400
 quick 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.030
 m 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.030
 basically 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.370
 m 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.370
 if a nice guy
