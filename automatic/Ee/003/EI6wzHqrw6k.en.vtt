00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
large biro drawing so far I'm starting

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
large biro drawing so far I'm starting
with<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.120> almost<00:00:42.600> empty<00:00:42.930> pen<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.770> should

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
with an almost empty pen I should

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.500 
with an almost empty pen I should
completely<00:00:44.910> empty<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.719> drawing<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.229 

normally<00:00:51.510> sketch<00:00:51.960> lightly<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> pencil<00:00:53.239> then

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
normally sketch lightly in pencil then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
normally sketch lightly in pencil then
draw<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.840> ink<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.320> erase<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.430> pencil<00:00:56.579> work

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
draw in ink and erase the pencil work

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
draw in ink and erase the pencil work
afterwards<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.440> leave<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> finish<00:00:59.129> drawing

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
afterwards to leave the finish drawing

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.260 
afterwards to leave the finish drawing
nice<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> clean<00:01:00.440> but<00:01:01.440> biro<00:01:02.399> ink<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.879> very

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
nice and clean but biro ink is very

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.380 
nice and clean but biro ink is very
sticky<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.949> smear<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.000> raised

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
sticky and it would smear if I raised

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
sticky and it would smear if I raised
over<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> lay<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> drawing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
over it so I have to lay out the drawing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.430 
over it so I have to lay out the drawing
lightly<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:10.409> Byron<00:01:11.840> there's<00:01:12.840> no<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.409> back

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
lightly with Byron there's no going back

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.640 
lightly with Byron there's no going back
you<00:01:14.860> have<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.280> live<00:01:15.520> with<00:01:15.760> or<00:01:16.540> adapt<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.530> your

you have to live with or adapt to your

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.260 
you have to live with or adapt to your
mistakes<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:23.160> think<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.220> nose<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.730> obvious

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
mistakes I think the nose is the obvious

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.740 
mistakes I think the nose is the obvious
place<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.570> start<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.490> FIR<00:01:27.750> basically

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
place to start the FIR basically

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.880 
place to start the FIR basically
radiates<00:01:29.380> out<00:01:29.710> from<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:30.130> point<00:01:31.890> as

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
radiates out from this point as

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.730 
radiates out from this point as
werewolves<00:01:33.580> are<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.360> popular<00:01:34.930> these<00:01:35.050> days<00:01:35.110> I

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
werewolves are so popular these days I

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.820 
werewolves are so popular these days I
wanted<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.640> add<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> slight<00:01:37.320> werewolf<00:01:38.320> penis<00:01:38.680> to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
wanted to add a slight werewolf penis to

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.330 
wanted to add a slight werewolf penis to
the<00:01:38.860> drawing<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.960> adapted<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.860> mouth<00:01:42.070> a

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the drawing I've adapted the mouth a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.200 
the drawing I've adapted the mouth a
little<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:43.450> slightly<00:01:43.840> flatten<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.770> face<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
little to slightly flatten the face to

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.450 
little to slightly flatten the face to
make<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.480> more<00:01:46.930> kind<00:01:47.290> of<00:01:47.440> humor<00:01:47.980> I<00:01:53.460> couldn't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
make it more kind of humor I couldn't

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.490 
make it more kind of humor I couldn't
find<00:01:54.640> any<00:01:54.940> decent<00:01:55.240> reference<00:01:55.960> for<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.230> paws

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
find any decent reference for the paws

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.950 
find any decent reference for the paws
so<00:01:57.490> I've<00:01:57.610> imagined<00:01:58.150> what<00:01:58.540> they<00:01:58.660> would<00:01:58.810> look

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
so I've imagined what they would look

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.530 
so I've imagined what they would look
like<00:01:59.020> based<00:01:59.500> on<00:01:59.740> pictures<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.430> skeletons<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
like based on pictures of skeletons and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.620 
like based on pictures of skeletons and
an<00:02:02.290> intimate<00:02:03.040> knowledge<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.550> how<00:02:04.030> animal

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
an intimate knowledge of how animal

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.240 
an intimate knowledge of how animal
poles<00:02:05.050> work<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.540> sleep<00:02:07.780> holding<00:02:08.649> poles

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
poles work I get to sleep holding poles

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.210 
poles work I get to sleep holding poles
with<00:02:09.970> my<00:02:10.149> cat<00:02:10.540> who<00:02:11.260> likes<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.650> sleep<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:12.070> my

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
with my cat who likes to sleep on my

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.750 
with my cat who likes to sleep on my
chest

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
chest

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.650 
chest
it's<00:02:13.570> sad<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.250> true

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.960 

now<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> always<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.100> eyes<00:02:23.280> drawn

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
now I always like to get the eyes drawn

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.020 
now I always like to get the eyes drawn
earlier<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:25.470> creates<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.100> connection<00:02:26.550> with

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
earlier this creates a connection with

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.110 
earlier this creates a connection with
the<00:02:27.150> drawing<00:02:27.920> once<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.100> eyes<00:02:29.280> are<00:02:29.640> there<00:02:29.819> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the drawing once the eyes are there I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.020 
the drawing once the eyes are there I
fill<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.540> joint<00:02:30.780> speaks<00:02:31.230> back<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.920> me<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:33.000> are

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
fill the joint speaks back to me we are

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.240 
fill the joint speaks back to me we are
then<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.840> conversation<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
then in a conversation about how to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
then in a conversation about how to
proceed

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.090 

really<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.510> drawing<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.650> all<00:02:40.860> about

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
really this drawing is all about

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.420 
really this drawing is all about
following<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.760> direction<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> firm
