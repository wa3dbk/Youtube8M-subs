00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
or less what I use it for so we're going

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
or less what I use it for so we're going
to<00:01:48.330> go<00:01:48.479> through<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.080> I'll<00:01:49.530> demonstrate<00:01:49.799> just

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to go through and I'll demonstrate just

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.669 
to go through and I'll demonstrate just
a<00:01:50.759> little<00:01:51.000> bit<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.209> how<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.539> works<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
a little bit of how it works and some of

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:01.660 
a little bit of how it works and some of
the<00:01:52.740> features<00:01:54.770> by<00:01:55.770> making<00:01:56.810> just<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.899> quick<00:01:58.080> logo

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.249
