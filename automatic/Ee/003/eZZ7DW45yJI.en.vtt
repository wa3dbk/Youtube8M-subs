00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
spending without making a drastic change

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.420 
spending without making a drastic change
in<00:00:37.840> their<00:00:37.989> lifestyle<00:00:38.380> well<00:00:38.920> that's<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.220> key<00:00:39.399> I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
in their lifestyle well that's the key I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.580 
in their lifestyle well that's the key I
think<00:00:39.520> not<00:00:39.970> making<00:00:40.480> these<00:00:40.630> drastic<00:00:41.230> changes

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
think not making these drastic changes

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.740 
think not making these drastic changes
because<00:00:41.890> they're<00:00:42.070> hard<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.370> stick<00:00:42.579> to<00:00:42.760> but<00:00:43.480> on

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
because they're hard to stick to but on

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.479 
because they're hard to stick to but on
our<00:00:43.899> show<00:00:44.050> we<00:00:44.200> work<00:00:44.380> with<00:00:44.470> a<00:00:44.530> lot<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.860> families

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
and we find where they're spending the

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.810 
and we find where they're spending the
most<00:00:47.140> money<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.739> in<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.129> miscellaneous

with<00:00:53.949> miscellaneous<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.730> first<00:00:54.940> thing<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.179> do

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
with miscellaneous the first thing to do

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.479 
with miscellaneous the first thing to do
is<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.660> go<00:00:55.839> through<00:00:55.870> your<00:00:56.170> expenses<00:00:56.859> and<00:00:57.100> it

is to go through your expenses and it

is to go through your expenses and it
sounds<00:00:57.910> like<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.149> time<00:00:58.390> consuming<00:00:58.420> but<00:00:59.079> it's

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
sounds like it's time consuming but it's

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.290 
sounds like it's time consuming but it's
definitely<00:00:59.739> worth<00:00:59.949> it<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.339> say<00:01:00.550> do<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.149> need

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
was starting a money group and that's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.679 
was starting a money group and that's
something<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.740> anyone<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.520> do<00:01:45.729> so

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
something that anyone can do so

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.420 
something that anyone can do so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
essentially the five of us came together

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.450 
essentially the five of us came together
to<00:01:48.939> hold<00:01:49.600> each<00:01:49.719> other<00:01:49.899> accountable<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:51.009> help
