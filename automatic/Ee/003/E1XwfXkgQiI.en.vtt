using a heal zombie to be able to heal
you<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.910> game<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.570> able<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

full<00:00:52.440> health<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.399> thought<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
full health and I thought this was a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
full health and I thought this was a
really<00:00:54.449> good<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> game

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really good thing to put into the game

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.860 
really good thing to put into the game
because<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.010> course<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.090> damaged<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
because of course if you got damaged you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.599 
because of course if you got damaged you
then<00:00:58.050> need<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> change<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.739> play<00:00:59.010> style<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
then need to change your play style a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
then need to change your play style a
little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.090> by<00:01:00.449> either<00:01:00.719> trying<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
little bit by either trying to get to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
little bit by either trying to get to
something<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.190> heal<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.789> or<00:01:03.030> trying

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
something that can heal you up or trying

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
something that can heal you up or trying
to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.409> little<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.979> cautious<00:01:05.430> because

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to be a little bit more cautious because

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
to be a little bit more cautious because
of<00:01:05.850> course<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.810> full<00:01:07.110> health

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of course you are only on full health

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
of course you are only on full health
and<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.920> may<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.250> against<00:01:08.909> enemies

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and you may be going against enemies

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
and you may be going against enemies
that<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.810> full<00:01:10.080> health<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.070> less

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that are on full health so you are less

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
that are on full health so you are less
likely<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.030> able<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.540> win<00:01:12.750> that

health system brought back to the game

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.960 
health system brought back to the game
it<00:01:49.140> made<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.220> strategic<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it made a little bit more strategic and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
it made a little bit more strategic and
of<00:01:51.240> course<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.810> once<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.470> half<00:01:52.740> health

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
of course then once you are half health
you<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.270> more

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you have to be a little bit more

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
you have to be a little bit more
cautious<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.409> course<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> cannot<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cautious and of course you cannot just

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
cautious and of course you cannot just
run<00:01:56.340> away<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> full<00:01:57.570> health

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
run away and then get you full health

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
run away and then get you full health
and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> come<00:01:58.469> back<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> few

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
and then just come back in and get a few
more<00:01:59.790> vanquishes<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.509> liked<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> was

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
more vanquishes I liked it that it was

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
more vanquishes I liked it that it was
only<00:02:01.920> two<00:02:02.159> half<00:02:02.369> health<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> did

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
only two half health because then it did

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
only two half health because then it did
make<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.619> challenging

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
make it a little bit more challenging

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.950 
make it a little bit more challenging

half<00:02:09.270> health<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.080> took<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.709> bit

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
half health and it took a little bit

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.130 
half health and it took a little bit
more<00:02:10.979> skill<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> gameplay<00:02:12.840> reveal

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

health in his Tzemach or maybe heal him
at<00:03:04.830> all<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.520> we<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.900> course

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
at all that we do not know and of course

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.080 
at all that we do not know and of course
I<00:03:07.320> would<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.890> find<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.220> out<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
I would like to find that out but the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
I would like to find that out but the
reason<00:03:09.450> why<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.690> do<00:03:09.870> prefer<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.650> half<00:03:11.040> health

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
reason why I do prefer the half health

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.370 
reason why I do prefer the half health
system<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.820> like<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.180> said<00:03:12.240> before<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.080> gives<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
system is like I said before it gives it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.290 
system is like I said before it gives it
a<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:13.920> strategic<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.640> this

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
a little bit more strategic and this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.210 
a little bit more strategic and this
could<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> huge<00:03:16.080> game-changer<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.130> of

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
could be a huge game-changer and of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.460 
could be a huge game-changer and of
course<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.550> developers<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.209> work<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.110> few

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
course the developers a work that a few

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.080 
course the developers a work that a few
of<00:03:19.560> us<00:03:19.650> don't<00:03:20.100> really<00:03:20.310> like<00:03:20.610> this<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.000> of

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
of us don't really like this but of

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.420 
of us don't really like this but of
course<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.450> minority<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.320> not<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.890> overall

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
course a minority is not on the overall

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.400 
course a minority is not on the overall
population<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> reason<00:03:24.989> why<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
population so that is the reason why I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.530
