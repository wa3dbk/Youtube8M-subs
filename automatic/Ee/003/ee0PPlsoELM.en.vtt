00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.210
 hi to all with that of tess 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.219
 mobile.fr show mwc 2015 on the stand 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.180
 alcatel and I have in front of me the pop 10 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.980
 years top 10 and a 10 inch tablet that 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.600
 yes just above and then we have 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.460
 also a keyboard associated so we're going 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.770
 look at both I have the impression that 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.270
 it's a little bit the flagship product 20 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.000
 it is not the flagship product at alcatel 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.930
 he is the idol 3 also 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.070
 but in terms of tablets that's true 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.880
 that lately we often see 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.649
 tablet + keyboard combinations 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.140
 date not yesterday but here I have already seen 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.989
 not bad at mwc so it's a tablet 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.050
 which will cost 159 euros which must come out in 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.140
 April and the keyboard will all cost 30 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.960
 it 's 10 inches it's 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.570
 compatible 4g ​​quad core 1.2 5 megapixel 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.489
 ariane battery of 4000 60 million 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.110
 lose then after good as you can 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.030
 to see it is a product that turns 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.750
 on android so we'll watch this all 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.610
 now we'll start with 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.530
 remove it then you have a small 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.729
 connector here I pull too hard ago 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.290
 everything from that so that's okay 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.030
 to make it sound in every way that 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.340
 is going to be problematic so we 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.600
 removed that here and then we release the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.789
 tablet finally this is then she has 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020
 the air of turning way turns under the bed 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.549
 pop is good it's really fun 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.289
 there are a lot of products under the bed 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.880
 pop this year it's okay you go 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.209
 tell me but it's still a good 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.929
 thing 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.100
 so here is an interface that 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.959
 works both ways we will 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.579
 stay in landscape to for the for the 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.560
 taken in hand so what is it 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.539
 on the side you see will not see very 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 well maybe there with the focus that goes 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.200
 to be difficult but concretely you 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.459
 have the volume lock unlock 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.539
 the camera the connectors for the 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.639
 for the keyboard so it's just for 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.919
 the game just think for them 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.939
 detect and again I do not know in 

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:51.409
 does why and connectors because 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.200
 that finally it is from what 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.590
 said the person is a keyboard 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.329
 bluetooth 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.679
 so the connectors maybe it's 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.119
 just to hold it up I do not know 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.799
 maybe provide information 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.860
 also you can put the cimade 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.979
 microsd justice 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.790
 micro usb down finally well yeah that's it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.379
 down there actually we have a 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.909
 we have an infrared management lalanne 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.439
 infrared transmitter infrared sensors 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:22.230
 and the jack after interface side we're going 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.930
 look at that hop here could go from 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.879
 call 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.700
 toc that way there you compose your 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.200
 number you can make a call 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.730
 here it is very pretty here 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.420
 any case with this wallpaper I find 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 it's very nice 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.299
 look at camera what it's worth 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.329
 interface term oualata that resume 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.459
 a snapshot quickly small menu la 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.849
 appears with the option to adjust 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.530
 what mode manual hdr fashion night sport 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.120
 size of the picture is back to definition 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.819
 but damn give you numbers 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.169
 that said you saw the 0 function 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.419
 singer delays 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.159
 the menu is pretty nice so here is 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.659
 this is for this part of me what 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.579
 I'm also interested to see it is if we have 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.470
 specific interfaces for the mode 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.120
 tablet os we'll go see here then 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.229
 what do we have the browser called 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.709
 a master key preinstalled I imagine 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:26.659
 we do not have no mail I 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.069
 do not know if I'm got is no no 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.109
 what are we going to see if we can access 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.760
 messages eventually if I get to 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.109
 find them 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 the calendar that can be interesting 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.889
 to see on a tablet here it is 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.090
 looks like that's not it I do not think 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.829
 whether that is what it is that the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.190
 basic calendar in the non-pop bed 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.169
 in one year 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.389
 now they had to have it's 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:49.199
 the old version is either a 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.600
 version proposed by alcatel la 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.820
 music we have a reader 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.420
 dedicated musical but in addition we have 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:06.770
 sure we have plenty of music of course that's the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.770
 music like that here's it 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.790
 yeah there's not much more to say 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.549
 life of words to look at words of the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.720
 product I do not find the ski message 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.070
 but maybe it's me who suffers gleut 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.530
 that's because it's not messages 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.270
 I think otherwise it's emails hockey 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.680
 whatever it is it looks like 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.180
 this is the tablet looks like this and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.920
 after behind good here I can not 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.100
 then not pick it up but you have the 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.680
 you have keyboard you can hop you 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.470
 connect that way there you the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.600
 see it's set it's connected and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.880
 and then you have one here 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.170
 see there is the cursor watching it at 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.470
 sun level no it's not a 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.050
 fly 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.220
 that's enough the cursor is so with the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.320
 slider me I'm not necessarily 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.900
 convinced by the idea of ​​having a slider 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.280
 either under android because finally 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.400
 to do the care and then it's not so 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.650
 easy that that there are the limits on the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.080
 web surfing web it can be nice but 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.790
 I do not see too much why not at the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520
 limit which then you have a keyboard 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.050
 to more or less complete so that's the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.730
 shot at herti leading an azerty and then 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.020
 is where you see them not saying if I 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.730
 maybe zoom in and a little bit 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.870
 but it may be complicated what 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.460
 I can not pick it up actually 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.000
 In any case, it is in any case 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.169
 so you have search keys 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.970
 back the sidelines that 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.260
 allow to manipulate interface that's 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.680
 it will be pretty much all one for this 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.660
 presentation of the pop 10,2 alcatel at 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.919
 mwc 2015 if you have any questions 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.919
 do not hesitate to see you soon
