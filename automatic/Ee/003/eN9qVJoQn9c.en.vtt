00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
some more case reviews so i guess a good

some more case reviews so i guess a good
fit<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.400> finish<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:35.549> covers<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> bezel

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869

so when you set it down like this it's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.429 
so when you set it down like this it's
actually<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.939> tables<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.869> touching<00:01:43.320> the
