00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.633
 People love the final answers. 

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.570
 We really want to have a clear understanding of the things we see. 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.539
 Especially historians of art. 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.508
 But people also love to do things. 

00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:15.727
 We love to make art. 

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:19.229
 And one of the oldest works of the discovery so far open 

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:21.067
 is a small female figure 

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:23.650
 which is sometimes called a female naked body, 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.709
 but known as the Villendorf Venera - 

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.845
 a name that does not have any meaning, 

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.499
 but it really shows the lens our culture is watching. 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.553
 It was named after Venus when it was discovered in 1908 

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:39.468
 in a village in Austria called Wilndorf. 

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:42.011
 It is about 11 centimeters long 

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.340
 and dates back about 25,000 years. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.269
 She is really old. 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.444
 And at the Vienna Museum, 

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:52.637
 where we observe it in the Natural History Museum, 

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:56.798
 shrouded in darkness, in a glass box, 

00:00:56.798 --> 00:00:58.549
 illuminated from above. 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.916
 Outside it looks like a Greek temple 

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:04.211
 and he writes "Villendorf Venus". 

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.015
 Actually there is a small button in the temple, 

00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:08.594
 because it is still a scientific museum, 

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:11.419
 many kids love buttons. 

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:15.535
 And when they do, the white light on the figurine turns red 

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:17.251
 and music from the flute is heard. 

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.104
 Now, of course, we have no idea whether these people are listening to the music, 

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:21.467
 what would that music be?
