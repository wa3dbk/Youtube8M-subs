00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.430
 somehow own brand 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.430

 find out whether he needs this brand or not 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 need he tried to cross the attraction 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.560
 the master that received from the unequivocal 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.560
 thereafter 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.970
 we decided to try 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.390
 get no 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 the internet 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.100
 It turned out that in order to choose 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.690
 Moscow 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.390
 through the Internet 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.010
 actually do it 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.330
 not so easy 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 most sites 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590
 refers to Turkmen from here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.830
 in a matchmaker site to 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.510
 just write it down 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.800
 with car 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.670
 what are the requirements for this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.610
 car systems 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.670
 I myself 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.860
 Russia client 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.540
 for the common man it's hard enough 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.380
 because they are not ready to perceive 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.120
 such information 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.840
 in this situation it took 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 another clues we had an idea 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.610
 just went to the store 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.920
 sad leisure 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.230
 really they each know it 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.230
 in response shelf strength 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 km 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:34.869
 Well 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:35.979
 as you can see 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.459
 sellers can't say anything either 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.999
 specifically 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.699
 as a rule, they also apply different 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.839
 sentence and 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.129
 who are working stores today 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.999
 most of them 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.259
 I suppose enough information 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.239
 as everybody 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.609
 by what principle 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.259
 they are also going to the same standard 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.809
 schemes 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.569
 Yes 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.289
 visiting specialists 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:05.069
 specialized resources on the Internet 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.609
 sites 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.219
 just added 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.589
 maybe all the same let's turn to the main 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.229
 document on his car 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.119
 service 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.149
 too much 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.749
 let's see what is recommended 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.349
 manufacturer for our car 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.620
 Nissan Maxim 2000 second year with 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.620
 mileage of 160 thousand kilometers 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.469
 open but 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:30.999
 to our surprise 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:34.329
 we just see 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.030
 class isaev gaydamak 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.229
 30 p 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.249
 without a suit 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.349
 and the quality of the mass should not be below 1 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.449
 in USA 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.639
 complicated 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.449
 and which one to fix us 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.709
 pick up 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.409
 can take the original Moscow 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.569
 which is sold today under stores 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.579
 Nissan brand 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.329
 it turns out there are two Nisan oils 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.559
 kinds of we can buy plastic canister 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.839
 secularity 5 40 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.769
 we can buy asian secularity 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.329
 50 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.749
 for a simple drag on so what 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.179
 we still did 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.179
 campus then you and me woman 19 years old 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.769
 Very little can be done in this situation. 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.049
 with the exception of 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.049
 same to someone 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.099
 asian 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.259
 European and American 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.259
 the only thing that can happen 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.139
 such information 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.969
 what interval 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.069
 we use for replacement after all 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.069
 also worked 160 thousand kilometers 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:40.790
 in the orphanage 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.790
 maybe something 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:46.930
 and not all 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.800
 not every one of them can 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.490
 so say we can't get 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.029
 how can I take into account what the engines went 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.860
 most of the already changed 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.580
 most car owners of their 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.460
 daughters 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.350
 even if he has a car on the verge 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.509

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.509
 he requires thomas in which it is written 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.910
 Then it is surprised that Thomas is enough 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.159
 quickly 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.339
 Twente this information is confirmed then 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.379
 prefers could not 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.409
 no mechanic is alone 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.979
 the seller is sorry there yet 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.979
 alcohol in this regard could not
