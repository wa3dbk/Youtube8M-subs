this reversal and I got the court cover
he<00:03:16.459> looks<00:03:16.700> funny<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.989> odds<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.260> him<00:03:18.410> is

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
he looks funny but the odds of him is

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.690

straight down the line from his

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.370 
straight down the line from his
positioning<00:03:20.239> he'll<00:03:20.569> probably<00:03:20.720> hit<00:03:21.080> straight

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
positioning he'll probably hit straight

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.949 
positioning he'll probably hit straight
in<00:03:21.470> front<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.709> him<00:03:21.830> he<00:03:22.010> went<00:03:22.400> cross<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.660> read
