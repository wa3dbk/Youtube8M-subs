 It's so unbearably hot 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.329
 but they definitely play borderlands 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.180
 must or must stream and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.739
 that the bikini or yes is then 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 Of course she also likes to do that 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 if she is absolutely naked in front of the pc 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.829
 sit by that but the camera is allowed there 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.480
 finished just 40 days is also 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.610
 understandable if at youporn 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.110
 have you ever webcam nudists 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 problems for example with chat 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 roulette or switch or where others 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 pages we do not know or find 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.380
 She writes the regulation of tweets well 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380
 us that time 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.420
 if at all 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.829
 waging 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.729
 then you come a little 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.350
 a little goose bumps 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.060
 the new tv trailer to assassin's creed 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.830
 ii is really not from bad parents 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.330
 above all quite impressive masses 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.710
 Just take him to Paris in Munich 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.659
 and the french revolution is going on 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 historically probably do not occur 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.049
 and quite correct but hey there we see 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.840
 in the geisenfelder just over it 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.670

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 do not need sparkle 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.519
 Last year, rtl games was that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.580
 sometimes walking dead a game too 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.720
 of thrones oh so announced this 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.110
 year but after this message came 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 Somehow nothing more, well, I fans 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.450
 already expected that that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.440
 probably will not because it is yes 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.060
 finally in october respectively 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.130
 october almost over so the year 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.049
 Almost thought wrong 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 telltale games for now could be the game 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.350
 of thrones iron france actually 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.670
 this year will still appear 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.019
 but there is an exact date 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.790
 not yet but hey many options 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.709
 do not stay anymore now 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.390
 we are still looking forward to it 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.070
 the game and hope that it at least 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.380
 to the level of the well of tomorrow 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.489
 when walking under it will come the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.690
 I have to mention again because they are so 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.609
 are cool and we also need 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.150
 urgently a gap filler up to 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.230
 Next season series that is waiting is so 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.640
 corrosive, at least I'm talking now 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 just for a game of throne fans 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.700
 for example for me because of me 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.810
 I'm really looking forward to the new one 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.370
 season you are already looking forward to the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.859
 new season and joy has the theater 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 game because i love the games of those 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.319
 are all great just me from where 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.269
 magath but also what you have to 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.530
 Monkey Island have done so great 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.000
 or left rita also super so the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.079
 make cool things the boys and now 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440
 I am very curious what is with 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.440
 futures 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:39.500
 and there we had to hard 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.030
 Negotiations and any amount 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.280
 potential actor sizes stands 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.379
 It finally almost warmer 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.569
 as a doctor will play strange and no 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.390
 it 's neither ryan gosling nor squatting in 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.459
 phoenix cook little yes true 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.040
 reeves or johnny dork are not synonymous 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.049
 and I'm not even before God what 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.650
 is because then why would be through the 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.510
 Not 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.760
 yes but many when they think you know why 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.569
 Are not they no? I wonder 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.180
 why are you not? 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.560
 but that's enough in the script 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.030
 is now because either a lot 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.489
 But better is martin would be the better 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.799
 choice but apparently it is 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.320
 now at sherlock holmes really everything 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.030
 Apparently after the honor he gives plays 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.080
 the over-the- top and ingenious magician of 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.539
 Was invented by stanley in 1963 for the 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.070
 in july 2016 provided film and 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.530
 probably in some others as well 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.580
 always beyond we know but too 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:45.620
 help policy yes here and there 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:47.479

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.340
 I'm stupid rubber we see 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.039
 by the way, again in his latest one 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.919
 film of the imitation game maybe something 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.050
 as I january 2050 starts its 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.030
 drama in the second world war in which he 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.919
 a mathematician plays us one 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.870
 German coding machine should crack 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.220
 here maybe the coach run quietly 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.330
 that one vote continues to me everything 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.650

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.919
 Marwitz times or told someone else 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:18.310
 would have been better adapted as for 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.310
 for martin I ask you oh 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.100

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.810
 to share his journey and to be curious 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.250
 his 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.340
 this man within a few days 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.080
 namely exactly three his side over 17 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.270
 million likes trend continues to rise 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.860
 and he did not lank that far there 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.420
 no, he even has a little video for 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.820
 ice-track challenge online 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.930
 who did not graduate because of it 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.000
 for him because of his physical 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.740
 conditions have been a little dangerous 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 would be or circumstances for it but 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.830
 his three children jumped in and 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.950

 thoughts still post on facebook 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.050
 if you do not have the 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.820
 physicist or mathematician is getting 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.760
 not so much you would 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.710
 follow his side and you have 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:36.550
 ever read his books why 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:37.390
 me that now that is a duck and 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.640

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:50.250
 enough press on it we had it
