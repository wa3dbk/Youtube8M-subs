00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.870
 this tutorial we will learn how to make a stopwatch a counter one counts 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.219
 back percent 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.570
 in yemen comes tutu to do cortito because I will not explain how it is done 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.819
 I'm just going to teach a bed 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:18.849
 because if they are things that are already repeated another tutorial in coughing goes very 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:19.820
 ahead 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 first we have to create 13 flat ones he answered as already 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.439
 I know that with the title of how to use text bendine 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.250
 in each plane the dinner mona own texts that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.040
 it was necessary for what the project this 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.140
 i also add a property and mexico do this because 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.380
 is pressed we will win I am a little bit require the property 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 and we say of type times and we name it as 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.620
 sorry 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.610
 imer tiny all 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.800
 ok with that is enough 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 for we removed a python code here done it creates them for martÃ­n has estimated 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.010
 today that marks first let's see the first 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 and it takes us and month 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.780
 seven dates line 100 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.620
 almost always has to 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.350
 first room that a program appears in python already commented yale objects 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 import the module d and on the east prescription in 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.720
 the preferred are not to call the buyer 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 call the owner 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.300
 the owner from now odom refers to the plan to this plan 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.980
 before the owner the program say tested leisure 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.080
 this plan 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.810
 now we calculate the minutes 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 with this account 10 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 at a point they have means that we take the value 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.230
 of the property times 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.550
 from the owner of wanting this plane 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.190
 and today we live for 60 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.920
 this order says that what we did not know what we agreed on we turned hunter an interest and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.720
 he took off 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.970
 done the same thing but what we take here is the rest of the vision levi's 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.380
 60 I think I'm not too sure 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.810
 and then before heart and you second 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 the weather the property text this property text what is it going to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.910
 reflect the text 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.309
 subway 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.439
 I'll remember her yes 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.779
 that is, if this is drought, we write 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.279
 a text that is 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.629
 your consumptions p 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 this is the text that appears 2 3 4 5 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.489
 If you put a defendant, what's going on, but yes 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.229
 we associate efe 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.119
 program was just doing that 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.109
 what st we were not here at 30 'promised not to dod program 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.339
 during the program 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:35.839
 during the executive execution of the game and what do they want kylie 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.019
 the minutes 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.209
 converted into text format that is necessary for it to stay because 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.730
 these 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.950
 of the type sprint this st to feast text 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.639
 plus two points to be the shape of the pro 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.130
 this through this what it does is add 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.059
 a zero 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.959
 when second they do not reach 10 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.879
 yes the seconds 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.609
 cores we've got 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.439
 this plane crashes first from above that when we listen p we stick 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.899
 a stopwatch 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.609
 this earthquake is not another 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.429
 a choir mentros a chronometer with decimals 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.319
 and the countdown 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.539
 bland as to explain 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.039
 little ball the code 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.229
 of the chronometer this program the coleim decimals 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:18.689
 that is, for hamas 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.689
 there are markets 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.129
 which is practically the same as the other 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.729
 jay who should add 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.659
 the lehendakari has found here the owner 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.189
 between lines because the roles are added in a single line but the same is true 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.509
 proprietary 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:36.339
 the count 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:41.119
 the owner of the controller there on the label of them in our 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.379
 line so bad 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.839
 the same will do 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.799
 tenth minute same as before twelfth to the cante already stopped 10a 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.129
 in this way it is worth 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.129
 like the seconds 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.829
 percent 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.649
 the safe among other seconds 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:02.749
 rc 60 because it also does not matter much how the account is made 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.549
 that's how the eleventh is defined 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.349
 and after the text diaper and very good sing minute 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.939
 seconds 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.009
 tenths 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.919
 one leaves by ekin 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.919
 to this we must add 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.539
 it does not matter much either because this this event what produced the download 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.080
 in my blog 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.669
 worth a hundred is actually going on youtube or somewhere else 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.300
 know that my rogers 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.819
 this address 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.069
 efe and yes no 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:36.960
 together with bloggers 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.509
 dot com 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.189
 ok here you can download this file and see 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.289
 I wrote other comments in the forum the copenhagen onu 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.629
 bimbo in a role that does not give pink 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.470
 good group 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.050
 I can be like that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.000
 and scratch 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.240
 of that he adds 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.240
 a program comment then do not program 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.800
 if we press pm 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.529
 there we go we know that we are the same as before 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.529
 the problem and wait in addition shows the 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.469
 the tenth to tenth of a second 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.689
 and finally we will see third what is 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.839
 I promised myself Tuesday 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.839
 what is a countdown 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.020
 the kohl's program 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.889
 just as before you enter the owner does not align 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.800
 and now adela variable textual timer to 300 - the time is to say now the time 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.699
 is counting 300 back 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.830
 after a hundred second for example second is five minutes 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.949
 then time kander sin 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.580
 times is fixed in 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.879
 let's see if we have 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.279
 this turned on or should I correct proper 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.360
 we quote is 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.180
 pressed 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.080
 let's remove in this one 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.800
 leo santa de destatis on twitter 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.949
 devastated pulsed means that it will look like the baradei of this property of 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.689
 luxury 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.089
 the time up there 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.869
 Hosting them a little better 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:08.949
 that puts planets point timer like you have to teach the time that's a bit 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:09.939
 for 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.069
 that will be seen later during the game so that such program knows what the 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.210
 property worth 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.409
 all this to this one of the property 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.339
 with usual bavaria although in this case it is that the time simply because that 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.719
 is a kilometer that is counting 1 two was going up will place 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.789
 that's where we get the data 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.629
 to make the account 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.729
 that ended there i already showed the chronometer how we want it wrong 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.740
 Well, to see what we say is that 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.919
 there's going to be a SMEs property that make 300 baa match that people drink and 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.219
 subtracting the second colon going on 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.259
 this set times not only as the department passed does another teacher 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.419
 90% 198 and so 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.449
 with which according to data to which that time is activated 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.879
 it's a second I turned it mann who second 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.120
 and then we write it in its proper format 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.559
 Well nothing said that is what it was 

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:02.930
 pulsar p 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.930
 and there is that it is to increase start of 5000 gazette 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.629
 a countdown that believes to have mere time 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:12.509
 who believes that only minutes of stories another 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.669
 when the background is 60 seconds 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.300
 he proposed insistent owns the stretch a myth countdown 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 quique gives you minutes as much as 120 seconds 

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.839
 and countdown bar explains hevia second quarter of second 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.439
 of the second bridge another 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.399
 as serious 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:34.859
 Well, I've done nothing to make man simple, you just have to apply 

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:35.649
 piton 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:41.089
 the country see the code and it is that they speak so crazy and they charge of saying in this appointment 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:42.110
 without water 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.110
 of course but the first team with a point the easter 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.969
 thank you 

00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:47.729
 Finish tutoring
