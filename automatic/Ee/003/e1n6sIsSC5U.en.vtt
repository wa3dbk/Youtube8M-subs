00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 but I interrupt you because I arrived here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 down row curly then in the meantime what is it 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.580
 state of mind you played you gave 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.650
 everything was seen until the last juve 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.929
 it is stronger 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.910
 yes we must admit it at the end of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 accounts that surely have been more 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.400
 strong better at exploiting first 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.060
 that occasion that is a bit yes when you do 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 he could avoid 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.359
 that's why we got the ball 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.910
 we tried to play the ball from 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 from behind and nothing then it was enough not 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.740
 attention that has failed in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740
 that moment 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 and here they will be in the pink sample 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.200
 that we know that a half really is enough 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.420
 comma and they throw it in, though, right there 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 so I think it's a lot 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 balanced we counted very well 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.890
 we tried to put difficulties 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.730
 below in the first half we are also 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.730
 succeeded and we have granted little for which 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 certainly a little hurts because there 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 they were so keen to give first 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.170
 nice match for our fans who 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.820
 they also came today we are richter in 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.869
 that stage but nothing is repeating us of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.869
 he explains sorry to all 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.210
 however as three people to be thrown away indeed 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.790
 I think we saw a bologna 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 ambitious trying to play football 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 even against a strong opponent like the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 juve you feel you are not in the field 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.899
 saved and was a match 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 rather harsh fouls kicked 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.210
 calcetti on both sides sums been 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 match post has been seen up 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 at the last as you said we have it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 we fought tried to fight 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 I had to go on the ball on a ball 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.340
 as if it were the last and cabbage sometimes 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 they are also part of the game i 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.940
 kick the right yellow cards 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.580
 Left maybe some of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.310
 the war in the middle of the field for which there is 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.050
 front seemed quite angry at 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.710
 a certain point a bit nervous maybe for 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.820
 so many beats took the top of it for me 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.740
 he must see it as a compliment 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.510
 why more when we a 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.950
 player takes so many kicks means 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.660
 that the opponent fears for which I think 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.250
 whether it is more a compliment to him is 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.229
 question of all this point of view 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.850
 that maybe something they took of 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.520
 sight 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.020
 if they target you it means that it is there 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.110
 something that most people don't have 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.130
 compared to the others however he was good 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.440
 anyway to keep the blow 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.110
 we were good according to me and all a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.940
 hold a blow and then eventually stay there 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:32.110
 here to take against the juve in my opinion 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 we have to stand stubbornly lost 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:45.090
 entered it can not be given 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.220
 it will never be the single fault because 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.840
 eventually in the field we love if we go in 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.300
 eleven e 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.430
 so if we win we win together if 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.670
 let's lose lose together for sure 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.950
 given that the first goal we have 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.870
 got it when they changed form though 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.069
 I would not say now that maybe this 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 has conditioned us 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.900
 no decision to take the coach 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.510
 he definitely wants to do the best for 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.390
 for his own team and is looking for 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.310
 to field players in one 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.890
 sure of course a form that according to him 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.690
 improve the team or maybe 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.810
 let him take the lead targeted 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.019
 then football made for the episodes is also 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.269
 at the moment it was he who is not there 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.780
 been pretty close to vucinic though 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.430
 no fault in anyone else we have 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.549
 lost we made a point e match 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.549
 that's enough 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.250
 goes well live especially for 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.200
 ask yourself if you had perception 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.209
 pegs seems to have complained at the end 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.150
 contest of elation of count also said 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.100
 more times it takes respect and even later 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.930
 they tried to make it clear in reality 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.459
 Count turned a deaf ear 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.049
 while pegs says that in short at home 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.489
 of others it would take respect according to him 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.780
 there was an excessive exultation one 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.769
 perception that you also had since 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.989
 field already starting with which is mine 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.340
 answer this plus a stuff for you to 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.430
 to discuss risk of want 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.870
 discuss you these things here though 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.459
 the concept of the coach for me is 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.910
 just right anyway at home 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.770
 at home our security is not pleasing to 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.500
 being the coach makes gestures that it is 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.599
 then again I don't know if it's a gesture made a 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.789
 place to make our fans angry 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.530
 or to us or to miss the 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.110
 respect because sometimes it does the 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.210
 things anyway that maybe after one 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.139
 victory there is also that one turns out 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.690
 but if it was done in a manner we say 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.280
 smart and in quotation marks then 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.020
 surely we don't like to say coli is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.910
 gone practically no respect 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.220
 but I repeat this is a speech that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.630
 you must do it and leave it to you if 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.490
 you want to ask the questions of the game 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.199
 these things 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.780
 I also leave my colleagues or later 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.050
 normalized so far you have questions for 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.050
 the boy 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.490
 but I believe 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.769
 for me the word restart is not right 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.299
 because as I said before 

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.369
 game for me was not a part 

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:27.899
 negative indeed we did a nice one 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:30.749
 party with a very strong version that is 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.909
 unfortunately we lost it, however, the game 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:34.169
 in football he sometimes wins once you lose 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.599
 once paris 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.599
 this takes nothing away from us 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:42.479
 sylvan station and takes nothing away from the 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.479
 fact that we have tried anyway 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.459
 our continuity we found the 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.989
 trust in our means we have found 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.579
 a balance that allows us to 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:51.949
 face the game with Mariano in 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.360
 differently than an aricolo 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.009
 from the beginning of the year and it is also necessary 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.809
 to say that in any case our adversaries like 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.099
 with the juve regarding the 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.839
 our other sample we have in the 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.099
 also matches that we can 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.949
 quietly win if we play 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:12.599
 how we also played today and how 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:14.989
 vice lately it is safe but 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.989
 certainly 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.460
 this is not by chance where they are 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.050
 both in europe and in our league 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.190
 They have a very complete squad is adequate 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.990
 balanced with players who 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.430
 can change your game into a 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.380
 according to the other how it happened too 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.150
 today because in the end it's not like you 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.210
 have 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.830
 I created something special 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.660
 where to say hats off and so is 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.420
 It was an episode we lost 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.770
 ball a pa a vertical passage e 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.770
 good night unfortunately
