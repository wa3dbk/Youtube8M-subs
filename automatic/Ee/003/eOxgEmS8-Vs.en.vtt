00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
largest GP ever but it did so when you

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
make the argument you know should have

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
make the argument you know should have
drafted<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.299> foil<00:01:10.570> boy<00:01:10.899> so<00:01:11.350> he<00:01:11.530> passed<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.250> the

argument<00:01:13.900> isn't<00:01:14.409> really<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:14.979> it's<00:01:15.520> kind<00:01:15.820> of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
argument isn't really like it's kind of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.270 
argument isn't really like it's kind of
a<00:01:15.970> no-win<00:01:16.540> situation<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:17.650> he<00:01:17.770> shouldn't<00:01:18.070> be

a no-win situation and he shouldn't be

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
decision and secondly why is it there

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.560 
decision and secondly why is it there
even<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.890> possibility<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.940> card<00:01:40.270> worth

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
even the possibility of a card worth

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.010 
even the possibility of a card worth
that<00:01:40.869> much<00:01:41.049> money<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:43.060> would<00:01:43.299> affect<00:01:43.810> a

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
that much money that it would affect a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.330 
that much money that it would affect a
draft<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:44.770> isn't<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:46.930> eight<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.470> the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
draft this isn't that a top eight of the

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.320 
draft this isn't that a top eight of the
largest<00:01:48.670> GP<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.430> consider<00:01:51.790> all<00:01:51.939> these

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
largest GP when you consider all these

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.719 
largest GP when you consider all these
different<00:01:52.630> components<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:53.619> think<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.369> answer

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
different components I think the answer

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.990 
different components I think the answer
is<00:01:54.790> modern<00:01:55.600> cards<00:01:55.990> foil<00:01:56.710> cards<00:01:57.250> non<00:01:57.490> foil<00:01:57.820> or

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
is modern cards foil cards non foil or

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.039 
is modern cards foil cards non foil or
still<00:01:58.780> too<00:01:59.380> expensive<00:02:00.420> before<00:02:01.420> Tommy<00:02:01.720> Boy<00:02:01.960> if

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
still too expensive before Tommy Boy if

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.649 
still too expensive before Tommy Boy if
I<00:02:02.140> feels<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.970> three<00:02:03.970> hundred<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.360> fifty

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
I feels like three hundred and fifty

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.260 
I feels like three hundred and fifty
dollars<00:02:04.960> right<00:02:05.140> now<00:02:05.759> maybe<00:02:06.759> three<00:02:06.970> hundred

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
dollars right now maybe three hundred

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.749 
dollars right now maybe three hundred
dollars<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.840> 80<00:02:08.019> something<00:02:08.649> expensive<00:02:09.340> and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
dollars to 80 something expensive and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.070 
dollars to 80 something expensive and
that's<00:02:10.659> crazy<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.709> me<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.909> card<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.689> stowed

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
that's crazy to me that a card is stowed

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.839 
that's crazy to me that a card is stowed
that<00:02:14.349> expensive<00:02:14.860> even<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.459> foil<00:02:17.129> but<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.760> know

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
that expensive even in foil but you know

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.699 
that expensive even in foil but you know
a<00:02:18.879> topic<00:02:19.419> or<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.719> mean<00:02:19.840> when<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> comic<00:02:20.469> what<00:02:20.590> when

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
a topic or I mean when a comic what when

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.490 
a topic or I mean when a comic what when
you're<00:02:20.829> drafting<00:02:21.310> mod<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.730> master
