down okay so can I get used to that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.819 
down okay so can I get used to that
motion<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.619> there

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
motion first all right now from there

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
motion first all right now from there
but<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> guys<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.200> same

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
exact motion but instead of being it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
exact motion but instead of being it
slow<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.409> quicker<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
slow make it a little bit quicker and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.330 
slow make it a little bit quicker and
smaller<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.030> from<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.450> basically<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:08.009> thumbs

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
smaller so from here basically my thumbs

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.030 
smaller so from here basically my thumbs
are<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.570> okay<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.890> we're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.380 
try this motion right here by like this
so<00:02:44.800> thumbs<00:02:45.130> start<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> legal<00:02:46.209> side

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
so thumbs start up in the legal side

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.380 
so thumbs start up in the legal side
upside<00:02:46.890> upside<00:02:47.890> upside<00:02:48.459> upside<00:02:48.910> because<00:02:49.239> a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
lot of this creates that kind of flutter

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.870 
lot of this creates that kind of flutter
like<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.709> then<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.519> it
