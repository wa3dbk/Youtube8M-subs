00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 and we want to believe 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.429
 there is a great imitator of a note that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.809
 let's see now in Carlos peace that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.809
 imitates pedro alfonso 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.050
 benjamin amadeo that you can analyze it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.730
 later to benjamin amadeo like peter 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.510
 alfonso 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.510
 look 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.310
 when the previous ghost hunter very 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.110
 happy with this wonderful trio that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.090
 come in with a lot of chemistry 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.930
 I am a friend and I know him a long time ago and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 benja joined you very well what 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 they know more than us out there but it 's 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.440
 a great big limited imitator that has 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 want to imitate I do not know here is that now 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 I wait and it's a quarter past three or 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.600
 except this one is very happy if they are going to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600
 15 minutes to go 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.130
 does not answer but does not 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.350
 had that was the evil because he did not 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.940
 like to be asked for invitations to see 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 I imagine in early January and the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.780
 competition of x plus first signed 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 second who leads us 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.950
 it's the first time my debut I hope not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.570
 it hurts they have more experiences and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.490
 said the authoritative word the debutante 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.050
 of you who told you that you 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.060
 they advanced the sale of what is going to 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.040
 find now we are enjoying 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.740
 now we are very much involved in 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.500
 rehearsals we already have the finished product 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.540
 we lack people but but the truth 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.510
 that after the first days of 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.730
 December since we debuted and have 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.620
 January there you start to see how you're going 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.330
 but now that they are calm 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.619
 we tell you that it is a good work you what 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.440
 is going to tell everyone in their own 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.420
 you work whatever they deem is 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.090
 you are going to see I am convinced that you are going 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.320
 to be a good criticism of yours the one 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.800
 that of the public 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 Peter where yes no 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.530
 2 medium very well for the boys to 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 freddy pedro and for benja which is a great 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.390
 imitator is also very good 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.760
 I already had it obviously on your face 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 It sounds loved and also a revelation 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.330
 because he has never shown himself as 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.670
 guest has shown himself as an actor like that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.890
 that we started by unwittingly returning a 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.170
 day in the other study performed by 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.420
 first time to maradona and how we knew 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.670
 in the privacy that I did not know 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.360
 thomas and gustavo yankelevich people who 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.070
 he knows them he imitated and then we ask him 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.780
 to someone who told us that we did not 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.780
 ask me for maradona 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.020
 and then they started inviting everyone in 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.550
 Your participation in your face sounds 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.550
 it never exploded that
