watt<00:00:39.550> overdrive<00:00:39.940> added<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.690> tube<00:00:41.590> rectifier

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
watt overdrive added a tube rectifier

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.960 
watt overdrive added a tube rectifier
and<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:43.120> affects<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.570> by<00:00:44.170> popular<00:00:44.560> demand<00:00:44.970> so

and it affects the by popular demand so
the<00:00:46.330> tube<00:00:46.630> rectifier<00:00:46.990> really<00:00:47.290> changes<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
the tube rectifier really changes the

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.220 
the tube rectifier really changes the
tonality<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:49.120> response<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.840> everything<00:00:49.990> that

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
tonality the response to everything that

path and then and he was insisting upon
a<00:01:23.950> tube<00:01:24.159> rectifiers<00:01:24.370> so<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:24.909> thought<00:01:25.590> okay<00:01:26.590> guy

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
a tube rectifiers so I thought okay guy

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.410 
a tube rectifiers so I thought okay guy
knows<00:01:27.220> what<00:01:27.370> he's<00:01:27.460> talking<00:01:27.730> about<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.180> you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
look very good for hammer-ons and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.700 
look very good for hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.560> smooth<00:01:32.920> kind<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.340> style<00:01:34.000> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
pull-offs that smooth kind of style and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.780 
pull-offs that smooth kind of style and
I'm<00:01:35.710> loving<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.100> way<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.250> feels<00:01:36.340> it's<00:01:36.610> pretty

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
I'm loving the way it feels it's pretty

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.460 
I'm loving the way it feels it's pretty
good<00:01:36.970> this<00:01:37.690> little<00:01:37.900> guy<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.320> it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
good this little guy I have on it

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.370 
good this little guy I have on it
feature<00:01:39.370> what<00:01:39.610> well<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.600> well<00:01:41.290> we're

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
feature what well this well we're

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.440 
feature what well this well we're
drivers<00:01:41.650> foot<00:01:41.800> switchable<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:44.400> that's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
drivers foot switchable and that's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.930 
drivers foot switchable and that's
essentially<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:50.400> without<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.670> it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
essentially it it's without that it's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.480 
essentially it it's without that it's
basically<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:53.290> standard<00:01:53.400> amplifier<00:01:54.400> in

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
basically your standard amplifier in

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.520 
basically your standard amplifier in
fact<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.760> can<00:01:54.909> with<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.020> way<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.350> now

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
fact you can with the way it is now

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.740 
fact you can with the way it is now
without<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.890> overdrive<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.360> crank<00:01:58.630> up

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
without the overdrive you can crank up

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.000 
without the overdrive you can crank up
the<00:01:58.900> preamp<00:01:59.260> gain

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
the preamp gain

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
the preamp gain
you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.290 

you<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.349> back<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.650> off<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.300> clean

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
you can back this off and you can clean

00:02:24.300 --> 00:03:38.260 
you can back this off and you can clean
that<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.629> little<00:02:24.720> bit<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.500> then

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.780 

you<00:03:44.530> remind<00:03:45.530> us<00:03:45.620> how<00:03:45.740> many<00:03:45.890> watts<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.580> thing

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
you remind us how many watts this thing

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.260 
you remind us how many watts this thing
is<00:03:46.940> 17<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.530> that's<00:03:48.680> pretty<00:03:48.860> crazy<00:03:49.070> what<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:50.000> now

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
is 17 so that's pretty crazy what it now

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.600 
is 17 so that's pretty crazy what it now
is<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.780> standard<00:03:51.110> cabinet<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:52.040> these

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
is this a standard cabinet for these

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.810 
is this a standard cabinet for these
heads<00:03:52.880> yeah<00:03:53.690> but<00:03:54.350> this<00:03:54.650> one<00:03:54.830> has<00:03:54.950> an<00:03:55.040> EVM<00:03:55.370> 12l

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
heads yeah but this one has an EVM 12l

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.810 
heads yeah but this one has an EVM 12l
in<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.030> that's<00:03:56.210> not<00:03:56.420> standard<00:03:57.640> what<00:03:58.640> would<00:03:58.760> you

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
in it that's not standard what would you

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.330 
in it that's not standard what would you
put<00:03:58.940> in<00:03:59.060> ordinarily<00:03:59.620> well<00:04:00.620> whatever<00:04:01.010> anybody

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
put in ordinarily well whatever anybody

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.820 
put in ordinarily well whatever anybody
wants<00:04:01.520> I<00:04:02.030> kind<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.510> liked<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.350> Celestion
