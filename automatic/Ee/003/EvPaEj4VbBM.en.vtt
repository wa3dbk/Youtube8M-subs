00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 we just entered the building where 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.990
 It is the restaurant we will go is 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.719
 a Spanish restaurant and it's called 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 will probably normally have a little 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.300
 in a hurry and grant that we eat fast and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.940
 pay as soon as possible as it should be 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.260
 call like that if you do not explain all this 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.600
 people we just found now from 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.190
 suddenly something must come out of something 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.190
 they have done here next 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.230
 this is one of the cool things about 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.640
 Japan the contrast is such that every time 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 that you take a step you find something 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.710
 completely different that can equally 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:55.079
 be a skyscraper that can be the same 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.079
 a temple that goes up with more designs 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.610
 says that just finding the site is 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.329
 over here says I wanted to stay 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.329
 here to see this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.429
 come, come, have you touched 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.819
 against the restaurant I think there's no 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:16.850
 no one inside how expensive I kill her and 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:20.350
 In addition they go in and smacks me 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.350
 paella mess ajillo 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 tapas 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.270
 and it is already 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.080
 today we are going to try to see how is this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.479
 so let's see what silver 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.200
 recommended there are here we have the feet 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.200
 It's all Japanese 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 carpaccio 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.700
 did 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.920
 so who guess what is 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:25.130
 and more water would be governed why he chose 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.450
 the hands well all written that the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.300
 environmentally different policy 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.350
 citizen gala with the camera we have 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.890
 order and Spanish omelette we have had 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.940
 flamingo strawberry eggs with lawyer a 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 the seafood and we asked for garlic 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.970
 so called garlic with prawns and tomÃ¡s but 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.500
 also Spanish tortilla this what 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.020
 they have asked 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.770
 now we will see that they bring us here we have 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.930
 the first dish that they brought us is the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.470
 new flamenco this looks good 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.010
 but look at this detail 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 zinc so it does not go that small and it's 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.230
 burning this is the lid a lid 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.190
 we're going to be hungry this is worth 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.430
 700 yen that is the change 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.430
 five euros 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.080
 and this is the Spanish village who have 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.940
 brought that they do look like 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.069
 Spanish tortilla but in the center 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.110
 has this that I do not know what is also 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.000
 It looks good but it sins the same 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.400
 problem and is that this behind like that 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 big 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.890
 and now comes for him Serranillo 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.250
 this are two small slices 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.349
 also two so small but that goes 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.120
 to go very well to eat it with the egg 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:54.870
 flamengo with the flamenco egg and 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 finally the prawns 4 prawns as already 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.549
 you can guess is a very dish 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.269
 small meanwhile here we have to 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.459
 coat 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.920

 a cannon a plate that my mother does 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.750
 daily fish good the portions are 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.479
 small but in the end I think we 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.830

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.970
