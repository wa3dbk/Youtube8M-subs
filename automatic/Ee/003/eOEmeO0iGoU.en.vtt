all know this map has an incredibly

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.210 
all know this map has an incredibly
short<00:00:28.109> walking<00:00:28.410> distance<00:00:28.619> right<00:00:29.189> here

short walking distance right here
between<00:00:29.910> these<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.510> bases<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.920> i<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.189> expect

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
between these two bases so i do expect

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290 
between these two bases so i do expect
to<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.950> i'm<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.399> disappointed<00:00:35.760> if

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

to see i'm going to be disappointed if
there's<00:00:36.510> no<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.020> Ling's<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.989> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
there's no all in Ling's here so that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's no all in Ling's here so that
should<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> case<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> today<00:00:41.520> that's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
have i drew the macro machine so if he

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.819 
have i drew the macro machine so if he
does<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.440> decide<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.989> pop<00:00:51.989> 10<00:00:52.530> hatch

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
does you know decide to pop 10 hatch

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.430 
does you know decide to pop 10 hatch
mass<00:00:53.219> Hydra<00:00:53.850> i<00:00:54.059> guess<00:00:54.510> i<00:00:54.690> won't<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> surprised

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
mass Hydra i guess i won't be surprised

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
mass Hydra i guess i won't be surprised
but<00:00:56.449> personally<00:00:57.449> i'm<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:58.050> say<00:00:58.940> some<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.090> in

just<00:02:09.599> gonna<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.580> hole<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.790> ling

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
just gonna go for that hole in ling

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.390 
just gonna go for that hole in ling
but<00:02:13.600> oh<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.020> he's<00:02:14.110> got<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> banelings<00:02:15.130> nest

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
but oh and he's got a banelings nest

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400 
but oh and he's got a banelings nest
actually<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.480> he's<00:02:16.630> not<00:02:16.870> going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.170> getting

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410

actually so he's not going to be getting
this<00:02:17.740> metabolic<00:02:18.130> boost<00:02:18.520> right<00:02:18.790> away<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.330> was

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
this metabolic boost right away I was

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.390 
this metabolic boost right away I was

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
spine crawler goes down and now these

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.570 
spine crawler goes down and now these
queens<00:05:47.649> are<00:05:47.740> going<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:47.949> be<00:05:48.039> able<00:05:48.129> to<00:05:48.310> hold<00:05:48.430> out

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
queens are going to be able to hold out

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.820 
queens are going to be able to hold out
these<00:05:48.789> earthlings<00:05:49.210> but<00:05:49.810> if<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.199> drew<00:05:50.259> can<00:05:50.620> push

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
these earthlings but if I drew can push

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.329 
these earthlings but if I drew can push
in<00:05:51.009> with<00:05:51.189> a<00:05:51.219> lot<00:05:51.490> more<00:05:51.520> units<00:05:52.089> he<00:05:53.159> might<00:05:54.159> be

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
in with a lot more units he might be

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.089 
in with a lot more units he might be
able<00:05:54.430> to<00:05:54.639> take<00:05:54.879> this<00:05:55.060> game<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.740> really<00:05:56.740> think<00:05:56.919> he

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
able to take this game I really think he

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.649 
able to take this game I really think he
should<00:05:57.430> have<00:05:57.550> went<00:05:57.729> for<00:05:57.879> these<00:05:58.000> drones<00:05:58.389> here

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
should have went for these drones here

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.439 
should have went for these drones here
and<00:05:58.839> have<00:05:59.289> sent<00:05:59.529> us<00:05:59.680> at<00:05:59.800> third<00:06:00.069> Queen<00:06:00.550> Hydra

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
links on Hydra just missed those

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.329 
links on Hydra just missed those
banelings<00:06:12.939> it<00:06:13.569> does<00:06:13.960> waste<00:06:14.439> those<00:06:14.770> on<00:06:14.979> a<00:06:15.009> spine

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:15.339 
banelings it does waste those on a spine

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.360 
banelings it does waste those on a spine
crawler<00:06:15.610> I<00:06:15.879> sure<00:06:16.509> had<00:06:16.899> the<00:06:17.139> advantage<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.949> he

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
crawler I sure had the advantage and he

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.279 
crawler I sure had the advantage and he
just<00:06:18.610> doesn't<00:06:19.029> look<00:06:19.689> like<00:06:19.839> he's<00:06:19.990> capitalizing

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
just doesn't look like he's capitalizing

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.980
