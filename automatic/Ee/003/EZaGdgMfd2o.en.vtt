more kills with this I think this and
the<00:00:19.350> Sega<00:00:19.590> 12-gauge<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.580> USS<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the Sega 12-gauge and the USS are the

the Sega 12-gauge and the USS are the
only<00:00:22.109> ones<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.740> left<00:00:23.029> but<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.240> zero

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
kills that they use fast so I don't know

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.910 
kills that they use fast so I don't know
if<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> bloom<00:00:27.480> --is--<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.869> zero<00:00:28.529> kills

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
if I want to bloom --is-- my zero kills

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.620 
if I want to bloom --is-- my zero kills
on<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.460> battle<00:00:30.289> my<00:00:31.289> battle<00:00:32.070> log<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.510> know

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
on my battle my battle log and you know

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
on my battle my battle log and you know
get<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> service<00:00:34.380> star<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
get the service star with it what do you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
get the service star with it what do you
guys<00:00:35.160> think<00:00:35.219> should<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> service<00:00:36.149> star

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.110 
or should I just leave it as zero kills
I<00:00:38.010> think<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.309> kind<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> funny<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.000> have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I think it's kind of funny that I have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
I think it's kind of funny that I have
zero<00:00:39.360> kills<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.079> yeah<00:00:40.829> what's<00:00:41.070> going

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
zero kills with it but yeah what's going

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
zero kills with it but yeah what's going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.190 
mechanics that go behind making a bullet
are<00:01:10.409> very<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.860> interesting<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.490> mean

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
basically I started at the factory as a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
basically I started at the factory as a
normal<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.420> grunt<00:01:15.869> worker<00:01:16.049> working<00:01:16.409> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
normal you know grunt worker working in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620 
normal you know grunt worker working in
packaging<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> packaging<00:01:18.030> doesn't<00:01:18.390> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
packaging and packaging doesn't really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
packaging and packaging doesn't really
mean<00:01:18.869> me<00:01:19.080> putting<00:01:19.439> bullets<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> casing<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
mean me putting bullets and casing and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
mean me putting bullets and casing and
mean<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> does<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.000> certain<00:01:21.299> rounds<00:01:21.750> certain

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
mean it does for certain rounds certain

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
mean it does for certain rounds certain
rounds<00:01:22.350> were<00:01:22.470> already<00:01:22.830> pre<00:01:23.070> pre<00:01:23.939> assembled

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
rounds were already pre pre assembled

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.760 
rounds were already pre pre assembled
but<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.780> rounds<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> would<00:01:25.290> actually<00:01:25.439> sit

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but some rounds you would actually sit

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.780 
going to be dangerous for that soldier
if<00:02:59.140> he's<00:02:59.379> you<00:02:59.709> know<00:02:59.799> out<00:02:59.980> in<00:03:00.159> a<00:03:00.370> wet

I had to have we had to had really high

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.210 
I had to have we had to had really high
standards<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:06.940> terms<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.359> that<00:03:07.510> now<00:03:08.220> me

personally<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:10.390> didn't<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.079> wasn't<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.730> hard

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
personally I didn't I wasn't a hard

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.899 
personally I didn't I wasn't a hard
grader<00:03:14.109> I<00:03:14.260> guess<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.769> was<00:03:14.920> very<00:03:15.190> lenient<00:03:15.579> on

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
grader I guess I was very lenient on

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.240 
grader I guess I was very lenient on
letting<00:03:16.239> my<00:03:16.390> people<00:03:17.290> make<00:03:17.799> sure<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.130> they

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
letting my people make sure that they

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.710 
letting my people make sure that they
fix<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.639> errors<00:03:18.970> because<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.239> was<00:03:19.359> important

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
fix the errors because it was important

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.289 
fix the errors because it was important
to<00:03:19.810> me<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.919> ammunition<00:03:21.430> was<00:03:21.790> quality<00:03:22.209> at

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
to me that the ammunition was quality at

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.569 
to me that the ammunition was quality at
the<00:03:22.419> same<00:03:22.599> time<00:03:22.870> as<00:03:23.109> you<00:03:23.319> know<00:03:23.470> doing<00:03:24.220> my<00:03:24.340> job

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
the same time as you know doing my job

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.559 
the same time as you know doing my job
and<00:03:24.940> making<00:03:25.660> sure<00:03:25.780> people<00:03:26.109> were<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:28.450> know

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
and making sure people were you know

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.479 
and making sure people were you know
they<00:03:28.780> were<00:03:28.810> reasonable<00:03:29.650> because<00:03:29.829> making

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
they were reasonable because making

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.099 
they were reasonable because making
ammunition<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.090> very<00:03:31.299> tricky<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.810> mean<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
ammunition is very tricky I mean the

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.080 
ammunition is very tricky I mean the
machine<00:03:32.260> goes<00:03:32.590> wrong<00:03:32.859> next<00:03:33.790> thing<00:03:33.879> you<00:03:33.970> know

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
machine goes wrong next thing you know

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.759 
machine goes wrong next thing you know
you've<00:03:34.239> got<00:03:34.359> a<00:03:34.389> defect<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.139> you<00:03:35.379> know<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
you've got a defect and you know a

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.470 
you've got a defect and you know a
hundred<00:03:36.010> thousand<00:03:36.489> rounds<00:03:36.609> are<00:03:36.879> just<00:03:37.090> ruined

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
hundred thousand rounds are just ruined

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.970 
hundred thousand rounds are just ruined
and<00:03:37.629> that's<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.840> lot<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.109> ammunition<00:03:38.470> that's<00:03:38.889> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and that's a lot of ammunition that's a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.280 
and that's a lot of ammunition that's a
lot<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.220> money<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.669> waste<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:41.019> was<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.200> very

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
lot of money to waste so it was a very

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.069 
lot of money to waste so it was a very
stressful<00:03:41.919> job<00:03:42.129> at<00:03:42.489> times<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:42.970> mean<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.959> was

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
stressful job at times I mean it was

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.050 
stressful job at times I mean it was
easy<00:03:44.260> though<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.889> had<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.160> make<00:03:45.310> sure<00:03:45.519> you

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
easy though and I had to make sure you

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.550 
easy though and I had to make sure you
know<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.209> did<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.540> sorts<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.079> stuff<00:03:47.290> there<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
know I did all sorts of stuff there I

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.900 
know I did all sorts of stuff there I
made<00:03:47.859> sure<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.340> like<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.549> said<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
made sure that you like I said the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.460 
made sure that you like I said the
bullets<00:03:49.209> were<00:03:49.329> waterproof<00:03:49.840> which<00:03:50.049> means<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
bullets were waterproof which means you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.619 
bullets were waterproof which means you
basically<00:03:50.799> take<00:03:51.069> ten<00:03:51.340> bullets<00:03:51.699> you<00:03:52.269> dip<00:03:52.480> them

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
basically take ten bullets you dip them

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.330 
basically take ten bullets you dip them
in<00:03:52.780> water<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.319> look<00:03:53.500> for<00:03:53.709> bubbles<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.220> if

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
in water and you look for bubbles and if

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.949 
in water and you look for bubbles and if
they<00:03:54.459> don't<00:03:54.669> pass<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.150> bubble<00:03:55.510> test<00:03:55.690> you'll

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
they don't pass the bubble test you'll

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.740 
they don't pass the bubble test you'll
have<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.829> can't<00:03:57.099> pass<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:58.209> can't

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
have to you can't pass that you can't

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.619 
have to you can't pass that you can't
let<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.079> logo<00:03:59.620> out<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.790> really

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
let that logo out and I really

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.970 
let that logo out and I really
understood<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.049> more<00:04:02.379> so<00:04:02.560> than<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> lot<00:04:02.829> of

people I worked with because a lot of

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.150 
people I worked with because a lot of
people<00:04:04.480> don't<00:04:04.690> realize<00:04:04.989> how<00:04:05.379> dangerous<00:04:05.650> can

powder<00:05:48.880> flash<00:05:49.300> but<00:05:49.720> for<00:05:50.290> the<00:05:50.350> most<00:05:50.500> part<00:05:50.590> it's

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
powder flash but for the most part it's

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.010 
powder flash but for the most part it's
not<00:05:51.400> dangerous<00:05:51.670> unless<00:05:52.090> it's<00:05:52.360> chambered<00:05:52.750> so

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
not dangerous unless it's chambered so

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.470 
not dangerous unless it's chambered so
it<00:05:53.950> scared<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.430> crap<00:05:54.670> out<00:05:54.910> of<00:05:54.940> me

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
it scared the crap out of me

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.090 
it scared the crap out of me
the<00:05:55.780> girl<00:05:55.990> had<00:05:56.110> to<00:05:56.230> go<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.380> medical<00:05:56.800> cliff<00:05:56.980> she

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
the girl had to go to medical cliff she

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.040 
the girl had to go to medical cliff she
had<00:05:57.250> some<00:05:57.490> gunpowder<00:05:57.910> burns<00:05:58.150> on<00:05:58.390> her<00:05:58.510> legs<00:05:58.540> but

had some gunpowder burns on her legs but

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.380 
had some gunpowder burns on her legs but
needless<00:06:00.040> to<00:06:00.280> say<00:06:00.310> I<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.610> tried<00:06:01.060> it<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.210> little

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
needless to say I I tried it a little

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.150 
needless to say I I tried it a little
bit<00:06:01.570> more<00:06:01.750> lightly<00:06:02.110> at<00:06:02.470> that<00:06:02.680> point<00:06:02.980> because

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
bit more lightly at that point because

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.610 
bit more lightly at that point because
you<00:06:03.490> know<00:06:03.550> I<00:06:03.640> before<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.390> I<00:06:04.540> it<00:06:04.780> was<00:06:05.050> like<00:06:05.170> oh<00:06:05.290> man

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
won't that'll never happen in a million

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.070 
won't that'll never happen in a million
years<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:09.370> then<00:06:09.850> within<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.450> course<00:06:10.750> of<00:06:10.930> like

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
years and then within the course of like

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.020 
years and then within the course of like
three<00:06:11.410> days<00:06:11.590> I<00:06:11.800> heard<00:06:11.980> like<00:06:12.160> five<00:06:12.490> rounds<00:06:12.880> go

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
three days I heard like five rounds go

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.390 
three days I heard like five rounds go
off<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.420> got<00:06:13.510> hit<00:06:13.660> by<00:06:13.810> one<00:06:13.840> of<00:06:14.080> them<00:06:14.320> so<00:06:14.530> there

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
off and got hit by one of them so there

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.950 
off and got hit by one of them so there
were<00:06:15.520> some<00:06:15.700> dangerous<00:06:16.120> parts<00:06:16.480> of<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.690> job<00:06:16.900> I

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
were some dangerous parts of the job I

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.420 
were some dangerous parts of the job I
mean<00:06:17.230> it<00:06:17.350> wasn't<00:06:17.500> like<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:17.830> could<00:06:17.860> get<00:06:18.160> killed

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
mean it wasn't like I could get killed

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.100 
mean it wasn't like I could get killed
or<00:06:18.550> anything<00:06:18.640> and<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.030> was<00:06:19.240> we<00:06:19.750> were<00:06:19.870> in<00:06:19.930> a

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
or anything and I was we were in a

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.690 
or anything and I was we were in a
couple<00:06:20.440> fires<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:20.890> know<00:06:20.920> fires<00:06:21.250> were<00:06:21.460> pretty

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
couple fires you know fires were pretty

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.400 
couple fires you know fires were pretty
common<00:06:22.090> because<00:06:22.270> gunpowder<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.170> very

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
common because gunpowder is a very

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.890 
common because gunpowder is a very
volatile<00:06:23.920> substance<00:06:24.550> but<00:06:24.790> you<00:06:25.570> know<00:06:25.660> they<00:06:25.780> had

volatile substance but you know they had
a<00:06:25.930> very<00:06:26.170> solid<00:06:26.530> system<00:06:26.950> to<00:06:27.220> put<00:06:27.400> those<00:06:27.550> out<00:06:27.760> so

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
a very solid system to put those out so

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.660 
a very solid system to put those out so
overall<00:06:28.750> my<00:06:28.870> experiences<00:06:29.650> making<00:06:29.920> ammo<00:06:30.370> was
