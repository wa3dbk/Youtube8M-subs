one of the cleanest cars I've ever seen

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.050 
one of the cleanest cars I've ever seen

ever been on the inside of it I've got a
burgundy<00:00:22.250> exterior<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.689> reason<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
burgundy exterior and the reason we

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
burgundy exterior and the reason we
bought<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.410> car<00:00:25.740> primarily<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.760> three

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
bought this car primarily for three

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.410 
bought this car primarily for three
reasons<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.800> 99<00:00:29.250> s<00:00:29.400> were<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> very<00:00:29.939> very

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
reasons one is the 99 s were a very very

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.670 
reasons one is the 99 s were a very very
reliable<00:00:31.019> rig<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> 2000s<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.500> that's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
reliable rig and in the 2000s so that's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
reliable rig and in the 2000s so that's
the<00:00:34.829> first<00:00:35.040> reason<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> second<00:00:35.790> reason<00:00:35.880> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the first reason the second reason is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.840 
the first reason the second reason is
it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> 7<00:00:36.690> passenger<00:00:37.040> which<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.579> seen

before that seems to be a fairly
uncommon<00:00:41.989> option<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:43.890> was

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
uncommon option and then the other was

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069
