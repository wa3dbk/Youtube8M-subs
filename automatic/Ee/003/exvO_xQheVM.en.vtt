00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
 first met on the place max and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 seat Schalke's youngest offspring 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.580
 hopes then in front of the micros 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:16.230
 more exciting than a game like this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.289
 interview can start is natural 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 we have been a very nervous though 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.439
 I think so too 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.080
 footballer and I think that now 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.699
 also get used to slowly get used 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.349
 the public must be ok too 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 meyer with her psion is not like that now 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.579
 rarely but what's her name right 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.110
 worked even ask your name again because 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.120
 There are so many different variants 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 height to be pronounced 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.500
 yes, of course, there are different ones 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.219
 Variations in German actually say 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.930
 Cola she is naked and in Boston is saying 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 you also cola chinas so there is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 different what yes what should then 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 use 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.350
 the german group is best cola 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.390
 sina right again what did that learn 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.550
 Keyword for the guys is learning whether 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 against drogba or in training 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.149
 Of course, very exciting, I think 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.799
 not now, of course, it is also now 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.820
 difference whether she is at the pressure 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.900
 or whether it is also in training me 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
 I think I can do a lot in training 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.260
 learn a lot from all the players though 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.420
 the kick-off difference is easy 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.340
 also the atmosphere so that player 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.119
 for that and that is then I think a lot 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.590
 big difference 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.270
 My highlight was I was the first 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.979
 play in mainz a bundesligaduell 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 area really excited where 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 Coach called me but at 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 first contact was then also 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
 path 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.520
 and the umpteenth contact was then the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.660
 template right there believes contact 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.080
 I know exactly but great afterwards 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.729
 first cheer with the big vote 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.830
 So before pretty quickly that I had 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.330
 Then I ran to the fans 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.890
 I celebrated with the others important 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.050
 is above all that there is something to celebrate 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.210
 gives in the training game on Wednesday 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.240
 the guys met each other directly 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.290
 19 year old seat the muscle package and the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.170
 17-year-old max filigree technician 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.770
 currently over half a year doing max 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.649
 continuous for a few months 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.119
 both still new in the world of professionals 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.050
 which contact person do you contact? 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.600
 by asking 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.979
 Do you go to his old man's house then ? 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.459
 the gentleman with zelda the man with the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.170
 Do you beard or go to Julian? 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.580
 I can help myself with so many 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 case though wet experienced player 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.020
 Real Madrid played and if I was something 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.670
 ask to ask if I'll go then 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.750
 of course, to more useful july can 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 I watch a lot 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.180
 but make tip for me at jule 's 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.890
 yes, someone whose little you like 40 times 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.780
 would pursue or in any case 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.910
 wants to have 2 endstand the on itself 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.530
 job and has done in time 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.200
 It's phenomenal with 19 years 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.580
 national player of course made great 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.769
 from him and of course hard 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.450
 imitate but I try all the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.040
 youngest need the balls and rods 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.290
 But we do that of course 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.790
 I like to have this development 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.650
 me this year actually on that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.840
 I actually a lot this year 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 But that will be the way to learn 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.980
 Of course, running is good for myself 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.560
 and I hope that this will continue 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.880
 the two a youth masters are on the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.769
 she has been in the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.750
 startelf and max against düsseldorf 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.410
 finally with his debut in the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.079
 arena hünerfeld fulfilling a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.480
 certainly always before 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.950
 this audience game in front of 60,000 arena 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.370
 and at the beginning I was pretty nervous 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.900
 because it was first half for me and 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.440
 the university also went after cech 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.070
 the 21st 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.530
 immediately autographs photos interviews the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.090
 normal madness as it goes on 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.239
 In the everyday life, the boys decide 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.769
 training and there falls on the youngest he 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.780
 not hiding in he converses 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.579
 want every ball and get one too 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.080
 amount because the others already know him 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.420
 can do something with it 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.920
 the motto show that's right 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.780
 of course I want to offer myself for the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.340
 trainer and my best in training 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.660
 I also give that on the weekend option 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.830
 lead on as it is now in the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.810
 It was clean for me last time 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.400
 brought my goal has therefore 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.600
 continue training to give everything 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.700
 The last two weeks have been for me 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.190
 very exciting and i just hope 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.690
 that it continues to rage so often that often 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.400
 whole schalke with them what is there 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.200
 more beautiful than if your own guys 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.660
 Breakthrough pack the future 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.660
