00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the cops that wasn't just a sole idea

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.280 
the cops that wasn't just a sole idea
that<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.860> thought<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:42.360> by<00:00:42.420> someone<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.170> guess

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that was thought of by someone I guess

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.860 
that was thought of by someone I guess
and<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.760> wasn't<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.149> an<00:00:45.300> idea<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> someone

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and it wasn't just an idea that someone

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
and it wasn't just an idea that someone
came<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> decided<00:00:47.100> okay<00:00:47.399> let's<00:00:47.430> make

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
came up with and decided okay let's make

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.920 
came up with and decided okay let's make
a<00:00:47.850> game<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.379> essentially<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.539> 1995<00:00:51.539> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
a game on this so essentially in 1995 a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740 
a game on this so essentially in 1995 a
game<00:00:52.710> went<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.070> development<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.940> DMA<00:00:54.539> design

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
game went into development by DMA design

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
game went into development by DMA design
which<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.530> later<00:00:55.620> become<00:00:55.890> Rockstar<00:00:56.550> north

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
which would later become Rockstar north

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.840 
which would later become Rockstar north
a<00:00:57.149> few<00:00:57.449> years<00:00:57.660> down<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> line<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.850> 1995

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a few years down the line but in 1995

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
a few years down the line but in 1995
this<00:01:00.090> game<00:01:00.329> went<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> development<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> was

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this game went to development in it was

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
this game went to development in it was
called<00:01:01.980> race<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.460> chase<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.390> whole<00:01:03.600> idea

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
called race and chase and the whole idea

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.679 
called race and chase and the whole idea
of<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.970> think<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:06.450> four

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of it was is I think there's like four

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
of it was is I think there's like four
different<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:07.200> modes<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:07.890> well<00:01:08.130> but

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
different game modes to it as well but

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
different game modes to it as well but
essentially<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> could<00:01:09.540> play<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> cop<00:01:10.140> or

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
essentially you could play as a cop or

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.780 
essentially you could play as a cop or
you<00:01:10.500> could<00:01:10.650> play<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> criminal<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.580> there

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you could play as a criminal and there

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
you could play as a criminal and there
were<00:01:11.850> different<00:01:12.150> game<00:01:12.270> modes<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> said

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
were different game modes like I said

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
were different game modes like I said
there<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.170> Cannonball<00:01:13.770> Run<00:01:14.150> demolition

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
there was Cannonball Run demolition

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
there was Cannonball Run demolition
derby<00:01:15.540> bank<00:01:15.869> robbery<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> robber<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.189> bank

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
derby bank robbery is a robber and bank

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
derby bank robbery is a robber and bank
robbery<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> cop<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> essentially<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
robbery is a cop and essentially you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
robbery is a cop and essentially you
could<00:01:19.979> play<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> cops<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
could play as is just like a cops and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
could play as is just like a cops and
crooks<00:01:22.619> type<00:01:22.920> deal<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.180> either<00:01:24.330> play

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

crooks type deal and you can either play
as<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> cop<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.470> play<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> robber

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
as a cop or you could play as a robber

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
as a cop or you could play as a robber
and<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.540> were<00:01:27.750> multiple<00:01:27.960> cities<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and there were multiple cities I think

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800 
and there were multiple cities I think
New<00:01:29.220> York<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.670> Miami<00:01:30.090> were<00:01:30.210> mentioned<00:01:30.659> which

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
New York and Miami were mentioned which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
New York and Miami were mentioned which
it's<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> funny<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:31.799> later<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> down

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's kind of funny because later on down

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
it's kind of funny because later on down

and<00:01:48.240> 2<00:01:48.329> did<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> course<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> your

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and 2 did of course and up here on your

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
and 2 did of course and up here on your
screen<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> believe<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
screen actually I believe this is the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
screen actually I believe this is the
only<00:01:52.890> known<00:01:53.159> screenshot<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.240> race<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> chase

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
only known screenshot for race and chase

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.319 
only known screenshot for race and chase
and<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.399> screen<00:01:56.670> shot<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.149> while

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and this is the screen shot up but while

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
and this is the screen shot up but while
it<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.600> still<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.869> development<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.649> course

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it was still in development of course

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.459 
it was still in development of course
but<00:01:59.310> during<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> development<00:02:00.689> process<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but during the development process of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
but during the development process of
this<00:02:01.710> game<00:02:01.950> which<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.280> course<00:02:02.310> started<00:02:02.880> in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this game which of course started in

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.709 
this game which of course started in
1995<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.259> scheduled<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.250> July<00:02:05.719> 1996

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
1995 it was scheduled in in July 1996

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
1995 it was scheduled in in July 1996
and<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.069> supposed<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> take

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and I think it was supposed to take

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.059 
and I think it was supposed to take
around<00:02:08.879> 18<00:02:09.360> months<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:09.989> during<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.470> time<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
around 18 months but during this time a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
around 18 months but during this time a
glitch<00:02:11.819> happened

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
glitch happened

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.850 
glitch happened
and<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.470> glitch<00:02:13.710> basically<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.020> was<00:02:16.050> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and the glitch basically what it was is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.270 
and the glitch basically what it was is
the<00:02:17.430> ai-controlled<00:02:17.910> police<00:02:18.630> cars<00:02:18.960> would<00:02:19.890> RAM

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the ai-controlled police cars would RAM

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.730 
the ai-controlled police cars would RAM
the<00:02:20.820> player-controlled<00:02:21.450> vehicle<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
the player-controlled vehicle off the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.230 
the player-controlled vehicle off the
road<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.160> player<00:02:23.400> controlled<00:02:23.820> vehicle

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
road and the player controlled vehicle

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.540 
road and the player controlled vehicle
would<00:02:24.390> either<00:02:24.570> be<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.140> police<00:02:26.040> car<00:02:26.310> if<00:02:26.400> you're

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
would either be a police car if you're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.430 
would either be a police car if you're
playing<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> cop<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.570> course<00:02:27.840> or<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> robber

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
playing as a cop of course or a robber

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
playing as a cop of course or a robber
and<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.220> developers<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.360> game<00:02:30.570> they

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and the developers of this game they

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.850 
and the developers of this game they
thought<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.170> funny<00:02:31.350> because<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.740> was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
thought it was funny because it was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.130 
thought it was funny because it was
non-stop<00:02:32.160> crashing<00:02:32.970> these<00:02:33.150> these<00:02:33.810> police

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
non-stop crashing these these police

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.750 
non-stop crashing these these police
cars<00:02:34.170> would<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.650> ram<00:02:35.070> into<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.670> there

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
cars would just ram into you and there

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.910 
cars would just ram into you and there
was<00:02:35.880> no<00:02:36.060> getting<00:02:36.240> away<00:02:36.480> from<00:02:36.630> him<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.770> was

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
was no getting away from him and it was

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.010 
was no getting away from him and it was
just<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> simple<00:02:38.340> bug<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.910> glitch<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.810> game

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
just a simple bug in glitch in the game

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.830 
just a simple bug in glitch in the game
in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> coding<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.860> whatnot<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.060> these

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
in the coding and whatnot and these

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.960 
in the coding and whatnot and these
developers<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.560> these<00:02:43.709> testers<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.760> game

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
developers in these testers of this game

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
developers in these testers of this game
they<00:02:45.300> thought<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.810> whole<00:02:46.050> idea<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.680> concept

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
they thought this whole idea in concept

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.790 
they thought this whole idea in concept
was<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:47.370> funny<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> they<00:02:48.959> abandoned<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
was really funny and they abandoned the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.180 
was really funny and they abandoned the
linear<00:02:50.130> missions<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.600> race<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.530> chase<00:02:52.830> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
linear missions of race and chase and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
linear missions of race and chase and
they<00:02:54.000> changed<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.870> where<00:02:55.020> instead<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
they changed it up to where instead of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.199 
they changed it up to where instead of
being<00:02:55.709> able<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.920> play<00:02:56.100> as<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> cop<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.850> robber

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
being able to play as a cop or a robber

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.800 
being able to play as a cop or a robber
you<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:58.440> play<00:02:58.709> as<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.430> robbery<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.480> what<00:03:00.630> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
you just play as a robbery and what that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.020 
you just play as a robbery and what that
said<00:03:01.170> that's<00:03:01.890> how<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.190> whole<00:03:02.310> idea<00:03:02.430> and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
said that's how the whole idea and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.180 
said that's how the whole idea and
concept<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.989> grand<00:03:04.290> theft<00:03:04.440> auto<00:03:04.620> came<00:03:05.010> into

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
concept of grand theft auto came into

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.820 
concept of grand theft auto came into
play<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.730> took<00:03:06.000> over<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.690> 30<00:03:07.080> months<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
play it took over like 30 months to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.190 
play it took over like 30 months to
develop<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:09.120> game<00:03:09.360> because<00:03:09.750> once<00:03:09.989> they

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
develop this game because once they

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.050 
develop this game because once they
stopped<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.620> whole<00:03:10.770> idea<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.160> race<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.820> chase

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
stopped the whole idea of race and chase

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.560 
stopped the whole idea of race and chase
in<00:03:12.440> between<00:03:13.440> 1995<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.190> 1996<00:03:15.030> they<00:03:15.239> scrapped

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
in between 1995 and 1996 they scrapped

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.910 
in between 1995 and 1996 they scrapped
that<00:03:15.660> idea<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.290> they<00:03:16.350> come<00:03:16.590> up<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:16.739> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
that idea and they come up with a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.250 
that idea and they come up with a
concept<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.700> grand<00:03:18.420> theft<00:03:18.600> auto<00:03:18.870> an

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
concept of grand theft auto an

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.470 
concept of grand theft auto an
open-world<00:03:19.769> game<00:03:20.190> where<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.060> play<00:03:21.209> as<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
open-world game where you play as a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.870 
open-world game where you play as a
robber<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.019> do<00:03:22.290> stories<00:03:22.799> or<00:03:23.100> missions<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
robber you do stories or missions and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.190 
robber you do stories or missions and
you<00:03:24.000> try<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.360> away<00:03:24.450> from<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.750> police<00:03:24.900> etc

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
you try to get away from the police etc

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.380 
you try to get away from the police etc
it<00:03:25.950> still<00:03:26.370> had<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.610> top-down<00:03:26.850> view<00:03:27.239> in

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
it still had that top-down view in

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.720 
it still had that top-down view in
perspective<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.709> whole<00:03:28.890> idea<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.340> course

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
perspective but the whole idea of course

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.610 
perspective but the whole idea of course
like<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.970> said<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> racing<00:03:30.870> chase<00:03:31.080> was<00:03:31.380> just

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
like I said now a racing chase was just
