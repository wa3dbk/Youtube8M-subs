00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.730
 June 13, 2013 we are here now 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.760
 putting the but from the workshop to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.460
 tractor by square and what happened to us that 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.150
 the piece that we had lost that was 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.310
 similar to these 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.779
 we did not find her in the move and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.090
 then I had asked for the piece 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.189
 they brought this first and they did not bring me 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.470
 the auxiliary already with those two I already put it 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.649
 in the PTO of the Pascual 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.780
 has its stretch marks is the force taking the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.460
 Aquarius 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.950
 that's from there 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.329
 and we attach this piece 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.199
 this piece is embedded here 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.199
 for you to see 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 and then it fits with moon life 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 and we already have the attraction as strength 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.879
 universal of those four screws we 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.220
 we have to remove to put the piece and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.040
 then this reinforcement is put here 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 so much this reinforcement dismissed from here and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 it's fine we have it when cutting because 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.860
 but this piece would not enter 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.040
 on the four screws so that they take 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.650
 it's the work that we get out 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.720
 fix 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.590
 and we assembled the apero of euros to two and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.590
 for tomorrow Friday 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.150
 but desbrozador serrat in complication 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.760
 has the paschal and that turns on the contrary 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.590
 takes the paschal force and turn it 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.830
 opposite of professional tractors 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.620
 then we have already changed all the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.790
 hammers that have the steel we have 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.360
 changed direction we have turned them 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.820
 so that I cut to the against well 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.650
 and it is effective 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.280
 and then we have also bought some 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.100
 cardan 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.670
 that we have here what some teach 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.980
 cardan that in case of stopping the tractor 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.140
 in the inertia of the but not 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.670
 makes progress what problems we have 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.140
 before 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.690
 there we have lojana 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.170
 initial letters that in case the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.890
 tractor stop 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.040
 it was not moving but by inertia all the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.879
 vehicle is gained from safety 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.400
 I have a game for the opposite direction 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.130
 to the universal that is the pasqual and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.490
 another game for john deere 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.080
 but we still have here I have other 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.420
 games 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.640
 We do not have a breakdown because the system 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.720
 hydraulic does not work, let's see if 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.420
 so he lends us a hand and distributes it 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.130
 pending of the crane vehicles 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.959
 and three starters and we 've 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.980
 changed the vehicles and will give us 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.650
 time to see the joker 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.409
 without more a greeting with the great area of 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.260
 coordinator job presentation 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.629
 apascovi 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.440
 here the partner taking out the pieces in 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.710
 terms 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.700
 the for which 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.110
 today I had some reinforcements competing for 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.770
 attach the piece 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.770
 we have 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.460
 ready to place today for 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.960
 which and from which is to place it 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.960
 but desbrozador so that tomorrow 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.960
 let's work
