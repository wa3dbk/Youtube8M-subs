 modern and minimalist spaces like

 for classic rooms and inspiration 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.960
 baroque as demonstrated in the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600
 photographs that we present to you in this 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.329
 video the key is that the color that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.489
 predominate be the target and apply 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.619
 contrasts with different elements in 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.600
 yellow and black in this way 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.479
 we will favor the correct 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.549
 nation and we give balance and harmony to the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.400
 room and if it is a room 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.920
 Baroque inspiration is allowed to use 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 the color with freedom then the style 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.689
 baroque privileges spaces 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.090
 recharged and intense you can see that in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.369
 this case has been opted for walls in 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 bright yellow carpets and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.229
 Patterned curtains with patterns on 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.810
 yellow and upholstered furniture in one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.149
 similar hue in this way is not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
 look for the contrast but the continuity 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.140
 there is also an option for you to use 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.390
 the yellow using so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.759
 balanced and combining it with 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.340
 brown and earth tones 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 composition is one of the most appropriate 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.990
 for a classic and simple stay 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.690
 since yellow does not result 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 invasive as in the baroque style but 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.369
 brings more warmth than style 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.009
 minimalist that can be somewhat 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.259
