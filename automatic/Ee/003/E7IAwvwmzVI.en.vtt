modes<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.130> terms<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.459> firepower<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:44.280> multi

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
modes in terms of firepower so do multi

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.400 
modes in terms of firepower so do multi
targeting<00:02:45.060> with<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.209> missiles<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.900> strafe

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
targeting with your missiles and strafe

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.729 
targeting with your missiles and strafe
runs<00:02:46.620> with<00:02:46.739> your<00:02:46.860> cannon<00:02:47.130> fire<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:49.620> thing

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
runs with your cannon fire so one thing

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.780 
runs with your cannon fire so one thing
you<00:02:49.860> should<00:02:50.069> really<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.459> about<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
you should really know about the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
you should really know about the
different<00:02:51.090> versions<00:02:51.450> are<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.019> different

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
different versions are the different

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.870 
different versions are the different
power<00:02:53.100> abilities<00:02:54.060> between<00:02:54.660> your<00:02:54.780> weapons<00:02:55.230> so

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
power abilities between your weapons so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.910 
power abilities between your weapons so
fighter<00:02:56.880> mode<00:02:57.180> has<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.050> strongest<00:02:58.470> cannon

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
fighter mode has the strongest cannon

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.440 
fighter mode has the strongest cannon
fire<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.430> the<00:03:00.000> heaviest<00:03:01.310> missile<00:03:02.310> attack<00:03:02.640> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
fire and the heaviest missile attack so

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.360 
fire and the heaviest missile attack so
it's<00:03:03.660> sort<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> heavy<00:03:04.830> punch<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's sort of like a heavy punch or a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.090 
it's sort of like a heavy punch or a
heavy<00:03:05.550> kick<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.360> light<00:03:06.540> kick<00:03:06.780> sorwe<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
heavy kick and a light kick sorwe the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.500 
heavy kick and a light kick sorwe the
trade-off<00:03:08.489> though<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.120> missiles

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
trade-off though is that your missiles

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.729 
trade-off though is that your missiles
are<00:03:09.630> not<00:03:09.780> nearly<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:10.260> maneuverable<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:12.739> say

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
are not nearly as maneuverable as say

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.780 
are not nearly as maneuverable as say
the<00:03:13.769> light<00:03:14.100> missiles<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:15.170> Guardian<00:03:16.170> mode

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
the light missiles in Guardian mode

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.580 
the light missiles in Guardian mode
so<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.120> Guardian<00:03:18.630> mode<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.110> obviously<00:03:19.470> have

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so in Guardian mode you obviously have

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800 
so in Guardian mode you obviously have
missiles<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> cannon<00:03:21.000> fire<00:03:21.180> your<00:03:21.480> cannon

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
missiles and cannon fire your cannon

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470 
missiles and cannon fire your cannon
fire<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:23.000> relatively<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> same

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
fire is relatively the same

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.479 
fire is relatively the same
I<00:03:24.780> think<00:03:25.170> his<00:03:25.260> battle<00:03:25.560> Lloyd<00:03:25.709> mode<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.160> haven't

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I think his battle Lloyd mode I haven't

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.160 
I think his battle Lloyd mode I haven't
really<00:03:26.640> noticed<00:03:26.670> too<00:03:27.060> many<00:03:27.239> differences<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
really noticed too many differences it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.330 
really noticed too many differences it
might<00:03:28.350> be<00:03:28.470> slightly<00:03:28.769> stronger<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:31.070> your<00:03:32.070> but

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
might be slightly stronger and your but

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.190 
might be slightly stronger and your but
your<00:03:32.489> missiles<00:03:32.880> though<00:03:33.090> are<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.660> nearly<00:03:34.079> as

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
your missiles though are not nearly as

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.410 
your missiles though are not nearly as
strong<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.769> fired<00:03:35.010> mode<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:36.180> they<00:03:36.299> are

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
strong as in fired mode but they are

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.300 
strong as in fired mode but they are
much<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:37.079> maneuverable<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.010> actually

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
much more maneuverable you can actually

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.460 
much more maneuverable you can actually
shoot<00:03:38.519> around<00:03:38.820> corners<00:03:38.959> with<00:03:39.959> them<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.350> you've

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
shoot around corners with them if you've

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 
shoot around corners with them if you've
locked<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.400> I'll<00:03:41.730> show<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.299> trick

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
locked on and I'll show you that trick

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.170 
locked on and I'll show you that trick
later<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:44.100> once<00:03:44.250> you've<00:03:44.370> taken<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.760> those

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
later on so once you've taken out those

later on so once you've taken out those

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
minute and if you're too close you can

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.470 
minute and if you're too close you can
fail<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> mission<00:04:07.799> by<00:04:08.280> dying<00:04:09.000> from<00:04:09.299> its

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
fail the mission by dying from its

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.930 
fail the mission by dying from its

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
explosion but I've pretty much never had

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.960 
explosion but I've pretty much never had
a<00:04:11.970> problem<00:04:12.239> if<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.870> stay<00:04:13.260> in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
a problem if you stay in

past the front of this entrada Cruiser

past the front of this entrada Cruiser
so<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:18.900> you're<00:04:19.020> out<00:04:19.230> between<00:04:19.800> the<00:04:20.370> front<00:04:20.670> and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
so if you're out between the front and

in-between USDF one you're probably too

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.250 
in-between USDF one you're probably too
close<00:04:23.430> you'll<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.390> warning<00:04:24.630> from<00:04:24.810> Izzy

part you want to be doing a lot of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.890 
part you want to be doing a lot of
rolling<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.910> lot<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.180> boosting<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.660> fighter

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
rolling a lot of boosting and fighter

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.240 
rolling a lot of boosting and fighter
mode<00:05:10.110> I<00:05:11.000> don't<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.180> what<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.890> limit<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:13.980> on

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
mode I don't know what the limit is on

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.000 
mode I don't know what the limit is on
the<00:05:14.370> number<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.610> battle<00:05:14.910> pods<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:16.560> quite<00:05:16.980> a

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
the number of battle pods it is quite a

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.710 
the number of battle pods it is quite a
bit<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.370> them<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.820> think<00:05:18.120> it's<00:05:18.240> based<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.570> how

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
bit of them I think it's based on how

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.080 
bit of them I think it's based on how
many<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:19.050> shoot<00:05:19.260> down<00:05:19.490> before<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.610> barrier

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
many you shoot down before the barrier

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.860 
many you shoot down before the barrier
starts<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.960> go<00:05:23.810> see<00:05:24.810> what's<00:05:25.140> going<00:05:25.440> on<00:05:26.870> the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
starts to go see what's going on the

starts to go see what's going on the
story<00:05:28.140> does<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.380> pretty<00:05:28.620> good<00:05:28.710> job<00:05:29.750> as<00:05:30.750> far<00:05:31.620> as

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
story does a pretty good job as far as

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.790

keeping in line with the macro saga I do

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800 
keeping in line with the macro saga I do
remember<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:35.430> at<00:05:35.970> this<00:05:36.210> point<00:05:36.510> you're

probably about a quarter of the way
through<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.870> first<00:05:40.110> series<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.680> you're<00:05:40.980> only

actually holding the city hostage in a
ways<00:06:01.080> because<00:06:01.590> like<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.610> said<00:06:02.730> earth<00:06:03.060> wouldn't

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
ways because like I said earth wouldn't

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.960 
ways because like I said earth wouldn't
let<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.690> people<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.920> SDF<00:06:05.280> one<00:06:05.490> come<00:06:05.760> back

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
let the people of the SDF one come back

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.380

so<00:06:06.920> global<00:06:07.920> was<00:06:08.130> basically<00:06:08.520> saying<00:06:08.820> hovering

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
so global was basically saying hovering

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.510 
so global was basically saying hovering
over<00:06:09.630> here<00:06:09.780> saying<00:06:10.080> you<00:06:10.170> know<00:06:10.290> give<00:06:11.160> us<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.340> safe

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
over here saying you know give us a safe

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.310 
over here saying you know give us a safe
haven<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:12.030> I'll<00:06:12.180> I'll<00:06:12.450> get<00:06:12.630> out<00:06:12.780> of<00:06:12.930> here<00:06:13.080> but

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
haven and I'll I'll get out of here but

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.740 
haven and I'll I'll get out of here but
till<00:06:13.890> then<00:06:14.040> and<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:15.000> course<00:06:15.240> there's<00:06:15.510> an<00:06:15.600> try

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
till then and of course there's an try

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.810 
till then and of course there's an try
to<00:06:15.810> attack<00:06:16.170> and<00:06:16.470> then<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.920> untested<00:06:17.520> barrier

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
to attack and then this untested barrier

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.580 
to attack and then this untested barrier
system<00:06:18.180> actually<00:06:18.540> backfires<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.140> blows

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
system actually backfires and blows

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.860 
system actually backfires and blows
everything<00:06:19.860> to<00:06:20.070> kingdom<00:06:20.430> come

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.110 

I<00:06:23.900> think<00:06:24.530> that's<00:06:24.710> about<00:06:24.830> it<00:06:25.220> so<00:06:25.490> yeah<00:06:25.700> here

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
I think that's about it so yeah here

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.390 
I think that's about it so yeah here
comes<00:06:26.420> the<00:06:26.570> warning<00:06:26.930> when<00:06:27.260> you<00:06:27.350> see<00:06:27.530> that<00:06:27.710> just
