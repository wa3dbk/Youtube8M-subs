noticeable<00:00:32.850> difference<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.170> health<00:00:34.350> bar

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
noticeable difference I'm the health bar

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
noticeable difference I'm the health bar
is<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:34.920> different<00:00:35.460> like<00:00:35.670> Boulder

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is a little bit different like Boulder

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.450 
is a little bit different like Boulder
texture<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.500> health<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
texture but the the health that is a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.330 
texture but the the health that is a
beaming<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.660> Ender<00:00:39.930> Dragon<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> much

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
beaming to the Ender Dragon is a much

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.850 
beaming to the Ender Dragon is a much
different<00:00:41.450> texture<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> pc<00:00:43.410> version<00:00:43.440> it's

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
different texture in the pc version it's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
different texture in the pc version it's
kind<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> transparent<00:00:45.329> type<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> haze

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
kind of like a transparent type of haze

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
kind of like a transparent type of haze
that<00:00:47.010> gets<00:00:47.190> transported<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> dragon<00:00:48.420> but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that gets transported to the dragon but

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
that gets transported to the dragon but
this<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.289> nice<00:00:49.469> purple<00:00:49.920> texture

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this one is a very nice purple texture

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.000 
this one is a very nice purple texture
so<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> texture<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.530> new<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
so the texture of that is a very new and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
so the texture of that is a very new and
as<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> items<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:55.199> he's<00:00:55.410> in

creative mode you can see that the signs
are<00:00:57.660> stackable<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> 16mm<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> xbox<00:00:59.969> right<00:01:00.120> now

ender in the end portal frame so we know

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.490 
ender in the end portal frame so we know
that<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> end<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.350> there

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that the end was going to be in there

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
that the end was going to be in there
and<00:01:13.619> again<00:01:13.890> signs<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.670> stackable<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> all

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
and again signs are stackable and all

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.190 
and again signs are stackable and all
these<00:01:16.170> um<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:17.310> these<00:01:18.030> spawn<00:01:18.299> eggs<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
these um all these spawn eggs are up to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
these um all these spawn eggs are up to
16<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> could<00:01:20.009> mean<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> spawn<00:01:21.479> eggs

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
16 that could mean that the spawn eggs

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
16 that could mean that the spawn eggs
are<00:01:21.780> stackable<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> 16<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:22.950> stackable

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
are stackable to 16 they are stackable

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.300 
are stackable to 16 they are stackable
to<00:01:23.490> 64<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.930> pc<00:01:25.409> version<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.890> maybe<00:01:26.130> they

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to 64 in the pc version but maybe they

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
to 64 in the pc version but maybe they
cap<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.880> 16<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.540> will<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.049> nothing

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
cap it out at 16 we will see but nothing

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.870 
cap it out at 16 we will see but nothing
new<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> spawn<00:01:29.579> eggs<00:01:29.759> we

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
my bottom left hand corner as you can
see<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.079> map<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> slight

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

difference on the map I don't think the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
difference on the map I don't think the
map<00:01:37.200> size<00:01:37.470> has<00:01:37.680> gotten<00:01:37.950> bigger<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
map size has gotten bigger what is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
map size has gotten bigger what is
