organic raspberries and my raspberries I
like<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> frozen<00:01:30.329> reason<00:01:31.290> being<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.799> because

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
like a frozen reason being is because

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
like a frozen reason being is because
this<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.360> ice<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this this is my ice and I like a little

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
this this is my ice and I like a little

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
bit thicker and a little bit colder so I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
bit thicker and a little bit colder so I
use<00:01:36.689> frozen<00:01:36.990> raspberries<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.829> ice<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.270> have

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
use frozen raspberries as ice so we have

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
use frozen raspberries as ice so we have
that<00:01:39.979> all<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.100> let's<00:01:41.310> get<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> detoxing

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that all right let's get to detoxing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.210 
that all right let's get to detoxing
let's<00:01:42.930> add<00:01:43.140> our<00:01:43.290> fruits<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> vegetables

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
let's add our fruits and vegetables

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.719 
let's add our fruits and vegetables
first

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
first

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.880 
first
okay<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.750> berries<00:01:46.140> first<00:01:48.229> do<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.380> spinach

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
okay so berries first do our spinach

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.670 
okay so berries first do our spinach
next<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.560> this<00:01:52.560> makes<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.130> two<00:01:53.640> smoothies

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
next and this makes about two smoothies

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.929 
next and this makes about two smoothies
so<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.950> decrease<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> need<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so you can decrease that if you need to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:08.199 
so you can decrease that if you need to
make<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.149> one

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.280 

all<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.720> member<00:02:09.959> our<00:02:10.170> liquid<00:02:10.619> light

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
all right so member our liquid light

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.840 
all right so member our liquid light
we're<00:02:13.290> gonna<00:02:13.380> do<00:02:13.560> one<00:02:13.770> cat<00:02:14.130> full<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.610> liquid
