00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:05.412
And the award for the least appealing blind
bag design goes to ... Simba, who else?

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.465
Even if they are just
distributing this for

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:10.767
another company. It's
"Yoohoo &amp; Friends"!

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:16.145
Boy oh boy, this design is so
generic it hurts. It could

00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:19.110
contain about anything,
but it's supposed to

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.610
have one of 26 animals
to collect and trade.

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:24.110
With a little heart. I'm
looking forward to

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.038
this already. The back has about
the same text as the front,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.636
"Contains: 1 figure, 1
booklet" - of course

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.641
- and a trading card,
who'd have expected that!

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:33.918
Right.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.351
Can't do much else than
check what's inside.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.428
Let's do it!

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:40.781
Booklet.

00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:42.761
"Trading Card".

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:44.684
Oh, it's a panda!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.282
"Species: Panda bear"

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.072
"The chubby 'Ringring'
likes it cozy."

00:00:50.938 --> 00:00:54.948
Good for him! Is this the chubby ...
what IS that?!

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.645
Hello, you aren't a
panda bear at all!?

00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:01.304
You are ... something ...
but definitely no panda.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.045
Mh ... other than that,
it feels a bit like pelt.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.057
But it's damn ugly! Sit
over there, will you?

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:12.595
Let the grown-ups find out
what else we can get. Aha!

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:20.507
"Yoohoo", "RooDee", "Chewoo", "Loonee" ...
I can see where this is going.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.570
Oh man, it's indeed "Ringring".

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.422
Wait a second ...
it's "Ringring".

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.721
"The chubby Ringring".

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:33.058
This is what a panda
bear looks like today?

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:36.371
I wouldn't dare to claim this has
anything to do with a panda bear.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.392
It looks more like a

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:40.211
small monkey or something,
but not like a panda bear.

00:01:40.698 --> 00:01:41.807
Awesome!

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:44.996
Anything else? Can you play
with them or somesuch nonsense?

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:47.572
"Yoohoo and friends have
to find the seeds for the"

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:51.812
tree of life to save their
home planet Yootoopia."

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.919
"Will they succeed
against all odds"

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.566
"before the next polar light
appears over the north pole?"

00:01:58.196 --> 00:01:59.683
I suspect they will.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.498
"On their long adventure,
they find a lot"

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:04.998
"of new friends who ..."

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.498
No. "who help them
on their journey."

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.107
Like for example these fellows.
"LibbyLenny"

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.034
and "Rhino" and "Nook" and ... what
the hell, they all look the same!

00:02:15.524 --> 00:02:18.191
They have nothing to do
with animals at all!

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:20.115
And they aren't my friends!

00:02:20.232 --> 00:02:21.531
See you next time!
