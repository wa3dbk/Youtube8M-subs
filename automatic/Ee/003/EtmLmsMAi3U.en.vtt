00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.120
 the action is fought welcome to another 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.070
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.960
 title new information about the robberies 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.280
 to banks and this is an information that 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.959
 I wanted to give in today because 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.299
 I found several things that seem to me 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.549
 quite interesting so we're going to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.770
 start with them and I'm telling you 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.600
 each one since they are pretty good ok 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.580
 first of all we can be 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.230
 seeing an image which we will have seen 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.870
 in the trailer of bank robberies 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.210
 but as you can see, we see a charge 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.860
 which is loading a car but not 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.600
 is loading it with a normal crane 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.359
 but it's loading it with this 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.160
 magnet article then this makes us 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.409
 think about the possibility that we 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.210
 we can add new parts to the 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.800
 vehicles that we had like they can be 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.109
 helicopters and this seems pretty 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 interesting now we may be seeing 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.510
 the photo of a motorcycle in which 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.059
 we had previously many people will be able 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.550
 say it's beat it anybody but if 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 we make a count of the letters we can 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.739
 see that the first letter that is not seen 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.559
 very well is a p the penultimate is a p 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.479
 and the last one is an e and this is the only one 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.240
 brand that exists that matches 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.549
 prince and if we see the codes 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.040
 and have been found this is going to be the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.200
 prince electro is not this sports bike 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.850
 that the truth looks pretty good and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.390
 I think it can be compared to the bat 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.670
 801 since the bad and 801 is related to a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.520
 Ducati and this may also Kiko 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.140
 see him let's see another type of motorcycle 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.670
 but if we see it, it does not match as much 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.679
 with the first bike we saw the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.110
 principle then this makes us think 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.210
 that this is probably going to be another 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.429
 type of bike which we are going to have in the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.770
 trailer of bank robberies and this 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.470
 bike we have seen the codes and we know 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.549
 which is the enduro farm, you will not know 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.920
 what good is he doing to do 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.020
 motorcycles like dinka and solÃ¡ being a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.729
 frost then this is the possible 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.799
 motorcycle as they see it they will make 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.720
 these two new motorcycles and more than 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.880
 nothing I wanted to teach is now something 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 that I know many people will not have noticed 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 and caused quite an impression is that I have 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.000
 noticed that all the helicopters that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.610
 are usually in the trailer or in 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.649
 images already have turrets I do not know 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.360
 if they are automatic turrets but the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.039
 truth is something that looks pretty good 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.290
 we did not see this in the trailer but yes 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.840
 we saw the pictures they took in the forum 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.030
 of hygiene we could have noticed 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 also here we see what he is doing 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.030
 a turret in the helicopter I do not know if 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.860
 will be able to add articles or 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.830
 accessories because if you noticed 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.989
 the charge also has an accessory and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.390
 this is surely going to be the baby 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.519
 guardian key that is believed in the codes 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.200
 which is a helicopter but not the charge 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.209
 bob the truth I do not know how we are going to have 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.819
 that accessories and we need to pick them up 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.489
 and here as they see it we see a vehicle of 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.319
 modern warfare 2 also in warfare 3 and 3 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.810
 they will say because we see a vehicle of a 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.489
 saga that does not belong to the title then 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.500
 well you can remember that we saw 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.660
 the technical karim to what is this then 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.459
 I do not know if he's going to see other vans 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.280
 that also have these as the anding 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.349
 xl and if you notice it on the right we see a 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.450
 new truck I do not know so it's going to be 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.920
 I do not know if I'm going to transport but how 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.750
 see also in the codes that we had 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 seen that we were going to have a new truck 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.680
 I do not know if they change backwards 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120
 fully armed or you have but the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 true that looks pretty good no 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.510
 besides they remember that we had 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.519
 seen something from the pc so I do not know if 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.680
 this is another front that will have the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.569
 game and the truth that looks pretty 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.590
 alright so the guys you tell me 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.090
 your opinion in the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.310
 I want to know what they think about it 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 but I wanted to tell you more than anything 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.170
 like the new names and some things 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.849
 that came to me from today 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.500
 I've put more to analyze the trailer well 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.239
 I hope you like this one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.459

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.349
