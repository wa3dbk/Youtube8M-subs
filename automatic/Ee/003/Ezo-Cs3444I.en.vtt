00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
woodpecker and it's a really tough bird

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.779 
woodpecker and it's a really tough bird
to<00:01:59.960> photograph<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.950> what<00:02:01.130> I've<00:02:01.249> done<00:02:01.429> is<00:02:01.490> I've

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
to photograph so what I've done is I've

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.489 
to photograph so what I've done is I've
used<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.209> natural<00:02:02.389> feeding<00:02:02.959> behavior<00:02:03.409> of

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
used a natural feeding behavior of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.260 
used a natural feeding behavior of
feeding<00:02:03.950> on<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.219> sides<00:02:04.459> of<00:02:04.609> trees<00:02:04.969> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
feeding on the sides of trees and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.770 
feeding on the sides of trees and
branches<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.579> I've<00:02:07.579> drilled<00:02:07.880> holes<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:08.630> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
branches and I've drilled holes in the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.140 
branches and I've drilled holes in the
side<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.440> what<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.009> do<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.520> laced<00:02:10.940> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
side and what I do is I just laced that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.270 
side and what I do is I just laced that
with<00:02:11.330> lard<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:12.170> doesn't<00:02:12.500> clog<00:02:12.680> their<00:02:12.920> feathers

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
with lard it doesn't clog their feathers

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.730 
with lard it doesn't clog their feathers
very<00:02:13.910> rich<00:02:14.180> source<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.630> food<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.440> know<00:02:15.560> some

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
very rich source of food you know some

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.080 
very rich source of food you know some
people<00:02:15.830> would<00:02:16.010> say<00:02:16.130> that's<00:02:16.280> cheating

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
people would say that's cheating

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.750 
people would say that's cheating
it's<00:02:17.420> adapting<00:02:18.380> their<00:02:18.560> natural<00:02:18.980> behavior<00:02:19.550> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
it's adapting their natural behavior and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.070 
it's adapting their natural behavior and
I<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.360> set<00:02:20.510> up<00:02:20.599> this<00:02:20.720> feeding

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
I can see you set up this feeding

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.330 
I can see you set up this feeding
station<00:02:21.410> you've<00:02:21.530> got<00:02:21.650> my<00:02:21.830> disease<00:02:22.160> which

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
they're actually a really big bird I was

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.259 
they're actually a really big bird I was
a<00:03:33.230> bit<00:03:33.350> worried<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.739> having<00:03:34.280> been<00:03:34.489> given<00:03:35.030> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
a bit worried of having been given the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.090 
a bit worried of having been given the
most<00:03:35.420> amazing<00:03:35.900> opportunity<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.500> take<00:03:36.709> photos

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
most amazing opportunity to take photos

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.520 
most amazing opportunity to take photos
that<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.280> might<00:03:37.519> stuff<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.910> up<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:38.299> actually<00:03:39.079> I

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that I might stuff it up but actually I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.660 
that I might stuff it up but actually I
think<00:03:40.489> that's<00:03:40.700> berry<00:03:40.940> better<00:03:41.209> know<00:03:41.989> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670
