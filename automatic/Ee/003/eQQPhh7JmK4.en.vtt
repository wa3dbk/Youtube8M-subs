projects like this in a sense it's one

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.610 
projects like this in a sense it's one
of<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.820> major<00:04:43.270> reasons<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:43.810> run<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.140> project

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
of the major reasons we run the project

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.580 
of the major reasons we run the project
is<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.160> inform<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> public<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.930> educate<00:04:47.380> them

is to inform the public to educate them
to<00:04:47.680> just<00:04:47.860> give<00:04:48.040> them<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.370> nice<00:04:48.520> experience

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
to just give them a nice experience

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.030 
to just give them a nice experience
really<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.320> they<00:04:50.440> can<00:04:50.620> connect<00:04:50.950> with

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
really so that they can connect with

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.490 
really so that they can connect with
nature<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:52.450> could<00:04:52.630> such<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.840> dependency<00:04:53.470> on

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
is great news with slow signs of

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.219 
is great news with slow signs of
recovery<00:05:15.699> from<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.240> recession<00:05:16.360> it's

recovery from the recession it's

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.110

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
faced by conservation today I think

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.550 
faced by conservation today I think
public<00:05:22.419> involvements<00:05:22.900> going<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.080> become<00:05:23.350> more

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
public involvements going to become more

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.920 
public involvements going to become more

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
and more crucial as years go on because

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.230 
and more crucial as years go on because
funding<00:05:26.590> form<00:05:26.919> external<00:05:27.550> sources<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.120> from

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
the government is dwindling and so you

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.129
