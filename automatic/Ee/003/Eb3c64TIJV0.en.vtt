00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.230 
adorable and really springy if it's a
little<00:01:27.320> bit<00:01:27.439> dressier<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.219> think<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.909> paired

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
little bit dressier I think so I paired

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.030 
little bit dressier I think so I paired
just<00:01:29.600> some<00:01:29.750> plain<00:01:30.020> black<00:01:30.320> flats<00:01:30.680> with<00:01:30.890> it

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
just some plain black flats with it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.069 
just some plain black flats with it
therefore<00:01:31.280> maurices<00:01:31.939> they<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.869> lace

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
therefore maurices they have a lace

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.810 
therefore maurices they have a lace
pattern<00:01:33.110> being<00:01:33.560> here<00:01:33.710> they<00:01:33.860> tell<00:01:34.009> smile<00:01:34.520> or
