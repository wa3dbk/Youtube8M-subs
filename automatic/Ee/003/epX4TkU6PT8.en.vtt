00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
to three mile an hour note that I did

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.480 
to three mile an hour note that I did
not<00:02:15.540> use<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.020> clutch<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.890> tractor<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
picking the particular rpm necessary

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.280 
picking the particular rpm necessary
just<00:02:20.550> for<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> amount<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.660> pulling<00:02:21.930> force

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
just for the amount of pulling force

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
just for the amount of pulling force
that<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.560> has<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.550> put<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> plow

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that it has on it so if you put a plow

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.570 
that it has on it so if you put a plow
on<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.450> chances<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.740> you're<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.280> you're

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
on it chances are if you're just you're

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.780 
on it chances are if you're just you're
picking<00:02:26.940> your<00:02:27.090> speed<00:02:27.360> with<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.830> if

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
picking your speed with this so if

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.790 
picking your speed with this so if
you're<00:02:30.060> at<00:02:30.210> three<00:02:30.540> miles<00:02:30.750> an<00:02:30.960> hour<00:02:31.140> pulling<00:02:31.740> a

you're at three miles an hour pulling a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
plow chances are the tractors can be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840

three mile an hour no clutch clutch less
shifting<00:03:18.980> forward<00:03:19.400> reverse<00:03:19.670> I'll<00:03:20.000> go<00:03:20.150> back<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
shifting forward reverse I'll go back to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.670 
shifting forward reverse I'll go back to
reverse<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:23.060> here<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:23.330> go<00:03:23.480> back<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.440> three

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
reverse and here we go back to three

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.309 
reverse and here we go back to three
mile<00:03:24.860> an<00:03:25.040> hour

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.920 

right<00:03:31.950> now<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.579> put<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.939> tractor<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.450> forward

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
right now we put the tractor and forward

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.599 
right now we put the tractor and forward
I<00:03:34.140> know<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.069> see<00:03:35.250> that's<00:03:35.459> our

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
I know if you can see that's our

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.580 
I know if you can see that's our
mile-per-hour<00:03:35.879> gates<00:03:36.629> there<00:03:36.989> we're<00:03:37.260> hoping

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
mile-per-hour gates there we're hoping

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.160 
mile-per-hour gates there we're hoping
for<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.920> best<00:03:38.329> where<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.450> stopped<00:03:39.750> right<00:03:40.019> now

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
for the best where it stopped right now

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.869 
for the best where it stopped right now
once<00:03:40.379> again<00:03:40.590> nope<00:03:40.890> lunch<00:03:41.189> I'm<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.819> to

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
once again nope lunch I'm just going to

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.449 
once again nope lunch I'm just going to
pick<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> forward<00:03:42.569> gear<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.769> there<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.099> go<00:03:44.250> we're

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
pick a forward gear so there we go we're

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.539 
pick a forward gear so there we go we're
going<00:03:44.510> 3.4<00:03:45.510> miles<00:03:45.719> an<00:03:45.989> hour<00:03:46.170> no<00:03:46.379> clutch<00:03:46.709> now

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
going 3.4 miles an hour no clutch now

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.599 
going 3.4 miles an hour no clutch now
we're<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:47.970> cut<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.359> up<00:03:48.569> in<00:03:48.750> couple<00:03:49.049> bits

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
we're going to cut on up in couple bits

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.849 
we're going to cut on up in couple bits
so<00:03:50.609> tractors<00:03:51.299> adjust<00:03:51.689> in<00:03:51.840> rpm<00:03:52.260> as<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.650> needs

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
so tractors adjust in rpm as it needs

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.280 
so tractors adjust in rpm as it needs
for<00:03:53.159> at<00:03:53.250> 7<00:03:53.609> miles<00:03:53.760> an<00:03:54.000> hour<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.659> cannot<00:03:54.959> feel

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
for at 7 miles an hour you cannot feel

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.470 
for at 7 miles an hour you cannot feel
anything<00:03:55.590> shifting<00:03:56.340> now<00:03:57.150> we're<00:03:57.299> going<00:03:57.420> to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
anything shifting now we're going to

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.199 
anything shifting now we're going to
slow<00:03:57.659> down<00:03:58.310> that<00:03:59.310> was<00:03:59.459> pretty<00:03:59.639> well<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.970> stuff

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
slow down that was pretty well of stuff

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.280 
slow down that was pretty well of stuff
so<00:04:01.099> we<00:04:02.099> get<00:04:02.310> back<00:04:02.519> up<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.819> speed<00:04:02.939> here<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:04.079> more

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
so we get back up to speed here the more

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.289 
so we get back up to speed here the more
you<00:04:04.439> push<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.680> control<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.790> quicker<00:04:06.060> it's

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
you push the control the quicker it's

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.910 
you push the control the quicker it's
going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> pick<00:04:06.720> up<00:04:06.959> when<00:04:07.200> we<00:04:07.409> reduce<00:04:07.560> your

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
going to pick up when we reduce your

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.550 
going to pick up when we reduce your
speed<00:04:08.569> so<00:04:09.569> I'll<00:04:09.659> just<00:04:09.810> go<00:04:09.959> lightly<00:04:10.230> there

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
speed so I'll just go lightly there

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.039 
speed so I'll just go lightly there
there<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.950> go<00:04:10.980> lost<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.609> mile<00:04:11.790> an<00:04:12.000> hour<00:04:12.120> once

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
there you go lost a mile an hour once

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.490 
there you go lost a mile an hour once
again<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.470> feel<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> little<00:04:13.889> shifting<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.239> now

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
again you feel a little shifting so now

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.199 
again you feel a little shifting so now
we're<00:04:16.500> out<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> lot<00:04:16.949> here<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.639> get<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> tractor

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
we're out a lot here you get the tractor

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:27.450 
we're out a lot here you get the tractor
turned<00:04:18.509> around

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.300 

then<00:04:27.910> we'll<00:04:28.000> go<00:04:28.150> out<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.449> speed<00:04:29.039> nope<00:04:30.039> maybe

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
then we'll go out to speed nope maybe

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.800 
then we'll go out to speed nope maybe
you'll<00:04:30.610> be<00:04:30.729> able<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:31.030> hear<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.330> engine<00:04:31.509> noise

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
you'll be able to hear the engine noise

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.379 
you'll be able to hear the engine noise
I'll<00:04:32.740> go<00:04:32.919> up<00:04:33.100> here

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.550 

I'll<00:04:36.870> do

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.740 

about<00:04:40.160> eleven<00:04:40.550> mile<00:04:40.700> an<00:04:40.910> hour<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.390> did<00:04:41.540> not

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
about eleven mile an hour you did not

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.900 
about eleven mile an hour you did not
feel<00:04:41.990> any<00:04:42.200> shift<00:04:42.530> in<00:04:42.710> any<00:04:42.980> normal<00:04:43.190> power<00:04:43.610> shift

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
feel any shift in any normal power shift

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.460 
feel any shift in any normal power shift
tractor<00:04:44.480> you<00:04:44.600> would<00:04:44.750> have<00:04:44.870> shifted<00:04:45.050> through

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
tractor you would have shifted through

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.990 
tractor you would have shifted through
about<00:04:45.680> ten<00:04:45.950> years<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.490> you'd<00:04:46.610> feel<00:04:46.790> the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
about ten years and you'd feel the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.550 
about ten years and you'd feel the
engine<00:04:47.270> go<00:04:48.850> once<00:04:49.850> again<00:04:50.120> no<00:04:50.810> throttle<00:04:51.110> it's

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
engine go once again no throttle it's

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.230 
engine go once again no throttle it's
just<00:04:51.890> controlling<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.430> throttle<00:04:52.760> on<00:04:52.910> its<00:04:53.060> own

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
just controlling the throttle on its own

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.300 
just controlling the throttle on its own
I<00:04:53.480> can<00:04:53.810> manually<00:04:54.200> adjust<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.650> throttle<00:04:54.890> as<00:04:55.160> I

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
I can manually adjust the throttle as I

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:04.730 
I can manually adjust the throttle as I
need<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.930> there's<00:04:57.140> no<00:04:57.290> need<00:04:57.500> for<00:04:57.530> that

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740
