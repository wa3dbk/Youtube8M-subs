guys and look for a product that's
called<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.240> texture<00:00:22.050> paint<00:00:22.500> additive<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.400> what

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
called a texture paint additive and what

called a texture paint additive and what
you<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.810> add<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.460> sand<00:00:26.460> grit<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.510> a

you do is you add that sand grit or a

you do is you add that sand grit or a
whatever<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> vermiculite<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.580> something

whatever it is vermiculite or something
it's<00:00:30.269> different<00:00:30.539> levels<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.990> texture<00:00:31.380> follow

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
it's different levels of texture follow

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
it's different levels of texture follow
the<00:00:32.130> directions<00:00:32.399> mix<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.059> your<00:00:33.239> paint

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the directions mix it into your paint

and put it on your walls as as it tells
you<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> instructions<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.989> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you to do in the instructions that is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
you to do in the instructions that is
how<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> create<00:00:40.559> texture<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.090> paint<00:00:42.420> if

how to create texture with your paint if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.930 
how to create texture with your paint if
you<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:42.930> want<00:00:43.290> texture<00:00:43.829> another<00:00:44.730> way

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you actually want texture another way

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
you actually want texture another way
that<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> developed<00:00:46.170> some<00:00:46.649> many<00:00:46.800> years

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that I kind of developed some many years

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
that I kind of developed some many years
ago<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.989> create<00:00:49.410> texture<00:00:50.180> without<00:00:51.180> having

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ago to create texture without having

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.279 
ago to create texture without having
texture<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.239> by<00:00:54.239> printing<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:56.210> paint<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
texture is by printing the paint on to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.319 
texture is by printing the paint on to
the<00:00:58.320> surface<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.010> plastic<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:01:00.149> going

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the surface with plastic and I'm going

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
the surface with plastic and I'm going
to<00:01:00.359> show<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.320> first

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to show you how to do that the first

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.789 
to show you how to do that the first
thing<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> three<00:01:03.180> mil

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
thing is to use about a three mil

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.730 
thing is to use about a three mil
plastic<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.280> means<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> fairly<00:01:06.090> thin<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
plastic that means it's fairly thin and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.830 
plastic that means it's fairly thin and
cut<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.010> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.820> random<00:01:09.240> shapes<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.720> you're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
cut a lot of random shapes so you're

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
cut a lot of random shapes so you're
only<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.439> each<00:01:10.680> piece<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.340> time

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
only going to use each piece one time

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
only going to use each piece one time
what<00:01:12.330> will<00:01:12.450> happen<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.110> going

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
what will happen is that you are going

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
what will happen is that you are going
to<00:01:13.710> paint<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.820> color<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.580> whole<00:01:17.580> half<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to paint your color on one whole half of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
to paint your color on one whole half of
your<00:01:18.180> plastic<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.350> close<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
your plastic and then close it with the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.270 
your plastic and then close it with the
other<00:01:20.430> half<00:01:20.780> just<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.200> fun<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:23.040> two

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
other half just for fun I have two

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.510 
other half just for fun I have two
colors<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.750> create<00:01:25.560> two<00:01:26.009> completely

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
colors so we can create two completely

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.539 
colors so we can create two completely
different<00:01:26.790> textural<00:01:27.420> looks<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.520> happen<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
different textural looks I happen to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
different textural looks I happen to
have<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> brush<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> use<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
have a brush here so I'm going to use it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
have a brush here so I'm going to use it
rather<00:01:32.159> than<00:01:32.430> mussing<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.420> another<00:01:33.750> roller

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
rather than mussing up another roller

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.410 
rather than mussing up another roller
and<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.979> am<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.490> simply<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.560> put<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and I am just simply going to put this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
and I am just simply going to put this
glaze<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> water-based<00:01:43.220> over<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> whole

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
glaze it's a water-based over the whole

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
glaze it's a water-based over the whole
surface<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> an

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
surface and I would have an

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
surface and I would have an
assembly-line<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.189> these<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.520> many<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.820> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
assembly-line of these as many as I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
assembly-line of these as many as I
could<00:01:48.119> handle<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.659> once<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.020> start<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.439> print

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
could handle so once I start to print

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
could handle so once I start to print
this<00:01:50.130> plastic<00:01:50.640> onto<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> wall<00:01:51.180> which<00:01:51.479> you'll

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this plastic onto the wall which you'll

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
this plastic onto the wall which you'll
see<00:01:51.840> soon<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.710> cover<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
see soon that I can cover a lot of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
see soon that I can cover a lot of
square<00:01:56.640> footage<00:01:56.820> at<00:01:57.090> once<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:58.409> I'm

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
square footage at once and then I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
square footage at once and then I'm
going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> simply<00:01:59.189> fold<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.850> over<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
going to simply fold this over it so it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.539 
going to simply fold this over it so it
doesn't<00:02:01.049> dry<00:02:01.259> before<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> chance<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
doesn't dry before I have a chance to

doesn't dry before I have a chance to
get<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.630> wall<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.829> over<00:02:05.460> an

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
get it to the wall and this over an

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
get it to the wall and this over an
existing<00:02:06.299> color<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.990> imprint<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.680> lighter

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
existing color will imprint a lighter

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.300 
existing color will imprint a lighter
pattern<00:02:08.729> versus<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.509> darker<00:02:09.989> pattern<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.590> if

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
pattern versus the darker pattern or if

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.070 
pattern versus the darker pattern or if
you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.610> lots<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.120> texture<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> want<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you want lots of texture and you want to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
you want lots of texture and you want to
go<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
go to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
go to
down<00:02:13.560> start<00:02:14.100> with<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> dark<00:02:14.580> top<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> off<00:02:15.300> with

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
down start with the dark top it off with

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.230 
down start with the dark top it off with
the<00:02:15.660> light<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.270> my<00:02:18.510> painted<00:02:19.020> plastic

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
the light so I have my painted plastic

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.930 
the light so I have my painted plastic
ready<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.420> print<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.990> have<00:02:22.280> my<00:02:23.280> painted

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
ready to print and I have my painted

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.210 
ready to print and I have my painted
wall<00:02:24.120> sort<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.660> earthy<00:02:25.530> green<00:02:26.930> I'm<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:27.990> to

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
wall sort of a earthy green I'm going to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.990 
wall sort of a earthy green I'm going to
simply<00:02:29.240> unfold<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.050> now<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:32.000> larger

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
simply unfold it so now I have a larger

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.090 
simply unfold it so now I have a larger
area<00:02:33.030> than<00:02:33.890> initially<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.680> ink<00:02:37.830> blot

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
area than initially with the ink blot

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.650 
area than initially with the ink blot
Theory<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.240> what<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:44.660> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Theory there and what you see and this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.380 
Theory there and what you see and this
is<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> hard<00:02:46.110> part<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.120> like

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
is the hard part you know you just like

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.960 
is the hard part you know you just like
to<00:02:48.570> press<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.930> onto<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> wall<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.950> squash<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to press it onto the wall and squash it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.310 
to press it onto the wall and squash it
around<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.470> remove<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:55.170> have

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
around then you remove it and you have

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.520 
around then you remove it and you have
texture<00:02:56.090> now<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.150> initial<00:02:57.630> idea<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.350> keep

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
texture now the initial idea is to keep

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.270 
texture now the initial idea is to keep
going<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.640> color<00:03:00.020> putting<00:03:01.130> breaking<00:03:02.130> it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
going with one color putting breaking it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.430 
going with one color putting breaking it
into<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.730> areas<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.450> trying<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.990> make<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.200> so

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
into the areas and trying to make it so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.610 
into the areas and trying to make it so
there's<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.740> big<00:03:05.070> blotches<00:03:05.730> everywhere<00:03:06.620> even

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
there's not big blotches everywhere even

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.650 
there's not big blotches everywhere even
if<00:03:07.709> they're<00:03:07.860> arts<00:03:08.130> no<00:03:08.580> big<00:03:08.730> deal<00:03:08.880> textures<00:03:09.360> can

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
if they're arts no big deal textures can

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.810 
if they're arts no big deal textures can
be<00:03:09.870> rectified<00:03:10.470> with<00:03:10.830> more<00:03:11.040> texture<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.700> if

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
be rectified with more texture and if

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.710 
be rectified with more texture and if
you<00:03:11.940> like<00:03:12.440> here's<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.800> lighter<00:03:14.130> texture

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
you like here's the lighter texture

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.320 
you like here's the lighter texture
lighter<00:03:15.720> color<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.350> will<00:03:17.310> put<00:03:17.489> some<00:03:17.790> directly

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
lighter color I will put some directly

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.180 
lighter color I will put some directly
over<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.510> first<00:03:21.780> color<00:03:22.050> just<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.800> see<00:03:23.040> what

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
over the first color just to see what

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.500 
over the first color just to see what
happens<00:03:23.489> with<00:03:23.640> two<00:03:23.820> layers<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> texture

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
happens with two layers of texture

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.910 
happens with two layers of texture
although<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> would<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.200> allowed<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> dry

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
although I would have allowed it to dry

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.970 
although I would have allowed it to dry
in<00:03:26.220> most<00:03:26.970> circumstances<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.989> then<00:03:28.769> let's

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
in most circumstances and then let's

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.009 
in most circumstances and then let's
just<00:03:29.160> see<00:03:29.310> what<00:03:29.430> happens<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.720> lighter

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
just see what happens to have a lighter

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.199 
just see what happens to have a lighter
texture<00:03:31.470> on<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.920> wall<00:03:31.950> versus<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.640> darker

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
texture on the wall versus a darker

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.070 
texture on the wall versus a darker
texture<00:03:33.860> here<00:03:35.209> just<00:03:36.209> squish<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:36.900> around

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
texture here just squish it around

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.100 
texture here just squish it around
sometimes<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.010> get<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> couple<00:03:38.430> prints

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
sometimes you can get a couple prints

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.479 
sometimes you can get a couple prints
it's<00:03:40.110> not<00:03:40.230> much<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.800> very<00:03:40.980> thin<00:03:41.250> glaze

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
it's not much it's a very thin glaze

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.910 
it's not much it's a very thin glaze
there<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.230> some<00:03:43.500> texture

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
there but you can see some texture

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.440 
there but you can see some texture
especially<00:03:45.019> over<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.200> one
