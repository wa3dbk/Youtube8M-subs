00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 save save the station of the episode 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.880
 about the updates are give up this 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
 new good map we already talked about many 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:24.449
 things but now we're going to comment on one 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:25.980
 little about the monsters speak all 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.199
 blacks do not talk first denied 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.449
 docs a new inhabitant of humans said 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 that there is a kiss for those who do not know when 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 the kiss is a crab patrolling there 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.450
 the river 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 on the baron's side and also on the dragon and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.469
 when you do not attack but when 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 You eliminate him, he 's the friend of 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.300
 shrine in front of the dragon's lair 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 where the baron who go by the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 your team gains speed of movement and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 of course it provides some of the insight 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.350
 that area then it ends up being a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.210
 new control point on this map in the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.379
 google docs because if you want to do 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 a dragon though you have to think 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 I looks but quit join live is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.149
 dead is practically the dragon now a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.760
 new goal 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 we can say there with godot certainly 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 esp before we had a priority 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.380
 very high in the dragon with the same game 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.119
 because of the gold that made him that was 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 a significant amount after the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 the end of the departure of the personnel who 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 even a person I 'm just the dragon now 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 Dragon he's no longer the google docs and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 Every time you kill him you win. 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.939
 a buffet then yes the first time is going 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 gain an effect until the door instead 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.509
 arriving the fifth time he triples the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 effects you've already won and he'll give you 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.560
 a bonus that you can cause more 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.229
 damage your basic attacks then 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 basically it will create nox you will 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.780
 have a priority 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.520
 with him from the beginning to the end of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.259
 match because it's okay the first goal 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.729
 may not be as important and the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 but when it gets there 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 pro fifth room you very situations 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040
 required at departure then you will have 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.649
 that keep this control at all times 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.299
 then make exchange I see that even one of the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.159
 moments you get the fifth stec that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.869
 triple the goals of the dragon ends up being 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 more important until the baron a guy 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 Are you talking about Baron? 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.659
 something on him changed his notebook 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 was then altered that regeneration 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 that gave you dhpp demand was very 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.900
 you can even take art a little bit because 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 they did not like little cement then 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.550
 It changes a little hard now 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.979
 he continues to deal 40 damage 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.050
 attack also 40 kind of skill it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.489
 reduces the time of your recall in two 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.680
 seconds then I just got back more 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.720
 quick to base and golf more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.610
 significant is the following whenever 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.890
 your characters from your team and your 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.720
 allies and you have in close 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.550
 and will give a golf depending on the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.260
 kind of me you have not done that reveals 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.819
 many of you on some route 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 the following is interesting and if you 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.560
 is not with 63 5 players of his team 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.959
 or the whole team in case a route the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.239
 boys will have a blow involved in the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.920
 in case it will force you so much to divide 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.420
 your team to improve all your 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.860
 routes improve miners and clear 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.750
 get to take the towers 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.150
 so this is the talk of the four videos 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.640
 about the new updates to itaminas 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.769
 United if you liked it a lot there 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.660
 the one you favorite to share in 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.299
 social networks again thanks to me 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.459
 I was born a con artist and by Diego 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.459
