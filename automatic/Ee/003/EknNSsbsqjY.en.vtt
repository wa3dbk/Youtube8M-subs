00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.380
 Talk to people, beauty today. I'll talk about it. 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 the game that many know as worse 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.580
 games all time this bomb was 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 launched by atari in 1902 by the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.970
 owner 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.680
 in theory the goal of the game is to find 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.170
 the parts of your spaceship and so on 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.489
 Come back home, but it's not like that. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 The way this game is to find it soft and roll 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.720
 a little bit just for you in xerém 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.970
 drama play this thing this fashion 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.350
 of the new graphic so perfect that it is 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.850
 My goodness, they hit the ball for you. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.120
 get out of the hole if it's basically 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.120
 head neck and light tatá 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.470
 ah just so you have an idea of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.759
 success of the game was so much more that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.560
 he was lead 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.899
 responsible for sinking the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.270
 games of the season mainly the fact 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.330
 that the atari that as we fail and creative 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.250
 of the game is lost many millions of 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.110
 dollars with the game what was known 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.729
 like crash of 83 in September in 83 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 a newspaper from New Mexico reported that 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.780
 several semi-trailers carrying 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.460
 texas the coming atari materials had 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.420
 discharged into the landfill 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.220
 municipal 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.350
 in the beginning the company stated that the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 discarding reason was passage of atari 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.399
 2600 for atari 5200 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.310
 but an employee of the 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.649
 late that information at the end 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 of this month to this day and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.600
 of materials atari is one of the most 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.590
 mystery and is considered by some to be 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.209
 urban legend 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.130
 however most people consider 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.830
 this fact as the destruction of about 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.459
 3.5 million copies that were 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.200
 stranded on the sales shelves of ds 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.329
 game that I am showing that is a 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 wonder this game is perfection of 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:19.010
 Gods this is not there, and you? 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.040
 youtube viewer may ask 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.799
 Why do not you, Lucas, why do not I have to judge? 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.609
 this shit before dying 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:32.840

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:35.269
 so you can but play the young pharaoh 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.319
 you have to know how much greed for 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.319
 money takes game companies 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.290
 generated at the time and went into bankruptcy 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.329
 cause this crap that green bug 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.360
 that stretches the neck is rising 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.870
 hole falls into a hole only from 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.870
 new 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.540
 was basically the biggest disappointment of the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 last century in the gaming industry 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.349
 there was no disappointment either 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.019
 that the etr and the atari 2600 and with the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.030
