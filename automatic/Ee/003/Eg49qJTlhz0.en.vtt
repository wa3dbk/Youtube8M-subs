boot again I'm going to bring in the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
boot again I'm going to bring in the
synthetic<00:02:05.969> version<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
synthetic version right here this is the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.859 
synthetic version right here this is the
ombre<00:02:07.799> blue<00:02:08.069> version<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.910> has<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> same<00:02:09.420> GSF

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
ombre blue version this has the same GSF

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.449 
ombre blue version this has the same GSF
in<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> soil<00:02:10.319> play<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> flexes<00:02:11.069> but

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
in the soil play and it flexes but

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
in the soil play and it flexes but
reflects<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.879> lot<00:02:12.180> easier<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.900> that's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
reflects a lot easier and that's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
reflects a lot easier and that's
primarily<00:02:13.770> because<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.400> add<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.610> light

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
primarily because of that add up light

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.400 
primarily because of that add up light
upper<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:17.700> am<00:02:18.120> obviously<00:02:18.630> different<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
upper that's am obviously different to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.300 
upper that's am obviously different to
to<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.830> leather<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.080> can<00:02:22.200> tell<00:02:22.310> give

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to a leather and as you can tell give

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.620 
to a leather and as you can tell give
you<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.460> quick<00:02:23.610> demo<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.240> see<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you a quick demo you can see that it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.670 
you a quick demo you can see that it
kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.840> stretches<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> see<00:02:25.590> that

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
kind of stretches can you see that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.580 
kind of stretches can you see that
material<00:02:26.100> stretching<00:02:26.460> through<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> middle

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
material stretching through the middle

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.080 
material stretching through the middle
so<00:02:28.590> obviously<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.490> be<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so obviously that's not going to be the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.380 
so obviously that's not going to be the
same<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.140> letter<00:02:31.950> version<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.670> mean

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
same in the in the letter version I mean

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.640 
same in the in the letter version I mean
the<00:02:33.480> letter<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.960> stretch<00:02:34.170> over<00:02:34.440> time

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the letter is going to stretch over time

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.290 
the letter is going to stretch over time
but<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.310> give<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.640> same

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
but it's not going to give you that same

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.690 
but it's not going to give you that same
immediate<00:02:36.840> stretch<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.500> that's<00:02:37.650> why<00:02:37.890> GSF

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
immediate stretch and that's why GSF

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.910 
immediate stretch and that's why GSF
system<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.390> place<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:40.740> as

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
system is in place but it's not as

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.140 
system is in place but it's not as
effective<00:02:41.460> in<00:02:41.670> terms<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.030> performance

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150

out<00:02:44.130> i<00:02:44.310> think<00:02:44.760> i<00:02:44.820> prefer<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.150> performance<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
out i think i prefer the performance of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.480 
out i think i prefer the performance of
the<00:02:46.080> synthetic<00:02:46.290> version<00:02:46.890> primarily<00:02:47.310> because

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
the synthetic version primarily because

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.070 
the synthetic version primarily because
the<00:02:47.670> out<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.090> light<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.420> such<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> good

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
the out of light is such a good

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.380 
the out of light is such a good
synthetic<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.610> pretty<00:02:50.790> soft<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
synthetic and it's pretty soft and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.630 
synthetic and it's pretty soft and
supple<00:02:51.570> as<00:02:52.140> i<00:02:52.290> said<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.620> stretches<00:02:53.100> nicely<00:02:53.490> and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
supple as i said it stretches nicely and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.200 
supple as i said it stretches nicely and
it<00:02:53.700> works<00:02:53.880> well<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.330> GSF<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.530> visually

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
it works well with the GSF but visually

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.490 
it works well with the GSF but visually
you<00:02:57.210> cannot<00:02:57.630> beat<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.960> look<00:02:58.110> at<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.290> boot

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
you cannot beat the look at this boot

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.600 
you cannot beat the look at this boot
there's<00:02:58.740> so<00:02:58.950> classic<00:02:59.460> so<00:02:59.760> pristine<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:01.610> like

there's so classic so pristine I like

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.490 
there's so classic so pristine I like

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
system in place it's going to add a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.620 
system in place it's going to add a
little<00:03:21.720> bit<00:03:21.840> extra<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:23.090> durability<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.390> your

little bit extra and durability to your

little bit extra and durability to your
boot<00:03:24.810> keeps<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.680> place<00:03:25.709> add<00:03:26.570> some<00:03:27.570> lateral

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
boot keeps it in place add some lateral

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.820 
boot keeps it in place add some lateral
support<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.250> pretty<00:03:29.370> cool<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:31.650> want<00:03:31.770> to

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
support so it's pretty cool just want to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.500 
support so it's pretty cool just want to

worked on with these was they worked on
a<00:04:09.840> using<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.860> uppers<00:04:11.510> performance<00:04:12.510> for

itself in that you know that tier design

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.560 
itself in that you know that tier design
was<00:04:16.620> what<00:04:16.830> give<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.489> additional<00:04:18.180> element

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
was what give it the additional element

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.000 
was what give it the additional element
rather<00:04:18.780> than<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.019> material<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.620> was<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.890> it

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
rather than the material that was in it

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.700 
rather than the material that was in it
and<00:04:20.160> as<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.910> can<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.090> from<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.810> current

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
and as you can see from this current

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.219 
and as you can see from this current
evopower<00:04:22.979> release<00:04:23.610> again<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:24.810> got<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.110> do

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
evopower release again it's got to do

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.570 
evopower release again it's got to do
with<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:26.280> act

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
with the the act

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.219 
with the the act
form<00:04:26.849> in<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.180> upper<00:04:27.449> along<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> strike<00:04:28.199> zone

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
form in the upper along the strike zone

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.960 
form in the upper along the strike zone
so<00:04:28.590> they're<00:04:28.710> using<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.129> tiered<00:04:29.370> system<00:04:29.610> and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so they're using the tiered system and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.450 
so they're using the tiered system and
are<00:04:30.360> using<00:04:30.569> that<00:04:30.780> paneling<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.039> texture

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
are using that paneling and the texture

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.279 
are using that paneling and the texture
in<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.669> boot<00:04:32.819> rather<00:04:33.569> than<00:04:33.750> bringing<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.139> that

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
in the boot rather than bringing in that

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.469 
in the boot rather than bringing in that
external<00:04:34.740> component<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:36.090> there<00:04:36.270> was<00:04:36.360> any

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
external component so if there was any

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.879 
external component so if there was any
boot<00:04:36.659> that<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:36.870> think<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:37.319> kind<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.680> car

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
boot that I think that this kind of car

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.469 
boot that I think that this kind of car
lates<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.430> even<00:04:39.030> though<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.150> different

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
lates to even though the different

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.209 
lates to even though the different
weight<00:04:39.719> soleplate<00:04:40.259> is<00:04:40.379> different<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.129> know

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
weight soleplate is different you know

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.409 
weight soleplate is different you know
primarily<00:04:41.430> everything<00:04:41.819> is<00:04:41.879> different<00:04:42.120> I

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
primarily everything is different I

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.679 
primarily everything is different I
think<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.469> concept<00:04:44.210> pool<00:04:45.210> has<00:04:45.419> gone<00:04:45.539> back

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
think the concept pool has gone back

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.179 
think the concept pool has gone back
this<00:04:45.930> way<00:04:46.139> this<00:04:46.409> direction<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.889> that's<00:04:47.069> why

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
this way this direction and that's why

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.839 
this way this direction and that's why
they've<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.580> removed<00:04:47.909> the<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.849> power

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
they've kind of removed the the power

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.270 
they've kind of removed the the power
cap<00:04:51.060> which<00:04:51.360> was<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.960> decent<00:04:52.560> release<00:04:52.979> but

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
cap which was a decent release but

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.070 
cap which was a decent release but
overall<00:04:53.669> not<00:04:54.000> as<00:04:54.979> widely<00:04:55.979> regarded<00:04:56.310> as<00:04:56.819> the

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
overall not as widely regarded as the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.610 
overall not as widely regarded as the
original<00:04:58.080> powercat<00:04:58.469> released<00:05:00.289> so<00:05:01.289> there<00:05:01.469> you

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
original powercat released so there you

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.040 
original powercat released so there you
have<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:02.759> finish<00:05:03.030> up<00:05:03.180> guys<00:05:03.360> please<00:05:03.780> leave

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
have it to finish up guys please leave

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.480 
have it to finish up guys please leave

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.640 
me a comment down below tell me what you
think<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.729> this<00:05:05.879> blackout<00:05:06.330> design<00:05:06.780> do<00:05:07.590> you

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
think of this blackout design do you

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.110 
think of this blackout design do you
like<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.949> fact<00:05:08.129> that<00:05:08.219> Puma<00:05:08.490> has<00:05:08.580> not<00:05:08.789> left<00:05:09.000> any

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
like the fact that Puma has not left any

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.899 
like the fact that Puma has not left any
markings<00:05:09.659> on<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.990> boot<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.610> which<00:05:11.610> version

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
markings on the boot and which version

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.909 
markings on the boot and which version
would<00:05:11.969> you<00:05:12.060> prefer<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:12.419> synthetic<00:05:12.750> or<00:05:13.530> the
