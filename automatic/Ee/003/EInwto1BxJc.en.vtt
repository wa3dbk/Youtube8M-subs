00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.470 

I<00:00:39.370> think<00:00:40.370> for<00:00:40.520> me<00:00:40.550> what<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.880> really<00:00:41.240> enjoy<00:00:41.270> about

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
I think for me what I really enjoy about

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.900 
I think for me what I really enjoy about
dirt<00:00:42.050> compare<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.650> tarmac<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.340> just<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> fact

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
dirt compare the tarmac is just the fact

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.090 
dirt compare the tarmac is just the fact
that<00:00:44.090> there's<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.140> many<00:00:45.230> different<00:00:45.770> ways<00:00:45.980> to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
that there's so many different ways to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.190 
that there's so many different ways to
get<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.730> corner<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.360> there's<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.080> many

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
get to a corner and there's so many

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.350 
get to a corner and there's so many
different<00:00:48.470> traction<00:00:49.070> levels<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.610> just<00:00:50.150> makes

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
different traction levels it just makes

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.040 
different traction levels it just makes
it<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.750> more<00:00:51.020> dynamic<00:00:51.380> surface<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.460> race<00:00:52.700> on

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
it a more dynamic surface to race on

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.140 
it a more dynamic surface to race on
because<00:00:54.050> there's<00:00:54.890> different<00:00:55.340> ways<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.940> the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
because there's different ways that the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.479 
because there's different ways that the
brake<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.840> power<00:00:57.440> through<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.890> corner<00:00:58.280> and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
brake and power through the corner and

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.060 
brake and power through the corner and
exit<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.330> corner<00:00:59.840> it<00:01:00.290> just<00:01:00.530> gives<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.860> more

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
exit the corner it just gives you more

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.040 
exit the corner it just gives you more
of<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.190> variety<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.850> ways<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.210> play<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.840> game

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
of a variety of ways to play the game

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:19.650 
of a variety of ways to play the game
and<00:01:03.320> that's<00:01:03.470> what<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.800> really<00:01:04.070> enjoy

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.910 

well<00:01:20.660> some<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:20.990> stage<00:01:21.230> is<00:01:21.410> in<00:01:21.560> there<00:01:21.710> to

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
well some of the stage is in there to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.010 
well some of the stage is in there to
have<00:01:22.540> mixed<00:01:23.540> surfaces<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:26.300> know<00:01:26.420> such<00:01:26.720> as<00:01:26.870> the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
have mixed surfaces you know such as the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.400 
have mixed surfaces you know such as the
Battersea<00:01:27.530> stage<00:01:28.430> where<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.170> jumping<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
Battersea stage where you jumping in and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.460 
Battersea stage where you jumping in and
out<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.640> building<00:01:31.850> itself<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.870> once<00:01:33.350> you

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
out of the building itself and once you

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.200 
out of the building itself and once you
get<00:01:33.650> out<00:01:33.800> there's<00:01:34.040> some<00:01:34.220> tarmac<00:01:34.640> areas<00:01:35.030> and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
get out there's some tarmac areas and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.550 
get out there's some tarmac areas and
there's<00:01:35.420> some<00:01:35.570> good<00:01:35.750> areas<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.380> there's

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
there's some good areas and there's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.880 
there's some good areas and there's
jumps<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.150> really<00:01:38.390> got<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.570> notice<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
jumps and you really got a notice the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.680 
jumps and you really got a notice the
ground<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.670> dirts<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.150> because<00:01:41.540> of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
ground that the dirts on because of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.840 
ground that the dirts on because of
traction<00:01:42.020> varies<00:01:42.830> according<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.520> surface

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
traction varies according to the surface

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.060 
traction varies according to the surface
so<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:44.810> areas<00:01:45.170> where<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> car<00:01:45.710> will<00:01:45.890> have

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
so there's areas where the car will have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.030 
so there's areas where the car will have
a<00:01:46.250> better<00:01:46.670> grip<00:01:47.060> once<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.170> tarmac<00:01:48.680> areas

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
a better grip once in the tarmac areas

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.980 
a better grip once in the tarmac areas
and<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.850> also<00:01:50.060> those<00:01:50.420> other<00:01:50.630> areas<00:01:50.960> where

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and then also those other areas where

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.110 
and then also those other areas where
the<00:01:51.320> car<00:01:51.530> will<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.890> slide<00:01:52.160> more<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.729> think

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
the car will just slide more I think

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.550 
the car will just slide more I think
that's<00:01:53.270> amazing<00:01:53.720> there's<00:01:53.930> definitely<00:01:54.350> some

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
that's amazing there's definitely some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.110 
that's amazing there's definitely some
stages<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.400> here<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:55.670> America

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
stages that we have here in America

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.090 
stages that we have here in America
where<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:57.050> know<00:01:57.200> you're<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.530> mix<00:01:57.830> of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
where you know you're on the mix of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.250 
where you know you're on the mix of
tarmac<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.390> then<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.600> changes<00:02:00.020> over<00:02:00.229> the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
tarmac and then the changes over the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.719 
tarmac and then the changes over the
dirt<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.280> able<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.610> identify

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
dirt and you have to be able to identify

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.719 
dirt and you have to be able to identify
those<00:02:02.390> areas<00:02:02.630> obviously<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:04.070> your<00:02:04.220> eyes<00:02:04.370> and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
those areas obviously with your eyes and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.460 
those areas obviously with your eyes and
adjust<00:02:05.090> your<00:02:05.240> driving<00:02:05.630> style<00:02:05.750> according<00:02:06.350> to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
adjust your driving style according to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.080 
adjust your driving style according to
the<00:02:06.590> surface<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:07.070> you're<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.880> same

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the surface that you're on the same

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:24.950 
the surface that you're on the same
thing<00:02:08.330> here

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.070 

thank<00:02:25.200> God

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.949 

there's<00:02:29.080> always<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.530> fine<00:02:29.950> balance<00:02:30.220> between

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
there's always a fine balance between

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.720 
there's always a fine balance between
too<00:02:31.959> much<00:02:31.990> steering<00:02:32.590> input<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.100> too<00:02:33.250> much<00:02:33.400> gas

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
too much steering input or too much gas

you can and occasionally that will put
you<00:02:42.400> off<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.550> road<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.770> that's<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.280> know

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
you off the road but that's you know

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.010 
you off the road but that's you know
part<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.730> farming<00:02:46.000> part<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> challenge<00:02:46.900> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
part of farming part of a challenge is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.949 
part of farming part of a challenge is
really<00:02:47.140> figuring<00:02:47.800> out<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:49.209> sensitivity<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
really figuring out the sensitivity of

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.540 
really figuring out the sensitivity of
the<00:02:50.080> controller<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.770> sensitivity<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the controller the sensitivity of the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.120 
the controller the sensitivity of the
car<00:02:51.820> how<00:02:52.630> much<00:02:52.780> feedback<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.560> really<00:02:53.830> get

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
car how much feedback you really get

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.250 
car how much feedback you really get
from<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.610> car<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.150> way<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.600> moves<00:02:55.900> on

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
from the car the way that it moves on

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.199
