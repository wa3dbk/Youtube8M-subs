00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 different kinds of pokemon I would 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 I mean the second and good third 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.420
 generation of pokemon is really will be 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 pokémons that are worth it is more when 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 you had a dragon there in your oil 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.930
 yellow red version 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 the dirt would be removed looking for the 150 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 malito because monde besides having 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.110

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 other pana yours and profiles there we can 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 have the three initial pokemones and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.329
 its maximum evolutions after having 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.649
 past the pokemon league was how to win 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.090
 Latin that they dropped from Peru 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.769
 lottery of your country but now 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.380
 and many gamers must be happy 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 because this other series of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850
 poems more based on the manga that has 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.890
 returned as life does not line it to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.450
 pokemon and it gives more coherence with the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 emb game today I know that all the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 anime fans but now that in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.300
 this trip today I want to express myself because 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.950
 only times so like in this 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.310

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310
 I like it 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.070
 such 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.130
 it seems as if the creators had 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.810
 been kidnapped and replaced by 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.810
 Zumba and the one who does not know who is a bar 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.510

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.070
 going straight next to my head the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.520
 creative process of how to make new 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.820
 pokémon is that good if we're going to grab 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.300
 an unworthy animal like a pretty 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.310
 corner 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.619

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.050
