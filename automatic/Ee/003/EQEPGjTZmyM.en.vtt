what I'm gonna go to the dance game so I

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.420 
what I'm gonna go to the dance game so I
could<00:03:42.630> fail<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.260> then<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:46.859> feed<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430

could fail it and then you know feed it
feeding<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.030> won't<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.269> make<00:03:48.420> a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
feeding it won't really make a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.059 
feeding it won't really make a
difference<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:49.049> even<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.650> do<00:03:49.709> play<00:03:49.920> the

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
difference because even if I do play the
