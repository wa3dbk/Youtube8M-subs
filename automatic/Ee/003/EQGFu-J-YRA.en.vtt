they<00:01:19.960> come<00:01:20.229> back<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:20.979> talk<00:01:21.130> about<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.430> couple

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
they come back and talk about a couple

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.969 
they come back and talk about a couple
of<00:01:21.820> specific<00:01:22.000> teaching<00:01:22.630> points<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.860> then

a<00:05:53.210> little<00:05:53.479> bit<00:05:53.599> with<00:05:53.720> performing<00:05:54.260> this

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
a little bit with performing this

a little bit with performing this
movement

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
movement

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.920 
movement
first<00:05:55.700> one<00:05:55.910> is<00:05:56.030> like<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.389> talked<00:05:56.599> about<00:05:56.690> in<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
first one is like I talked about in the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.020 
first one is like I talked about in the
beginning<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.620> start<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.979> say<00:05:58.190> or<00:05:58.580> doing<00:05:58.880> this

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
beginning you start to say or doing this

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.760 
beginning you start to say or doing this
type<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.300> thing<00:05:59.450> here<00:05:59.960> which<00:06:00.410> ultimately

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
type of thing here which ultimately

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.330 
type of thing here which ultimately
leads<00:06:01.400> into<00:06:01.580> a<00:06:01.729> shoving<00:06:02.349> our<00:06:03.349> upper<00:06:03.740> back<00:06:03.919> into

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
leads into a shoving our upper back into

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.480 
leads into a shoving our upper back into
our<00:06:04.460> neck<00:06:04.669> area<00:06:04.940> not<00:06:05.330> comfortable<00:06:06.050> not<00:06:06.860> not

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
our neck area not comfortable not not

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.029 
our neck area not comfortable not not
comfortable<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.270> potentially<00:06:09.169> gives<00:06:09.680> us<00:06:09.830> not

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
comfortable and potentially gives us not

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.770 
comfortable and potentially gives us not
only<00:06:10.130> a<00:06:10.250> bad<00:06:10.460> movement<00:06:10.940> pattern<00:06:11.330> but<00:06:11.630> also

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
only a bad movement pattern but also

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.629 
only a bad movement pattern but also
gives<00:06:12.169> us

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
gives us

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.270 
gives us
some<00:06:12.849> chinks<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.330> somebody<00:06:13.629> some<00:06:14.530> trigger

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
some chinks and somebody some trigger

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.649 
some chinks and somebody some trigger
points<00:06:15.669> in<00:06:15.729> our<00:06:15.849> upper<00:06:16.060> back

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
points in our upper back

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.679 
points in our upper back
so<00:06:16.930> again<00:06:17.939> push-ups<00:06:18.939> and<00:06:19.060> any<00:06:19.180> kind<00:06:19.389> of<00:06:19.419> press

so again push-ups and any kind of press
either<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.169> as<00:06:20.289> much<00:06:20.469> about<00:06:20.620> back<00:06:21.159> as<00:06:21.430> they

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
either just as much about back as they

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.700 
either just as much about back as they
are<00:06:21.699> about<00:06:21.819> the<00:06:22.090> actual<00:06:22.419> movies<00:06:23.110> be<00:06:23.289> performed

are about the actual movies be performed
our<00:06:24.039> back<00:06:24.310> is<00:06:24.550> critical<00:06:25.029> here<00:06:25.060> pulling<00:06:25.599> our

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:25.749 
our back is critical here pulling our

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:28.019 
our back is critical here pulling our
chest<00:06:26.020> tall<00:06:26.289> holding<00:06:26.979> a<00:06:27.069> good<00:06:27.249> posture<00:06:27.550> and

chest tall holding a good posture and

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:33.089 
chest tall holding a good posture and
allowing<00:06:29.020> our<00:06:31.110> upper<00:06:32.110> body<00:06:32.319> do<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.710> work<00:06:32.770> that

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
allowing our upper body do the work that

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.390 
allowing our upper body do the work that
would<00:06:33.189> manually<00:06:34.379> another<00:06:35.379> key<00:06:35.680> that<00:06:35.889> I<00:06:36.009> think

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
would manually another key that I think

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.550 
would manually another key that I think
are<00:06:36.550> coaching<00:06:36.999> to<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.330> life<00:06:37.479> used<00:06:37.840> for<00:06:38.349> those

are coaching to the life used for those
that<00:06:38.830> aren't<00:06:39.099> accustomed<00:06:39.610> to<00:06:39.729> doing<00:06:39.879> push-ups
