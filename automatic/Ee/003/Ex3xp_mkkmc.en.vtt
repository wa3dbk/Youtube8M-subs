00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 5th match and first big test for 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 the french team the experts want 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 make sure they are in first place 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.830
 group and especially marked the spirits 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.840
 facing a young German team but 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.580
 talented the Germans very good in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.289
 the offensive sector is leading the hard way 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 French for a quarter of an hour he 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 inflicts cac40 to France but the double 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 titleholder reacts the French 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.880
 pass by and even take two 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.660
 goals of advanced after this shot from nikola 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.670
 Karabatic 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.109
 but everything is not settled and germany 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.000
 regularly manages to take the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.739
 better on the French defense 16 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.920
 everywhere at half-time match under high 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.920
 voltage 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.980
 we did a bad half year 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.410
 still still tied to score so that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.590
 means that here we come to settle a 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.510
 little embarrassed defensive player relationship 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.280
 we immediately traded lassana 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.260
 on the match and hull started at them 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.880
 to doubt the return of the locker room 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.920
 is complicated for the experts who 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
 cash a 3-0 concluded by as 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.050
 and if the French offers us some 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.490
 fulgurances germany continues on its 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.800
 launched + 5 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.369
 after this goal signed groetzki he remains a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.369
 quarter of an hour to play 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.860
 the entry into play of william accambray 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.450
 is good for world champions but 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.570
 there are too many opportunities to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.190
 get closer and then they come back to 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.259
 contact under the impulse of a 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.330
 awesome nikola karabatic 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.550
 they will spoil the last opportunity 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.060
 to equalize christopher's attention 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.060
 sympathy 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.960
 does daouda karaboue and what 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.640
 bad raise 32-30 final score 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.360
 beaten by a beautiful team from germany 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.850
 France finishes second in her group 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's not worrying yeah I saw on 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.039
 our competitions we saw last 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.799
 Olympic Games I knew that the phases 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.340
 group was not a part 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.310
 fundamental 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.350
 we have a team 3rd round where to go in 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.860
 final and we won second 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.110
 here is after it is more silent 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.519
 found sails to find 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.769
 face to face sensations at a big 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.690
 team we see this happens and we go 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.220
 not going to dwell on it 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 analyze well we will especially qualify 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 for the knockout stage we are 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.920
 qualified and now it's another 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.260
 companion that starts and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.239
 here is to use this defeat for 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.909
 to draw more motivation in the end 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.360
 of year we had a balloon for 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:35.780
 maybe hope to make a deserved draw 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.540
 but negotiate and now that's it 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.099
 maybe the hard and the decisive what to 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.290
 from now on this is going to be a 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.670
 match to win all the time moment everything 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.440
 so what's the attention because 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.670
 that you have to tear yourself out there 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.989
 frankly we are nothing regrettable 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.069
 because regrets his chances what 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.069
 are the games will be present m 10
