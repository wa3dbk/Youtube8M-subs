00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
I do think the here a little bit it's a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.659 
I do think the here a little bit it's a
little<00:03:48.450> bit<00:03:48.690> too<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:49.349> tattoo<00:03:49.650> bulb<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
little bit too little tattoo bulb it

little bit too little tattoo bulb it
looks<00:03:51.000> alright<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.599> think<00:03:51.780> here<00:03:52.290> on<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.500> hand

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
looks alright I think here on the hand

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.170 
looks alright I think here on the hand
grip<00:03:52.859> maybe<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.519> waffle<00:03:54.030> pattern

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
grip maybe because of the waffle pattern

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.960 
grip maybe because of the waffle pattern
that<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:54.989> use<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.799> on<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.069> stock<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.639> think

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
that they use but on the stock I think

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.729 
that they use but on the stock I think
that<00:03:57.090> maybe<00:03:57.329> I'm<00:03:57.599> going<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> take<00:03:57.989> my<00:03:58.380> for

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
that maybe I'm going to take my for

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.819 
that maybe I'm going to take my for

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.120 
have done that but now my choices here
are<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.889> do<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.940> handle<00:04:55.479> in<00:04:55.740> tiger<00:04:56.740> stripe<00:04:56.979> and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
are to do the handle in tiger stripe and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.230 
are to do the handle in tiger stripe and
then<00:04:57.250> be<00:04:57.370> done<00:04:57.400> with<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.789> which<00:04:57.940> i<00:04:58.000> think<00:04:58.060> i

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
then be done with it which i think i

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.939 
then be done with it which i think i
might<00:04:58.360> do<00:04:58.539> but<00:04:58.720> another<00:04:58.840> idea<00:04:59.110> that<00:04:59.169> i<00:04:59.259> had<00:04:59.470> you

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
might do but another idea that i had you

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.140 
might do but another idea that i had you
know<00:05:00.070> maybe<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.340> want<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.580> do<00:05:00.639> is<00:05:00.789> obviously

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
know maybe you want to do is obviously

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.730 
know maybe you want to do is obviously
the<00:05:01.240> armalite<00:05:01.690> bodies<00:05:02.080> have<00:05:02.259> a<00:05:02.289> two-part

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
the armalite bodies have a two-part

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.070 
the armalite bodies have a two-part
receiver<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.849> unfolds<00:05:04.630> i<00:05:04.720> was<00:05:04.840> thinking

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
receiver that unfolds i was thinking

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.990 
receiver that unfolds i was thinking
about<00:05:05.199> doing<00:05:05.259> the<00:05:05.530> top<00:05:05.770> receiver<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.580> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
about doing the top receiver and the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.200 
about doing the top receiver and the
magazine<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:07.870> camouflage<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.759> then<00:05:09.970> leaving

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
magazine in camouflage and then leaving

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.710 
magazine in camouflage and then leaving
the<00:05:10.449> lower<00:05:10.599> receiver<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.289> handle<00:05:11.830> in<00:05:12.720> regular

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720
