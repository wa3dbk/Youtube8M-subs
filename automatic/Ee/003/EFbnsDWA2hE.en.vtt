00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
of Nova and then here's the back of the

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.800 
of Nova and then here's the back of the
packaging<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.009> you<00:02:03.069> can<00:02:03.310> kind<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.670> see

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
packaging and so you can kind of see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.359 
packaging and so you can kind of see
it's<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.869> same<00:02:04.899> thing<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.560> shows<00:02:05.709> that<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
it's the same thing it shows that the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.880 
it's the same thing it shows that the
bill<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.700> figure<00:02:06.999> parts<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:07.780> who<00:02:08.410> each<00:02:08.590> one

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
bill to figure parts and who each one

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.980 
bill to figure parts and who each one
goes<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.190> notice<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.240> there's<00:02:10.390> no<00:02:10.539> variance

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
goes to notice that there's no variance

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.530 
goes to notice that there's no variance
in<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:11.350> wave<00:02:12.130> I'm<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.180> assume<00:02:13.480> that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
in this wave I'm going to assume that

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.890 
in this wave I'm going to assume that
this<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:15.190> wave<00:02:15.430> only<00:02:15.880> I'm<00:02:16.120> bet<00:02:16.660> we're

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
this is a one wave only I'm bet we're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530 
this is a one wave only I'm bet we're
not<00:02:17.050> going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> see<00:02:17.470> any<00:02:17.650> additional<00:02:18.300> waves<00:02:19.300> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
not going to see any additional waves of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.900 
not going to see any additional waves of
this<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.260> know<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.400> guardians<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
this you know of the guardians of the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.170 
this you know of the guardians of the
galaxy

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
galaxy

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.110 
galaxy
but<00:02:23.569> maybe<00:02:24.079> they<00:02:24.230> maybe<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.799> could<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
but maybe they maybe we could but I just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.580 
but maybe they maybe we could but I just
have<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.239> feeling<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:26.959> going<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.379> be

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
have a feeling that this is going to be

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.429 
have a feeling that this is going to be
a<00:02:27.620> one-off<00:02:28.239> type<00:02:29.239> thing<00:02:31.180> Nova<00:02:32.180> has<00:02:32.329> a<00:02:32.439> his

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
a one-off type thing Nova has a his

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.289 
a one-off type thing Nova has a his
little<00:02:33.680> bio<00:02:33.799> on<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.159> back<00:02:34.340> go<00:02:34.849> ahead<00:02:35.060> and

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
little bio on the back go ahead and

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.880 
little bio on the back go ahead and
pause<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.959> now<00:02:36.049> if<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.230> guys<00:02:36.379> want<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.709> take<00:02:36.829> it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
pause it now if you guys want to take it

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.490 
pause it now if you guys want to take it
take<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.640> look<00:02:37.849> at<00:02:37.909> this<00:02:37.969> and<00:02:38.150> read<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.500> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
take a look at this and read it so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500 
take a look at this and read it so
overall<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.920> mean<00:02:40.219> I<00:02:40.459> think<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.879> packaging<00:02:41.389> on

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
overall I mean I think the packaging on

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.990 
overall I mean I think the packaging on
these<00:02:41.689> are<00:02:41.840> great<00:02:42.189> you<00:02:43.189> know<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.400> find<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.909> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
these are great you know I do find it a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.280 
these are great you know I do find it a
little<00:02:44.150> interesting<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.870> know<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.079> hasbro

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
little interesting you know that hasbro

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.349 
little interesting you know that hasbro
continues<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.129> talk<00:02:46.280> about<00:02:46.310> cutting<00:02:47.030> costs

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
continues to talk about cutting costs

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.709 
continues to talk about cutting costs
and<00:02:48.549> then<00:02:49.549> they<00:02:49.670> give<00:02:49.819> us<00:02:49.969> these<00:02:50.120> packaging

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.719 
and then they give us these packaging

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.259 
and then they give us these packaging
like<00:02:51.469> this<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:52.040> don't<00:02:52.549> know<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.969> me<00:02:53.090> these

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
like this I don't know to me these

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.509 
like this I don't know to me these
packaging<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:54.319> these<00:02:54.769> type<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.040> package

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
packaging this these type of package

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.270 
packaging this these type of package
seem<00:02:56.419> like<00:02:56.689> they're<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.349> little<00:02:57.560> overkill<00:02:58.069> I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
seem like they're a little overkill I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.069 
seem like they're a little overkill I
mean<00:02:58.730> they<00:02:58.879> they<00:02:59.120> seem<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.689> they're<00:02:59.870> geared

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
mean they they seem that they're geared

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.360 
mean they they seem that they're geared
toward<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.470> collector<00:03:00.799> market<00:03:00.919> and<00:03:01.280> people

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
toward the collector market and people

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.640 
toward the collector market and people
lots<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.269> people<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.629> are<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.439> know<00:03:03.500> the

lots of people that are and you know the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.839 
lots of people that are and you know the
collector<00:03:03.919> market<00:03:04.040> who<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.519> keep<00:03:04.730> them

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
in our card they kind of go for this but

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.909

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
cutting prices I to me I just feel like

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.959 
cutting prices I to me I just feel like
these<00:03:11.930> boxes<00:03:12.439> are<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.620> little<00:03:12.829> overkill<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.639> mean

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
these boxes are a little overkill I mean

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:15.159 
these boxes are a little overkill I mean
what<00:03:14.090> do<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.239> guys<00:03:14.329> think<00:03:14.389> you<00:03:14.750> guys<00:03:14.900> think

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
what do you guys think you guys think

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:16.780 
what do you guys think you guys think
these<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.409> overkill<00:03:15.799> alright<00:03:16.459> let's<00:03:16.639> crack

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
these are overkill alright let's crack

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
these are overkill alright let's crack
this<00:03:16.819> guy<00:03:17.120> open<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.870> take<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.079> look<00:03:18.230> at<00:03:18.379> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this guy open and take a look at the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.159 
this guy open and take a look at the
figure<00:03:18.739> itself<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.480> quick<00:03:20.840> look<00:03:21.019> at<00:03:21.139> the

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
figure itself just a quick look at the

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.250 
figure itself just a quick look at the
instructions<00:03:22.120> manual<00:03:23.120> it's<00:03:23.930> pretty<00:03:24.079> neat

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
instructions manual it's pretty neat

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.679 
instructions manual it's pretty neat
that<00:03:24.439> usually<00:03:25.430> these<00:03:25.549> are<00:03:25.730> pretty<00:03:25.969> kind<00:03:26.599> of

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
that usually these are pretty kind of

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.330 
that usually these are pretty kind of
standard<00:03:27.109> but<00:03:27.349> notice<00:03:27.919> how<00:03:27.949> this<00:03:28.159> one

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
standard but notice how this one

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.869 
standard but notice how this one
actually<00:03:28.489> has<00:03:28.729> the<00:03:28.879> marvels<00:03:29.449> Nova<00:03:29.870> checked<00:03:30.879> so

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
actually has the marvels Nova checked so

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.789 
actually has the marvels Nova checked so
I'm<00:03:32.629> assuming<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.229> haven't<00:03:33.470> looked<00:03:33.590> at<00:03:33.680> the

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
I'm assuming I haven't looked at the

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.280 
I'm assuming I haven't looked at the
other<00:03:33.949> figures<00:03:34.280> yet<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:34.669> each<00:03:34.879> figure<00:03:35.389> must

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
other figures yet but each figure must

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.469 
other figures yet but each figure must
have<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:37.129> its<00:03:37.280> own<00:03:37.489> little<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:38.359> know

way<00:06:00.050> he<00:06:00.170> looks<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.650> haven't<00:06:01.370> decided<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.850> I'll

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
way he looks I haven't decided if I'll

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.840 
way he looks I haven't decided if I'll
keep<00:06:02.270> them<00:06:02.420> or<00:06:02.570> not<00:06:02.690> but<00:06:03.080> we'll<00:06:03.560> see<00:06:04.490> down<00:06:04.700> the

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
keep them or not but we'll see down the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.210 
keep them or not but we'll see down the
road<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.660> here's<00:06:06.170> just<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.650> quick<00:06:07.010> size

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
road and here's just a quick size

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.360 
road and here's just a quick size
comparison<00:06:07.880> you<00:06:08.690> can<00:06:08.720> see<00:06:09.140> that<00:06:09.370> he's

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
comparison you can see that he's

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.790 
comparison you can see that he's
basically<00:06:11.000> he's<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:11.840> he's<00:06:12.290> actually<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.680> little

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
basically he's a he's actually a little

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.200 
basically he's a he's actually a little
shorter<00:06:13.400> than<00:06:14.000> black<00:06:14.270> cat<00:06:14.620> that's<00:06:15.620> kind<00:06:15.950> of

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
shorter than black cat that's kind of

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.790 
shorter than black cat that's kind of
that<00:06:17.210> that<00:06:17.570> makes<00:06:17.810> him<00:06:17.990> feel<00:06:18.170> a<00:06:18.230> little<00:06:18.470> sad<00:06:18.740> I

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
that that makes him feel a little sad I

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.520 
that that makes him feel a little sad I
think<00:06:19.250> makes<00:06:20.000> them<00:06:20.150> you<00:06:20.720> know<00:06:20.810> kind<00:06:21.110> of<00:06:21.170> less

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
think makes them you know kind of less

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.470 
think makes them you know kind of less
is<00:06:21.770> that<00:06:21.890> make<00:06:22.040> him<00:06:22.160> less<00:06:22.310> of<00:06:22.490> a<00:06:22.580> man<00:06:22.730> I<00:06:22.970> don't

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
is that make him less of a man I don't

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.630 
is that make him less of a man I don't
know<00:06:23.570> he<00:06:23.870> is<00:06:24.200> taller<00:06:24.470> than<00:06:24.590> Jean<00:06:24.920> Grey<00:06:25.130> you<00:06:25.490> can

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.980 
know he is taller than Jean Grey you can
give<00:06:25.760> her<00:06:25.880> that<00:06:26.000> much<00:06:26.180> oh<00:06:26.330> wait<00:06:26.540> they're
