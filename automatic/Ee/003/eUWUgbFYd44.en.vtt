writing a forum and genomic asked the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.909 
writing a forum and genomic asked the
question<00:00:21.520> if<00:00:21.669> it's<00:00:21.849> possible<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> ballet

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
question if it's possible to do a ballet

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:35.709 
question if it's possible to do a ballet
in<00:00:24.340> this<00:00:24.550> kind<00:00:24.910> of<00:00:25.060> form

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.950 

this<00:00:37.160> project<00:00:38.160> itself<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.570> done

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this project itself it can be just done

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.680 
this project itself it can be just done
by<00:00:40.379> people<00:00:40.920> who<00:00:41.309> understands<00:00:41.970> themselves

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
by people who understands themselves

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.799 
by people who understands themselves
quite<00:00:42.989> well<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:44.070> eventually<00:00:44.699> work<00:00:45.210> parallel

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
quite well we eventually work parallel

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.390 
quite well we eventually work parallel
because<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:48.600> never<00:00:48.930> enough<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:50.100> doing

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
because it's never enough time for doing

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700 
because it's never enough time for doing
something<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:51.690> didn't<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.409> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
something and we actually didn't see for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.450 
something and we actually didn't see for
quite<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> long<00:00:53.250> time<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> work<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.339> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
quite a long time the work from the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
quite a long time the work from the
other

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.620 

and<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.270> idea<00:01:19.420> was<00:01:19.719> actually<00:01:20.109> to<00:01:20.439> be<00:01:20.950> also

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and the idea was actually to be also

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.559 
and the idea was actually to be also
inspired<00:01:22.630> from<00:01:23.049> his<00:01:23.369> blocks<00:01:24.369> which<00:01:24.789> he<00:01:25.359> has

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
inspired from his blocks which he has

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:31.109 
inspired from his blocks which he has
done<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.289> was<00:01:29.770> trying<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.130> make<00:01:30.250> myself<00:01:30.729> more

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
done so I was trying to make myself more

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.529 
done so I was trying to make myself more
flexible<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:32.250> any<00:01:33.250> case<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
flexible in any case and in the

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.240 
flexible in any case and in the
beginning<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:35.020> course<00:01:35.289> we<00:01:35.560> didn't<00:01:35.890> know<00:01:36.009> which

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
beginning of course we didn't know which

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:50.410 
beginning of course we didn't know which
music<00:01:37.119> we<00:01:37.299> will<00:01:37.509> get<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:38.170> choreograph

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.539 

our<00:01:51.420> situation<00:01:52.970> we<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.299> started<00:01:54.810> separately

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
our situation we we started separately

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.499 
our situation we we started separately
after<00:01:56.549> John<00:01:57.090> divided<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> music<00:02:00.299> which

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
after John divided like the music which

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.919 
after John divided like the music which
has<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.039> has<00:02:02.729> Bo<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> whole

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
has like which has Bo for the whole

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.819 
has like which has Bo for the whole
evening<00:02:04.159> where<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.460> having<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:07.409> 20

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
evening where we are having like 20

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.110 
evening where we are having like 20
blocks<00:02:08.599> not<00:02:09.599> necessarily<00:02:10.380> like<00:02:10.819> from<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
blocks not necessarily like from the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.930 
blocks not necessarily like from the
beginning<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> music<00:02:13.620> piece<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> end

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
from the colors on we also thought in

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.780 
from the colors on we also thought in
the<00:04:18.530> beginning<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:19.100> will<00:04:19.310> be<00:04:19.520> already<00:04:21.790> very

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
the beginning it will be already very

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.270 
the beginning it will be already very
colorful<00:04:23.690> because<00:04:24.230> of<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.650> changes<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.550> then

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
colorful because of the changes and then

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.550 
colorful because of the changes and then
and<00:04:26.420> we<00:04:27.420> had<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.780> find<00:04:28.020> like<00:04:28.320> quiet<00:04:29.930> all<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.290> I

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
and we had to find like quiet all and I

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.770 
and we had to find like quiet all and I
think<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.280> that's<00:04:32.430> why<00:04:32.760> we<00:04:32.940> decided<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.600> have

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
think that that's why we decided to have

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.110 
think that that's why we decided to have
just<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.610> limited<00:04:36.180> amount<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.380> colors<00:04:37.860> and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
just like a limited amount of colors and
