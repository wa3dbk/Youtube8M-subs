00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 yes hello people in this video look 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.980
 Let's have a panzerglas foley for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.400
 the ipad and ipad 2 from the company claas 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.620
 on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.019
 In the end could also be one of these 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.099
 But films win more after the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.099
 intro have fun 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.570
 The tank glass screen protector comes 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.220
 this chic packaging if we 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.110
 We can open these on the one hand 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.939
 page the instructions and the bill 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.970
 and on the other side 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.160
 is next to the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.020
 screen protector as well as the whole 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.120
 accessory products to attach the foil 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.699
 the happy then something protected 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.980
 such a black packaging and still 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.720
 additionally in such a kind of pad 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.059
 Packing with the transport 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.010
 not to break then we have here 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.019
 still this little packet with the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.750
 mounting accessories we have one then 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.180
 microfiber cleaning cloth in it an alcohol 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.699
 soaked towel and two adhesive strips 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.949
 to clear the dust on the display too 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.650
 remove and last but not least we have 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.229
 Yet a little map from plastic to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.820
 to remove bubbles before we take the film 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.640
 we need to attach the display as 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.170
 first clean with the microfiber cloth 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.630
 and then we can do that in 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.909
 take alcohol- soaked cloth and with 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.280
 This again , the display 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.900
 clean if, for example, contamination by 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.969
 greasy fingers or just stop 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.950
 get away fingerprints 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.500
 Now we can still use the shamrock 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 remove the last dust grains provided 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.189
 which are still available then you can 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.740
 now already at the classe politique 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.689
 remove this little protective film with 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 the lax up here and now it has to 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.390
 whole just just right 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.250
 become 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.740
 I'm here at home 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.450
 button oriented and the case now 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.759
 but a few bubbles are present 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890
 we can put it out to the edge 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.960
 with the help of this little transparent 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.909
 patch if you have the foil now 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 first not even brought perfectly to 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.840
 you can have them again 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 remove and bring a second time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.070
 however, that should not be too often 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.869
 Do what we do with the panzerglas foley 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.939
 very much like that the display 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.150
 really completely protected and 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.970
 no place remains free with 0.3 mm 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.340
 is now wearing something I think 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.500
 that it is not particularly disturbing 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.600
 to be relative after only a short time 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.069
 quickly got used to it 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.410
 all now at the home button because of the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.730
 something deeper but that bothers 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.980
 actually not 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.840
 even the edges of the read aloud 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 rounded so the film has no 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.159
 unpleasant edges now definitely comes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.880
 the question on what can the film so 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.490
 everything and 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.430
 rome on a tablet so the slide serves 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.980
 to do this when your tablet display is flying 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.990
 protects the glass film of this 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.180
 Further, the film also ensures that 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.860
 your display does not scratch around you that 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.020
 to demonstrate something now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.420
 I have one with the knife and one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.940
 key scratched over the foil and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.160
 see no scratches or other 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.720
 damage on the film you can 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.380
 also with a hammer on the film 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.810
 beat 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.060
 see for yourself and it actually happens 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.220
 the film as well as the ipad nothing 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 Of course you should not always do that 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.540
 make or leave the best 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.030
 this should only demonstrate what the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.280
 foil so endures since the film so 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.950
 stable goes in a fall put the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 film broken in normal circumstances and that 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.020
 display of your device stays whole and 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.450
 To save you high repair costs 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.680
 the panzerglas foil from the company claas 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.280
 It definitely makes sense 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.740
 investment since you euro expensive device before 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.510
 protects the display from damage and the like 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.640
 Good money saves and also the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.920
 resale value therefore does not increase 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.810
 scratch on the display you have from me 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.360
 there is one for the panzerglas foil 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.490
 clear purchase recommendation link to the product 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.350
 course in the video description on 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.750
 claas website is also available 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.750
 even more films such as for 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.910
 the iphone 6 and 1 6 plus and many 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.340
 more devices now we come like 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.290
 announced yet to the game of chance and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.780
 Although one of you has the chance 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.270

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.100

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.010
 We want to write a commentary on the film 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.670
 We want and we currently your devices so 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.200

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.690
 Furthermore, it would be nice too 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.459
