the<00:00:10.510> Geo<00:00:10.690> mod<00:00:10.900> system<00:00:11.260> of<00:00:11.379> the<00:00:11.469> original<00:00:11.860> red

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
the Geo mod system of the original red

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.619 
the Geo mod system of the original red
faction<00:00:12.219> was<00:00:12.520> really<00:00:12.879> pushing<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.270> hardware

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
faction was really pushing the hardware

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.390 
faction was really pushing the hardware
at<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:13.809> time<00:00:14.020> we<00:00:14.500> wanted<00:00:14.709> to<00:00:14.770> go<00:00:14.889> further<00:00:15.129> we

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
at the time we wanted to go further we

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.740 
at the time we wanted to go further we
wanted<00:00:15.639> to<00:00:15.670> do<00:00:15.820> a<00:00:15.850> game<00:00:16.150> where<00:00:16.420> you<00:00:16.539> could

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
wanted to do a game where you could

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.050 
wanted to do a game where you could
bring<00:00:16.930> down<00:00:17.140> buildings<00:00:17.650> piece<00:00:17.949> by<00:00:17.980> piece<00:00:18.160> but

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
bring down buildings piece by piece but

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.790 
bring down buildings piece by piece but
the<00:00:19.240> hardware<00:00:19.570> just<00:00:19.750> wasn't<00:00:20.020> there<00:00:20.170> so<00:00:20.650> we

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
the hardware just wasn't there so we

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the hardware just wasn't there so we
started<00:00:21.100> hearing<00:00:21.310> about<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.640> capabilities

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
started hearing about the capabilities

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.390 
started hearing about the capabilities
of<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.480> PlayStation<00:00:22.990> 3<00:00:23.200> and<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.470> xbox<00:00:23.860> 360

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
of the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.340 
of the PlayStation 3 and the xbox 360
and<00:00:24.640> we<00:00:24.970> decide<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.300> reopen<00:00:25.720> up<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:25.930> franchise

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
and we decide to reopen up the franchise

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.900 
and we decide to reopen up the franchise
with<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.590> whole<00:00:26.740> new<00:00:26.770> destruction<00:00:27.310> system<00:00:27.460> as

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
with a whole new destruction system as

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.310 
with a whole new destruction system as
you're<00:00:28.090> playing<00:00:28.210> through<00:00:28.630> other<00:00:28.810> games<00:00:29.140> that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
you're playing through other games that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
tout destruction you'll find that what

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.020 
tout destruction you'll find that what
you're<00:00:31.570> saying<00:00:31.810> cases<00:00:32.619> is<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.219> special<00:00:33.730> effect

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
you're saying cases is a special effect
