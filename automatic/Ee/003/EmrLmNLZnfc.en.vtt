upgraded exhaust system a K&amp;N filter and
I<00:00:20.939> run<00:00:21.150> synthetic<00:00:21.600> fluids<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.230> it's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350

last<00:00:24.930> year<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:25.650> noticed<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> idles

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
last year so I've noticed that the idles

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
last year so I've noticed that the idles
just<00:00:26.910> gotten<00:00:27.180> rougher<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> rougher<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and found that a lot of people had been

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
and found that a lot of people had been
able<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> fix<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.350> complaint<00:00:37.860> by<00:00:38.579> replacing

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
able to fix this complaint by replacing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
able to fix this complaint by replacing
the<00:00:39.239> overflow<00:00:39.629> valve<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.649> valve<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.040> keeps

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the overflow valve the valve that keeps

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.420 
the overflow valve the valve that keeps
the<00:00:42.170> fuel<00:00:43.170> pressure<00:00:43.350> constant<00:00:44.040> coming<00:00:44.309> from

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the fuel pressure constant coming from

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.479 
the fuel pressure constant coming from
the<00:00:44.520> lift<00:00:44.670> pump<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:46.620> truck<00:00:46.860> also<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> new

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the lift pump this truck also has a new

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
the lift pump this truck also has a new
lift<00:00:47.670> pump<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.480> lift<00:00:48.780> pump<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.110> filter

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
lift pump in it so lift pump and filter

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
lift pump in it so lift pump and filter
didn't<00:00:49.649> fix<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.789> hoping<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
didn't fix this so I'm hoping that that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
didn't fix this so I'm hoping that that
overflow<00:00:52.620> valve<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
overflow valve is what is going on so I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
overflow valve is what is going on so I
thought<00:00:55.079> I'd<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.469> video<00:00:55.710> before<00:00:55.920> I'll

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
thought I'd do this video before I'll

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
thought I'd do this video before I'll
change<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.960> we'll<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> video

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
change that out and then we'll do video

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.540 
change that out and then we'll do video
afterwards<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> demonstrate

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
afterwards and see if we can demonstrate

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
afterwards and see if we can demonstrate
the<00:01:00.059> difference<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> order<00:01:02.219> a

going to install that and see if we can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
going to install that and see if we can
see<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.450> difference<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
see a difference or if we can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.380 
see a difference or if we can
demonstrate<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.280> difference<00:01:38.610> let<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.150> start

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
demonstrate a difference let me start

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.810 
demonstrate a difference let me start
this<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> hard<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> video

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
this up it's kind of hard with the video

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
this up it's kind of hard with the video
to<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.450> demonstrate<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.380> stuff<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to really demonstrate the stuff that you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
to really demonstrate the stuff that you
feel<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.390> seat-of-the-pants

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
feel is kind of a seat-of-the-pants

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.149 
feel is kind of a seat-of-the-pants
experience<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.890> we'll<00:01:50.040> try<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> we're<00:01:53.070> going

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
experience but we'll try so we're going

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.880 
experience but we'll try so we're going
to<00:01:53.220> start<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.729> here

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.680 

so<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:02.970> idles<00:02:03.390> it's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
so right there is where it idles it's

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.890 
so right there is where it idles it's
about<00:02:04.370> just<00:02:05.370> half<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:06.360> halfway<00:02:06.600> between

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
about just half about halfway between

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.670 
about just half about halfway between
the<00:02:07.110> first<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> second<00:02:08.430> mark<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:10.260> notice<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
the first and second mark you notice the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.560 
the first and second mark you notice the
shifter<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.310> hard<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:11.790> too<00:02:12.060> steady<00:02:14.570> you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
shifter it's hard to be too steady you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.670 
shifter it's hard to be too steady you
can<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.140> shakes<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:17.460> than<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.820> ever<00:02:17.970> has

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
can see it shakes more than it ever has

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.020 
can see it shakes more than it ever has
and<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> box<00:02:20.310> sitting<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and I have a box sitting here to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.290 
and I have a box sitting here to
demonstrate<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.060> box

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.280 

kinda<00:02:27.300> jiggles<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.210> we<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.540> get<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> little

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
kinda jiggles so if we can get a little

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.220 
kinda jiggles so if we can get a little
more<00:02:31.470> solid<00:02:31.680> here

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.750 

okay<00:02:37.220> well<00:02:37.489> that's<00:02:37.670> someone<00:02:38.620> anyway<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.580> you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
okay well that's someone anyway and you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.030 
okay well that's someone anyway and you
can<00:02:40.910> hear<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.360> listen<00:02:41.660> close<00:02:41.950> near<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
can hear if you listen close near the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.460 
can hear if you listen close near the
dashboard<00:02:43.519> vibrating<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.080> these<00:02:45.260> are<00:02:45.349> all

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
dashboard vibrating so these are all

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.380 
dashboard vibrating so these are all
things<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.980> hadn't<00:02:46.310> done<00:02:46.459> before<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
things that it hadn't done before it

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
things that it hadn't done before it
started<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.810> run<00:02:47.959> rough<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.340> we'll<00:02:49.970> see
