it<00:01:18.780> says<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> website<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.530> technically

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it says on the website but technically

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
it says on the website but technically
it's<00:01:20.640> actually<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.360> persistent

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it's actually more like persistent

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's actually more like persistent
worlds<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.610> they're<00:01:23.670> gonna<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
worlds because what they're gonna do is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.520 
worlds because what they're gonna do is
they're<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> taking<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> realm<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they're kind of taking the realm of the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
they're kind of taking the realm of the
mad<00:01:25.680> God<00:01:25.979> approach<00:01:26.340> which<00:01:26.549> i<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
mad God approach which i think is a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
gonna have multiple servers and these

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.890 
gonna have multiple servers and these
servers<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.299> gonna<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.540> their<00:01:33.689> own

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
servers are gonna go on their own

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
servers are gonna go on their own
separate<00:01:34.290> timeline<00:01:34.770> where<00:01:34.979> everyone<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
separate timeline where everyone is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.880 
separate timeline where everyone is
fighting<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.960> sort<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> working<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
fighting and it's sort of working up to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
fighting and it's sort of working up to
like<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> final<00:01:38.520> boss<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> final<00:01:39.270> conclusion

call<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.690> one<00:02:53.019> thing<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.230> you're<00:02:53.440> gonna

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
call it one thing that you're gonna

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.140 
call it one thing that you're gonna
notice<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.980> gameplay<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.030> know

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
notice in the gameplay is that you know

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.789 
notice in the gameplay is that you know
the<00:02:55.269> art<00:02:55.450> isn't<00:02:55.690> finished<00:02:56.019> not<00:02:56.379> even<00:02:56.650> all<00:02:56.769> the

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
the art isn't finished not even all the

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.559 
the art isn't finished not even all the
graphics<00:02:57.099> are<00:02:57.400> finished<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:57.940> what<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.120> do<00:02:58.239> like

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
graphics are finished but what I do like

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.380 
graphics are finished but what I do like
is<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.379> functionality<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.760> we

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
is that the functionality is there we

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.900 
is that the functionality is there we
can<00:03:01.660> see<00:03:01.900> really<00:03:02.140> nice<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.890> detailed<00:03:03.370> circles

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
can see really nice and detailed circles

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.430 
can see really nice and detailed circles
this<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.299> big<00:03:04.510> problem<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:05.049> games<00:03:05.260> like

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
this is a big problem in games like

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.350 
this is a big problem in games like
guild<00:03:05.769> wars<00:03:06.040> 2<00:03:06.340> which<00:03:06.579> they<00:03:06.760> try<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.970> fix<00:03:07.150> right

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
guild wars 2 which they try to fix right

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.880 
guild wars 2 which they try to fix right
now<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.870> because<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.319> spell<00:03:08.620> effects

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
now is that because of the spell effects

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.440 
now is that because of the spell effects
it's<00:03:09.129> actually<00:03:09.430> hard<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.730> see<00:03:09.819> what's<00:03:10.180> going

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it's actually hard to see what's going

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.600 
it's actually hard to see what's going
on<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.019> I'm<00:03:11.140> glad<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.379> dust<00:03:11.739> all<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.099> already

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
on and I'm glad that dust all is already

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.729 
on and I'm glad that dust all is already
hitting<00:03:12.910> those<00:03:13.120> points<00:03:13.569> immediately<00:03:14.410> trying

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
hitting those points immediately trying

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.809 
hitting those points immediately trying
to<00:03:14.799> get<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:14.980> functionality<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.670> game

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
to get the functionality of the game

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.280 
to get the functionality of the game
right<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.239> there<00:03:16.389> so<00:03:16.540> we<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.750> see<00:03:16.959> exactly

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
right in there so we can see exactly

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.289 
right in there so we can see exactly
where<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.920> effect<00:03:18.220> circles<00:03:18.579> are<00:03:18.760> all<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.180> that

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
where the effect circles are all of that

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.180 
where the effect circles are all of that
and<00:03:19.900> again<00:03:20.139> I<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.440> stress<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.980> is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
and again I like to stress that this is

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.340 
and again I like to stress that this is
like<00:03:21.670> alpha<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.329> really<00:03:22.630> alpha<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.079> think

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
like alpha this is really alpha I think

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.080 
like alpha this is really alpha I think
technically<00:03:24.040> it's<00:03:24.250> like<00:03:24.340> pre<00:03:24.609> alpha<00:03:24.790> there

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
technically it's like pre alpha there

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.030 
technically it's like pre alpha there
it's<00:03:25.299> just<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.660> stress<00:03:25.930> test<00:03:25.959> guys<00:03:26.440> it's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
it's just a stress test guys it's

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.979 
it's just a stress test guys it's
working<00:03:27.370> really<00:03:27.609> well<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.120> far<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.750> look

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
working really well so far if you look

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.390 
working really well so far if you look
at<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.139> graphics<00:03:29.349> I<00:03:29.680> think<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.069> looks<00:03:30.099> awesome

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
at the graphics I think it looks awesome

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.860 
at the graphics I think it looks awesome
I<00:03:30.819> think<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.090> looks<00:03:31.209> really<00:03:31.269> good<00:03:31.569> now<00:03:31.630> one

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
I think it looks really good now one

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.910 
I think it looks really good now one
thing<00:03:31.900> about<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.319> gameplay<00:03:32.470> though<00:03:32.739> we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thing about the gameplay though we

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.800 
thing about the gameplay though we
should<00:03:32.950> talk<00:03:33.310> about<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.670> gameplay<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.450> am

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
should talk about the gameplay that I am

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.900 
should talk about the gameplay that I am

these<00:04:16.690> are<00:04:16.870> just<00:04:17.050> simple<00:04:17.500> armors<00:04:18.100> maybe<00:04:18.370> we'll

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
these are just simple armors maybe we'll

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.330 
these are just simple armors maybe we'll
have<00:04:18.790> armors<00:04:19.510> that's<00:04:19.870> are<00:04:20.230> even<00:04:20.890> heavier<00:04:21.250> or

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
have armors that's are even heavier or

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.770 
have armors that's are even heavier or
lighter<00:04:21.550> maybe<00:04:22.150> we'll<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.480> have<00:04:22.630> different

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
lighter maybe we'll just have different

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.810 
lighter maybe we'll just have different
ones<00:04:23.080> like<00:04:23.320> one<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.830> just<00:04:24.040> normal<00:04:24.250> leather<00:04:24.580> and

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
ones like one is just normal leather and

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.670 
ones like one is just normal leather and
then<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.180> other<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.110> leather<00:04:26.410> that's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
then the other would be a leather that's

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.350 
then the other would be a leather that's
made<00:04:26.890> for<00:04:27.130> like<00:04:27.370> backpacking<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:28.090> maybe<00:04:28.270> you

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
made for like backpacking so maybe you

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.760 
made for like backpacking so maybe you
have<00:04:28.450> more<00:04:28.600> inventory<00:04:28.930> space<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.590> could<00:04:29.680> be

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
have more inventory space it could be

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.500 
have more inventory space it could be
more<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.040> like<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.190> support<00:04:30.580> character<00:04:30.760> I'm<00:04:31.300> not

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
more of like a support character I'm not

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.360 
more of like a support character I'm not
sure<00:04:31.570> really<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.260> also<00:04:32.620> same<00:04:33.010> thing<00:04:33.220> with

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.940 
sure really I also same thing with
weapons<00:04:33.700> we<00:04:33.850> have<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> bow<00:04:34.390> scepter<00:04:35.320> or<00:04:35.590> staff

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
weapons we have a bow scepter or staff

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.760 
weapons we have a bow scepter or staff
and<00:04:36.280> also<00:04:36.670> a<00:04:36.820> sigh<00:04:37.060> maybe<00:04:37.450> we'll<00:04:37.600> have<00:04:37.810> swords

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
and also a sigh maybe we'll have swords

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.920 
and also a sigh maybe we'll have swords
maybe<00:04:39.310> we'll<00:04:39.460> have<00:04:39.610> sword<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.120> shield<00:04:40.330> who

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
maybe we'll have sword and shield who

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.750 
maybe we'll have sword and shield who
knows<00:04:41.110> definitely<00:04:41.920> tons<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.370> potential<00:04:42.610> there

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
knows definitely tons of potential there

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760 
knows definitely tons of potential there
and<00:04:43.270> that's<00:04:43.930> all<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.110> could<00:04:44.260> talk<00:04:44.470> about<00:04:44.560> right

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
and that's all I could talk about right

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.830 
and that's all I could talk about right
now<00:04:44.830> honestly<00:04:45.400> because<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:46.000> is<00:04:46.120> just<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.330> PvP

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
now honestly because this is just a PvP

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.870 
now honestly because this is just a PvP
stress<00:04:47.260> test<00:04:47.530> I'm<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:48.040> far<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.400> games<00:04:48.610> I'm

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
stress test I'm so far the games I'm

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.070 
stress test I'm so far the games I'm
really<00:04:49.180> excited<00:04:49.390> for<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.720> game<00:04:49.840> especially

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
really excited for the game especially

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080 
really excited for the game especially
for<00:04:50.560> what<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.310> idea<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.880> they're

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
for what the idea is that they're

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.880 
for what the idea is that they're
talking<00:04:52.420> about<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.720> seems<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.710> game

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
talking about it seems like this game

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.440 
talking about it seems like this game
actually<00:04:54.070> has<00:04:54.280> potential<00:04:54.790> like<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.970> lot<00:04:55.300> of

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
actually has potential like a lot of

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.000 
actually has potential like a lot of
potential<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.140> I<00:04:56.290> really<00:04:56.740> think<00:04:56.890> that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
potential and I really think that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.260 
potential and I really think that
they're<00:04:57.190> gonna<00:04:57.280> go<00:04:57.460> through<00:04:57.640> with<00:04:57.790> it<00:04:57.820> doesn't

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
they're gonna go through with it doesn't

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.580 
they're gonna go through with it doesn't
just<00:04:58.450> have<00:04:58.570> potential<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.050> really<00:04:59.350> think<00:04:59.470> that

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
just have potential I really think that

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.080 
just have potential I really think that
they<00:04:59.770> are<00:04:59.800> living<00:05:00.190> up<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.670> they<00:05:00.820> just<00:05:00.970> need

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
they are living up to it they just need

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.700 
they are living up to it they just need
some<00:05:01.270> polish<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.840> know<00:05:01.930> just<00:05:02.110> they<00:05:02.440> just<00:05:02.470> need

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
some polish you know just they just need

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.990 
some polish you know just they just need

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
to keep crafting the game it's super

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.150 
to keep crafting the game it's super
early<00:05:04.150> guys<00:05:04.480> but<00:05:04.870> still<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.290> think<00:05:05.380> it's<00:05:05.860> worthy

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
early guys but still I think it's worthy

to be excited for it honestly do this
game<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.620> just<00:05:08.890> think<00:05:09.010> it's<00:05:09.190> gonna<00:05:09.310> work<00:05:09.400> now

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
game I just think it's gonna work now

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.100 
game I just think it's gonna work now
there's<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.090> game<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.270> long<00:05:10.510> time<00:05:10.570> ago<00:05:10.870> called

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
there's a game a long time ago called

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.780 
there's a game a long time ago called
mortal<00:05:11.440> online<00:05:11.560> which<00:05:12.160> really<00:05:12.340> wanted<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.700> do

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
mortal online which really wanted to do

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.700 
mortal online which really wanted to do
the<00:05:12.910> whole<00:05:13.000> sandbox<00:05:13.480> MMO<00:05:13.870> thing<00:05:14.110> I<00:05:14.290> really

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
the whole sandbox MMO thing I really

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.920 
the whole sandbox MMO thing I really
don't<00:05:14.890> think<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.160> worked<00:05:15.370> out<00:05:15.550> it's<00:05:16.060> just<00:05:16.150> so

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
don't think it worked out it's just so

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.420 
don't think it worked out it's just so
technically<00:05:17.380> difficult<00:05:17.650> with<00:05:17.980> this<00:05:18.100> game<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
technically difficult with this game the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.500 
technically difficult with this game the
way<00:05:18.520> they're<00:05:18.670> going<00:05:18.790> about<00:05:19.030> it<00:05:19.210> because<00:05:19.390> it

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
way they're going about it because it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.390 
way they're going about it because it
stopped<00:05:19.720> down<00:05:19.960> there<00:05:20.230> mixing<00:05:20.440> in<00:05:20.560> 2d<00:05:20.830> art<00:05:21.040> it's

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
stopped down there mixing in 2d art it's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.920 
stopped down there mixing in 2d art it's
gonna<00:05:21.460> be<00:05:21.550> really<00:05:21.760> functional<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.480> think<00:05:22.810> this

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
gonna be really functional I think this

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.270 
gonna be really functional I think this
is<00:05:23.020> gonna<00:05:23.140> work<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.590> even<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:23.950> the<00:05:24.040> stress

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
is gonna work and even in the stress

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.040 
is gonna work and even in the stress
test<00:05:24.490> yeah<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.760> was<00:05:24.880> glitchy<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.390> was<00:05:25.510> it<00:05:25.900> was

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
test yeah it was glitchy it was it was

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.450 
test yeah it was glitchy it was it was
silly<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.560> there's<00:05:27.070> really<00:05:27.220> not<00:05:27.400> enough

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
silly and there's really not enough

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.190 
silly and there's really not enough
content<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.180> really<00:05:28.420> talk<00:05:28.570> about<00:05:28.840> I<00:05:28.960> still

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
content to really talk about I still

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.470 
content to really talk about I still
think<00:05:29.230> it's<00:05:29.650> gonna<00:05:29.800> be<00:05:29.950> way<00:05:30.340> better<00:05:30.520> than<00:05:30.910> most

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
think it's gonna be way better than most

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.060 
think it's gonna be way better than most
other<00:05:31.750> sandbox<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.440> modes<00:05:32.620> out<00:05:32.770> there<00:05:32.980> I

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
other sandbox and the modes out there I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.310 
other sandbox and the modes out there I
really<00:05:33.460> honestly<00:05:33.700> do<00:05:34.210> believe<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:34.840> if<00:05:35.140> you

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
really honestly do believe so so if you

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.590 
really honestly do believe so so if you
like<00:05:35.530> MOBA<00:05:36.070> game<00:05:36.310> play<00:05:36.550> or<00:05:36.700> maybe<00:05:37.150> bloodline

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
like MOBA game play or maybe bloodline
