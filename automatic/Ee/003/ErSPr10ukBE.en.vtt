00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:03.720
 her curtain mold is the same as hers 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:08.780
 previous pupa but she herself completely 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.780
 different and her image is more gentle and 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.780
 air 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.110
 not bright makeup 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 blush on the cheeks crimson lips and bright 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.960
 green eyes like scarlett o'hara 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.310
 Now I will show the hair of this doll 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.520
 closer 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:43.410
 her hair has a brown hairstyle 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:47.870
 consists of a pod and 2 curls still in her 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:55.190
 there is such a curl 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:58.050
 on the right which we go very carefully and 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.590
 adds royal to her hairstyle 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 hell 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.760
 now a dress is made in shades of green 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.920
 velvet top and bottom fabric 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.270
 resembling curtains and the second name 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.820
 This dress is a dress and curtain items 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.400
 This name can be seen for example in 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.400
 belt or shoulder 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.830
 the asymmetry of this dress is very to 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.830
 to face 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.830
 pupae 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.330
 soft green even a little yellow 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.330
 tights and green pointe shoes 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.870
 nails the color of the lips are all very stylish 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.110
 in addition to this pupa goes hat 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.180
 she is not very playful 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.180
 as if going to a masquerade 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.580
 now compared 3 dolls from author Robert 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.499
 from he will tell exactly that 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.369
 Christmas Scarlett possesses 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:24.169
 100% similar to ghi gene 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:26.449
 it's a figment of robert tonner's imagination 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.349
 because we know that there was SkalnÃ­k 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:32.659
 ballerinas but such pupae appeared and we 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:35.080
 we can see it shows in the new ballet 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:39.050
 the light 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.589
 show differences feet ballet Scarlett 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:46.490
 and the usual standard is elegant 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:49.490
 very beautiful stretched with tight 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.809
 sock feet ballet scare or 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.149
 ballet dancer 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:58.999
 she neatly done fingers wait 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:04.699
 manicure or rather pedicure on the feet red 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:09.499
 varnish and study legs like a real 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:11.839
 human and cast the leg completely then 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:14.839
 there is no hinge I even like it 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:17.240
 more because the legs look like 

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:19.339
 really like real and this 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.680
 ordinary standard legs 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:25.819
 Scarlett here they also do not have hinges 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:33.139
 but 

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:35.419
 Diana stop by heel Scarlett such 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.789
 different and different but each other 

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:38.749
 still they are united by the film gone 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:41.629
 by the wind 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:44.569
 if we consider the pupae separately 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:47.659
 then I will add the children for the doll 

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:51.129
 real ballerinas have a great rise 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:55.179
 and this is scarlett truly and ate 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:57.409
 100 percent similarity is obvious 

00:07:55.179 --> 00:08:00.889
 stay with me remember that your 

00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:03.139
 the doll will find you read books see 

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:05.499
 movies with you it was getting hurt 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:05.499
 meeting
