00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.919
 I observed all people it's xenon 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.330
 and today we are on gta 5 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.010
 for a new tutorial then this 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.199
 Once I show you how to win 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.519
 a lot of money and not the little ones 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.750
 ten thousand dollars and that's we can 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.070
 have with glitches and that we can 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.460
 find like that some videos on 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.720
 Youtube 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.250
 so there it is to really win 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.599
 a lot of money hundreds of 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.130
 thousands of dollars in minutes 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.720
 on the other hand for that it will be necessary to see before 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.030
 it's a little bit in the game and having 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.760
 unblocked so either the murders of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.200
 leicester which will be a pnj of the game be 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.850
 to do missions with this 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.460
 famous pnj knowing that each mission 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.079
 with this pnj it always has links with 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 the economy says play and so with the 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.829
 purse and playing pretty well in 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.360
 betting all his money we can recover 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 two or three times our basic bet 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.170
 so it's really very interesting 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.550
 so for this video I chose to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.739
 take the example of an assassination of which 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.940
 I think it does not spoil too much especially 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.120
 many people have had to advance in the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.680
 Thu 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 so with this character you can 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.379
 carry out some assassinations that you 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.150
 will bring back a little bit of clown 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.040
 1000 2000 $ but we do not care it's 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.180
 not that the real reward then there you 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.350
 go see that in the dialogue so 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.260
 with the guy who asks me to murder 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.540
 a business leader he will talk about a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.610
 company called gold coast and 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.780
 our character so franklin will him 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.340
 retort in dialogue 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900
 oh yes you have shares in this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.240
 business or something like that of 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.340
 way a sweet syrup and that actually 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.540
 that's the important part because 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 if he says that it means that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 the murderer he will not only serve 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.880
 murdered a guy who pissed us off or 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.410
 what is it going to be used to sink a 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.780
 company and so the famous company 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.980
 gold coast company which is more or 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.870
 the less the competitor she is going 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.060
 go back up so once you 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.500
 know that you buy a maximum of 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.150
 gold coast company shares you 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.040
 put all your money anyway 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.170
 you do not take risks with that 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.240
 put all your money that's for sure 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.590
 you will earn money in the end you 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.030
 put everything you have 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.230
 knowing that I could bet 300 miles 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.520
 but as soon as you realize a 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.380
 robbery that happens quite early in the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.420
 game I advise you to keep your 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.620
 money to be able to put 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.720
 all our money in the stock market when you 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.010
 will have assassinations carried out a small 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.270
 trick is to do that with all 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.590
 characters once you know who 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.020
 you must murdered I think you 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.030
 can switch characters in order to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 bet 3 times all of your money 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.330
 it will make the technique even more 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.590
 effective even if we can not transfer 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.930
 of money between the characters of this 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.730
 will be to buy stuff 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.769
 independent so once you have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.209
 do that you fulfill the mission so 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.250
 we will murder the CEO of the company 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.079
 competing and then the business 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.340
 competitor should start to sink 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.200
 on the stock market but it's not going to be all 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.939
 right away to finish the technique actually 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 we will have to go back to the base so 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.230
 the house of your character so for me 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.000
 it was franklin we go back and we 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.170
 sleep twice and not just one 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.030
 will advance 12 hours knowing 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.040
 that the first time normally I'm going 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.569
 to show you that is 40% rise 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.609
 so the gold coast company had taken 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.709
 40% of stock market value and the second 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.980
 time she takes 80% or 80 something like 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.989
 it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.159
 after if you sleep again and again 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.569
 the more I tried after five six 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.730
 times anyway it takes more than 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.930
 value of which twice after two 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.129
 times in fact the business will have reached 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.510
 its maximum value and there what you 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.250
 do you switch on each person 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 for each time go to the menu 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.370
 purse of your laptop so that's 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.519
 internet money and services and you 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.840
 go on the first link and so you 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.069
 will be able to resell all your parts and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.389
 double your bet in any case with 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.980
 this business there you have to double 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.900
 your bet so I was 300,000 I 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.159
 passes to 600 miles knowing that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.319
 business function it can be a 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.909
 little bit less having so much more so 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.519
 it depends on how you get to 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.599
 manage that on the show so you realize 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.699
 that's what I hope you 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.169
 will become rich his gta thanks to this tutorial 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.669
 do not hesitate to leave a small lake in 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.959
