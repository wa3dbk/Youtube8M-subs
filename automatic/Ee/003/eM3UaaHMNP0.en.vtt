00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.250
 and so hi to all the friends here 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.000
 stieger 67 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.859
 we end up for a video video where 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.760
 I will introduce a server so here we 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.920
 elite 21 who is the moderator 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.510
 main server me I'm simple 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.750
 moderator that's so I'm going to make a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.980
 slash mode 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.840
 So here you have to go 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.250
 will appear you will be here so I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 would be lippÃ© 1 of the server of the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 description 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 here I am more than yes we have all 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.710
 creative main creators 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 secondary here we have the rules 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 so this game attack mode 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 it will be simpler you show yourself 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 we do you have a big one for the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.579
 cross faster or do warp tac and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 you are here so we have the castle that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.850
 was done to death it's not a 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.130
 plugin I want to clarify 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.619
 because the hours of work that the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 founders and the main moderators 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.220
 have to do it it still deserves 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.080
 a lot of thanks and a lot of 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.860
 down I want to say limits 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.040
 of worship because it's really 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.659
 phenomenal work so here we had two 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.409
 little doors is actually the door that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.390
 on button has overcoming done on 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.619
 landed here you see the verb in one 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.900
 potting soil here or so to bacteria 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.340
 even higher on them on 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 turrets and that allows us to have a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 super of view so if you have nothing to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 do and want to go on this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.810
 waiter for to have beautiful views 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.860
 well, I advise you to go next 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.860
 we have the best 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.119
 so you see here we have a beautiful 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.610
 devil also handmade everything was 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.469
 made to the motion there is no dish 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.099
 guide at the level of constructions in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.530
 any case so here is then on the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.849
 two sides down you have some 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.790
 demonstrate that they give you place in 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.780
 the desert is thus constituted again 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.780
 to make a slash pod 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.500
 slash spots 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.260
 excuse me I had a little moment 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:47.190
 of absence so slash mode guns a tac 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.020
 and here we are 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.110
 where goes this time go in the amap 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.200
 resources and in the amap pvp and here 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.200
 founder cr mastiffs 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.540
 so here is day always find that 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.980
 abba which I do not want to find you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.340
 when I knew that otherwise you will not see 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.390
 how to get there i'm hoping though 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.820
 I am going to lower the graphic qualities 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.320
 from starvation to woman's evil because 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.230
 that this lag we know it's not that changes 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.300
 something graphical options 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.040
 distance during the minimal good I you 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.580
 admit that I lag but I still 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.600
 much less than on other servers 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.330
 there my game and fluid limit while I 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.010
 turns while on some servers 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.470
 even on any other time I loved him to 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.500
 some servers where I also have fluid 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:49.610
 wireless but on that one in 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 so filming here we land in the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.470
 in the pvp zone so also built to 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.670
 the hand so you see here that I do not 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.010
 could do from the moment you 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.180
 get out you're in a pvp and if you 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.180
 climb this waterfall 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.820
 so you land in the table 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.820
 finally on the place of enchantment 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.820
 here 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.570
 to scum 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.350
 so for now we do not have much 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.170
 of people I make the video really 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.660
 to present because because it's 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:36.280
 a server who really deserve to have 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:42.000
 of the world it's a hop of servers so 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 here or there 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.220
 if you are fond of pvp factions and 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:53.080
 all that come on that one knowing that 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.420
 the pvp faction will be activated in a little 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.580
 less than a week we had a small 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.230
 problem with all this so if you 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.460
 watch my video so my video is 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:06.250
 tour on December 8, 2013 so by the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.600
 15 maximum it will be good so the sale has 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.090
 been in the pvp doubt now we're going 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.370
 go to the warp resources and bam 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:19.150
 so you land on a map on 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.500
 a map that will be reset I know 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.490
 plus every how long will it be 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.000
 reset often and if you have any 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.000
 blocks with 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.639
 with the founders so we have a 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.569
 blog where my formula at her who are the 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.810
 two founders and one to lolo who is the 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.250
 co-founder so here it is they who 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.879
 are at the origin of all the superb 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.889
 scenery that you could see 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.000
 so here we go again to 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.449
 an upcoming video a video 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.889
 probably skyblog either skyblog or 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.150
 a new series sky wars 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.400
 so I'll explain the concept to you 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.060
 so always on dope kraft because 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.150
 at home I was banished from plerguer 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.849
 me because I had spam and chat 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.189
 georges was sending two messages to 30 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.460
 seconds of cards and and for them it's 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:22.539
 good spam is like that 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.539
 come on hi everyone
