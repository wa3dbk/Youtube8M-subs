 make a bootable usb stick 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.830
 here and there you choose your key 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:08.420
 usb - this is the age we personally told 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.459
 took a minimum of 4 gigabytes 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.600
 preferable 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.560
 and once you have chosen your 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 usb key you make country begin copping 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.530
 so that means starting the lake at 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.109
 worse so normally your key is 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.600
 automatically formatted the mark and 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.690
 formats thing so no need for the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.420
 format beforehand normally you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.470
 just have to do that so we'll get 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.630
 find it right away once 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.220
 the instinct copying it does because that 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 take a little world at all 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 so here we go 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:55.329
 the copy is finished so now 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.819

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:03.909

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.479
 she starts at startup this is 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.570

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.500
