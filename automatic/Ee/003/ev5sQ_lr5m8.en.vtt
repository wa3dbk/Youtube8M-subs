readers<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:20.280> initially<00:00:20.640> agreed<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.870> then

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
readers and I initially agreed but then

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.200 
readers and I initially agreed but then
when<00:00:22.200> I<00:00:22.290> started<00:00:22.650> thinking<00:00:23.040> about<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.460> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
when I started thinking about it I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
when I started thinking about it I
realized<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.080> that's<00:00:25.320> actually<00:00:25.590> not

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
realized that that's actually not

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.940 
realized that that's actually not
necessarily<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.480> case<00:00:27.690> I<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.020> it's<00:00:28.350> more<00:00:28.440> a

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
necessarily the case I think it's more a

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.359 
necessarily the case I think it's more a
matter<00:00:29.280> of<00:00:29.640> perception<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> sat<00:00:31.740> down<00:00:31.770> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
matter of perception so I sat down to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
matter of perception so I sat down to
make<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> list<00:00:32.879> of<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> ones<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.929> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
make a list of just the ones that I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
make a list of just the ones that I
could<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.769> top<00:00:34.949> of<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.280> head

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
could think of off the top of my head

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.849 
could think of off the top of my head
and<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:36.690> surprised<00:00:37.019> how<00:00:37.230> many<00:00:37.289> I<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.589> able<00:00:37.679> to

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
and was surprised how many I was able to

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.130 
and was surprised how many I was able to
come<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.039> with<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.780> doing<00:00:40.019> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
come up with and then just doing a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
come up with and then just doing a
little<00:00:40.350> bit<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> smoothing<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.489> little

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
little bit of smoothing a little

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.450 
little bit of smoothing a little
googling<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.600> digging<00:00:43.289> around<00:00:43.409> on<00:00:43.890> Goodreads

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
just looking at the lists I was able to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.340 
just looking at the lists I was able to
spot<00:00:47.819> quite<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> few<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.539> knew<00:00:48.780> had<00:00:48.809> male

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
spot quite a few that I knew had male

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.630 
spot quite a few that I knew had male
leads<00:00:49.679> or<00:00:51.350> shared<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.589> spotlight<00:00:52.769> with<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
leads or shared the spotlight with a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
leads or shared the spotlight with a
female<00:00:53.999> lead<00:00:54.359> and<00:00:54.569> I'm<00:00:54.989> sure<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> was

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
female lead and I'm sure if I was

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
a woman most fairy tales revolve around

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.940 
a woman most fairy tales revolve around
a<00:03:48.780> romance<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.480> even<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.560> man<00:03:52.709> isn't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.400 
list within a matter of minutes I'm it
got<00:04:14.580> me<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.880> thinking<00:04:15.000> about<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> fact<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.019> a

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
got me to thinking about the fact that a

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.670 
got me to thinking about the fact that a
lot<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.459> fairy<00:04:17.729> tales<00:04:17.790> do<00:04:18.269> have<00:04:18.680> male

characters so if the fairy tales have
mail<00:04:22.440> main<00:04:22.620> characters<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.400> obviously
