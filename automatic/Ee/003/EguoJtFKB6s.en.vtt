00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.060 
versatile NPV segments where do you
think<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.840> sits<00:00:16.110> in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.620> grand<00:00:16.800> scheme<00:00:16.950> of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
think it sits in the grand scheme of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.180 
think it sits in the grand scheme of
things<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> market<00:00:18.170> well<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.500> suppose<00:00:19.860> it's

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
things in the market well I suppose it's

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.430 
things in the market well I suppose it's
a<00:00:20.280> small<00:00:20.490> segment<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> Ireland<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.600> segment

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
a small segment of Ireland this segment

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.650 
a small segment of Ireland this segment
the<00:00:22.650> Opel<00:00:22.950> Meriva<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.520> there<00:00:23.700> I<00:00:26.150> think<00:00:27.150> what

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the Opel Meriva is in there I think what

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.270 
the Opel Meriva is in there I think what
we<00:00:27.780> have<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.170> car<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.620> a<00:00:28.650> car<00:00:28.950> that<00:00:28.980> has<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
we have in that car is a car that has a

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.820 
we have in that car is a car that has a
frameless<00:00:30.000> design<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.500> probably<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
frameless design I think it's probably a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.260 
frameless design I think it's probably a
nicer<00:00:32.070> design<00:00:32.189> than<00:00:32.550> what's<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> market

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
nicer design than what's in the market

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.959 
nicer design than what's in the market
and<00:00:33.829> maybe<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> second<00:00:35.640> expand

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and maybe we can make that second expand

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.160 
and maybe we can make that second expand
a<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:36.450> selling<00:00:37.230> more<00:00:37.379> than<00:00:37.440> maybe<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:39.170> one

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
a bit by selling more than maybe and one

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.049 
a bit by selling more than maybe and one
might<00:00:40.350> expect<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.339> it's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:41.850> nice

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
might expect I think it's a very nice

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.200 
might expect I think it's a very nice
design<00:00:42.239> car<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.429> be<00:00:44.429> very<00:00:44.519> hopeful<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
design car and be very hopeful to do it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
design car and be very hopeful to do it
obviously<00:00:45.809> diesel<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.469> usually<00:00:46.859> important<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
obviously diesel is usually important is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
obviously diesel is usually important is
that<00:00:47.550> likely<00:00:48.179> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> core<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:50.159> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that likely to be the core I think I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
that likely to be the core I think I
need<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.449> models<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.019> everybody's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
need more for all models and everybody's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.079 
need more for all models and everybody's
talking<00:00:52.920> diesel<00:00:53.429> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.789> once<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:53.969> go

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
talking diesel and I think once you go

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.970 
talking diesel and I think once you go
we'll<00:00:54.269> go<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.839> maybe<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> B<00:00:55.260> segment<00:00:55.530> people

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
we'll go up maybe the B segment people

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.579 
we'll go up maybe the B segment people
are<00:00:56.100> automatically<00:00:57.289> orientated<00:00:58.289> towards

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
are automatically orientated towards

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.380 
are automatically orientated towards
diesel<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.280> probably<00:00:59.579> majority

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
diesel so I think probably majority

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.719 
diesel so I think probably majority
versus<00:01:00.659> Ruby<00:01:00.960> diesel<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:02.249> you<00:01:02.640> know

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
versus Ruby diesel do you have you know

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.399 
versus Ruby diesel do you have you know
do<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> pigeonhole<00:01:03.569> where<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
do you have the pigeonhole where the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
do you have the pigeonhole where the
customer<00:01:04.769> base<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.100> come<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
customer base will come from or is this

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
customer base will come from or is this
a<00:01:05.880> car<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.300> would<00:01:06.360> suit<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.570> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> people<00:01:07.020> do

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
a car that would suit a lot of people do

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
a car that would suit a lot of people do
you<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.640> think<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.909> designs<00:01:09.210> work<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you think I think the designs work I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.910 
you think I think the designs work I
might<00:01:09.690> appeal<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> more<00:01:10.229> people<00:01:10.290> than<00:01:10.620> maybe

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
might appeal to more people than maybe

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
might appeal to more people than maybe
we<00:01:11.100> might<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.460> originally<00:01:12.030> thought<00:01:12.149> because

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
we might have originally thought because

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.120 
we might have originally thought because
this<00:01:13.079> segment<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.649> would<00:01:13.829> have<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.009> an

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this segment if it would have been an

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.709 
this segment if it would have been an
older<00:01:14.399> person<00:01:14.759> secondly<00:01:15.090> people<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.420> looking

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
older person secondly people are looking

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.959 
older person secondly people are looking
for<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.799> space<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> car<00:01:17.579> easier<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
for the more space in the car easier to

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.999 
for the more space in the car easier to
get<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.740> well<00:01:19.890> as

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
get in and out but I think as well as

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
get in and out but I think as well as
the<00:01:20.189> older<00:01:21.180> people<00:01:21.360> who<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.750> certainly<00:01:22.079> go

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the older people who will certainly go

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.260 
the older people who will certainly go
for<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.469> car<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.829> this<00:01:23.159> only<00:01:24.000> people

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
for this car I think this only people

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
for this car I think this only people
who<00:01:24.329> just<00:01:24.509> look<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.810> car<00:01:25.079> designer<00:01:25.649> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
who just look at this car designer and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.260 
who just look at this car designer and
say<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.579> very<00:01:26.759> attractive<00:01:26.820> car<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
say well that's a very attractive car I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
say well that's a very attractive car I
like<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> look<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.439> might<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.740> some

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
like to look I think we might get some

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
like to look I think we might get some
people<00:01:28.950> who<00:01:29.250> might<00:01:29.460> look<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.270> an

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
people who might look at as an

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.109 
people who might look at as an
alternative<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.899> standard<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.159> what

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
alternative to a standard you know what

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
alternative to a standard you know what
can<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> tell<00:01:33.509> us<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:33.810> far<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:34.350> when<00:01:34.829> it's

we're<00:01:44.340> literally<00:01:44.579> finalizing<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> price

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
we're literally finalizing the price

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.370 
we're literally finalizing the price
right<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.780> we're<00:01:45.899> trying<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> make<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.289> as

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
right now we're trying to make it as

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
right now we're trying to make it as
competitive<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.920> possible<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:48.450> view

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
competitive as possible but in my view

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
competitive as possible but in my view
it<00:01:48.719> has<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.049> sold<00:01:49.259> 19,000<00:01:50.070> euros<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.579> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it has to be sold 19,000 euros so you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
it has to be sold 19,000 euros so you
know<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.359> could<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> hopefully<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
know it could be that and hopefully the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.970 
know it could be that and hopefully the
reason<00:01:52.979> we're<00:01:53.100> last<00:01:53.250> minute<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
reason we're last minute on the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.730 
reason we're last minute on the
trying<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.490> get<00:01:54.610> this
