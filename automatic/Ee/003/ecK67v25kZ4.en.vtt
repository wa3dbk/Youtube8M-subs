00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.430
 collection here is the poster that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.810
 came in issue number a lot of correction 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.490
 definitive guard and new marvel 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 unfortunately the collection is available 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.309
 only in the states of são paulo rio de 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.820
 January and Paraíba Paraíba, I do not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.550
 I can tell you why this basis in plans is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 clear of launching in the rest of the country 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 but I think it's going to be only next year 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 saw well the collection is fortnightly will have 60 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.309
 volumes and started here with the spectacular 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 spider-man back home 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.290
 how can you see beautiful cover edition 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.760
 hard the number came with a price below 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 of the market only 9 90 and if you post here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.200
 as I already said 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.729
 how can you see a good role at all 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.189
 of that newspaper paper that the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:35.570
 collectors hate hard cover then 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:40.079
 It's worth every penny and it's gifted. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.579
 As you can see, there's also 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:54.619
 below the market price 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:58.290
 only in 1990 that you can see the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.799
 number 3 has already arrived for me 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:08.190
 I already questioned my collection is the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:11.970
 avengers the fall from this edition 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.160
 the price will become standard at 29 90 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.830
 still at a price lower than the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.320
 practiced in the market mainly this 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.390
 agent is released in the embodied 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.990
 in Brazil for the last few years. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:33.710
 around 60 reais to 29,90 then to 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:37.170
 well priced price is well there to 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.170
 economic situation of the Brazilian 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.350
 Salvatti's promise is that the price 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 continue to rise until the end of 1990 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.360

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.040

 who is inside the collection of 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.510
 salvatti already knows that we have a 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:21.660
 figure on the spine is this figure when 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:32.220
 Exclusive ok so this is personal is 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.840

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580
