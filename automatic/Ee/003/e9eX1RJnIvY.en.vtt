 Hello guys 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.700
 Let's talk about beacons today. 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.259
 complicated and avoided by many people 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.780
 believe that if followed some tips 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.970
 important they can be 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 much more natural 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 follow five steps that will be 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 shown 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 Let's plant paulo step 1 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.669
 our vehicle see three of them approaching 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 of v1 and v2 that there is space between them 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.540
 enough to maneuver our vehicle 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
 but often in the beacons 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.579
 when approaching these places in transit 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 ago what to do at that time the league 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.930
 Arrow remains connected to the right 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.750
 has been brewing very slowly holding 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 the back and pause 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 see two to stop the traffic from behind 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.020
 staff stopped for a kilo going on 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.020
 stage 2 of the goal

 you will advance your vehicle 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.009
 slowly even paired with the vehicle 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.590
 but without leaving the back of your 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.009
 vehicle will pass back from the flight 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.009
 This is super important stopped we go by 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.229
 Step Three Children Steering Wheel All Over To The 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.700
 because the rear of the vehicle is going 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.920
 have to enter right 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 then turn everything from the right and keep 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.369
 in the normal bank position 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.600
 accompanying the rearview mirror image 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.960
 Warm up the third guy goes 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.630
 turning back slowly until the

 vehicle is already inside the cow 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.340
 turned around the opposite continues giving 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.840
 backward chill pepper until approaching 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.299
 get enough of v2 without touching it for
