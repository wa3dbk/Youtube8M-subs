00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the capital of nicaragua stopped growing 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.519
 horizontally and today investors 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.110
 bet to build vertically 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 proof of them are these buildings that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 they rise to the south of the city east 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 building under construction located on 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.930
 the track and in polientes corresponds the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.330
 second hotel that the holiday inn chain 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 installs the new 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.529
 infrastructure responds in this way to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.830
 the strong demand for rooms that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.669
 exists in the country very close to there 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.170
 also build the building scale 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.200
 designed for executive offices that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.870
 develops the group discover the building 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.809
 It has 10 levels and almost 20,000 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.809
 square meters of construction the work 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.870
 employs 120 people and another amount 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.809
 similar indirectly their 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.969
 investors explain that the climate of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.520
 stability enjoyed by the country has been the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 key to the development of the sector in 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.730
 the extent to which the city continues 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 growing 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 will continue to have the need to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.080
 this kind of solutions true today in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.090
 day a great ally 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.860
 of these buildings to say something like 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 Business opportunity is coincidentally 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.540
 the regionalization in the whole world 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.150
 others say globalization but really 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.050
 the regionalization where for example 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.690
 regional brands that are in 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.670
 Central America no longer allow 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.830
 offices are in residential houses 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.010
 poorly designed for office to 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.420
 office purposes 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.220
 well, brands that are our customers 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.890
 they are today in buildings of 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.720
 offices designed for that purpose because 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.320
 they have realized that being 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 In poorly attended offices, it is not 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.979
 sum therefore to the project of each one to the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.930
 brand of each one of the clients true 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.180
 but the fact that growth 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.940
 Managua vertical is concentrating 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.210
 in the southern area has its explanation of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.130
 agreement to investors good I 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.869
 I think there had originally been 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.680
 a little fear with him with the area 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.479
 center of the capital because of the theme that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.760
 the earthquake for everything really everything 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.740
 but also the growth of the city 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.530
 has been horizontal has been towards the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.450
 south urban residential growth has 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.710
 been very strong in the southern area and I 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 I think that same 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.160
 way the office buildings come 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.670
 following that same growth for 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.230
 serve those residents who are 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.330
 balart who are living in this area 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.040
 of the city and they're going to want to have 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.270
 his offices near his house sorry 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 then this 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.610
 we have probably then 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.900
 in half more than half of our 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 clients come from this area of the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.850
 This city is the third building that 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.010
 build the discovery group but not yet 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.290
 they stop and announce that they will continue 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 investing in other points of the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.560
 capital
