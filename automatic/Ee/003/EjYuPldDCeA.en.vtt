yellow and bright turquoise blue that

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
the guy is wearing that's using the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.560 
the guy is wearing that's using the
shotgun<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:42.010> looks<00:00:42.190> kind<00:00:42.429> of<00:00:42.489> nice<00:00:42.609> also<00:00:42.879> but

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
shotgun that looks kind of nice also but

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.810 
shotgun that looks kind of nice also but
one<00:00:43.809> thing<00:00:44.050> that's<00:00:44.260> pretty<00:00:44.469> huge<00:00:44.859> is<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.699> can

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
one thing that's pretty huge is you can

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.110 
one thing that's pretty huge is you can
see<00:00:45.999> just<00:00:46.030> for<00:00:46.629> a<00:00:46.690> split<00:00:46.870> second<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.910> before

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
see just for a split second right before

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.220 
see just for a split second right before
he<00:00:49.510> shoots<00:00:49.719> the<00:00:49.899> guy<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.609> flame<00:00:52.230> coming

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
he shoots the guy there's a flame coming

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.110 
he shoots the guy there's a flame coming
out<00:00:53.499> of<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.519> back<00:00:54.760> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.199> blue<00:00:56.440> guy<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.120> I'm

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
out of the back of the blue guy and I'm

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.450 
out of the back of the blue guy and I'm
thinking<00:00:58.449> this<00:00:58.629> is<00:00:58.960> probably<00:00:59.319> the<00:00:59.800> jetpack

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
thinking this is probably the jetpack

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.320 
thinking this is probably the jetpack
and<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.140> pretty<00:01:02.440> big<00:01:02.739> because<00:01:03.460> they

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
and this is pretty big because they

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.020 
and this is pretty big because they
haven't<00:01:04.510> announced<00:01:04.690> it<00:01:05.140> yet<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.880> people

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
haven't announced it yet and some people

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.700 
haven't announced it yet and some people
because<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.780> thruster<00:01:08.260> pack<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.620> stuff

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
because of the thruster pack and stuff

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.040 
because of the thruster pack and stuff
like<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:08.950> or<00:01:09.490> soon<00:01:09.850> we're<00:01:10.540> assuming<00:01:10.720> that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
like that or soon we're assuming that

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.540 
like that or soon we're assuming that
the<00:01:11.229> jetpack<00:01:12.100> would<00:01:12.520> not<00:01:12.670> be<00:01:12.850> returning<00:01:13.500> but

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the jetpack would not be returning but

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.890 
the jetpack would not be returning but
apparently<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.850> may<00:01:16.150> be<00:01:16.210> unless<00:01:16.660> that's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
apparently it may be unless that's

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.320 
apparently it may be unless that's
something<00:01:17.290> else<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.740> I'm<00:01:18.640> thinking<00:01:19.060> it's<00:01:19.180> not

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
something else and I'm thinking it's not

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.480 
something else and I'm thinking it's not
the<00:01:19.420> thruster<00:01:19.780> pack<00:01:19.930> unless<00:01:20.260> they<00:01:20.530> knew<00:01:21.190> this

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the thruster pack unless they knew this

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.220 
the thruster pack unless they knew this
is<00:01:21.640> really<00:01:21.820> old<00:01:22.120> gameplay<00:01:22.720> that's<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.200> is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
is really old gameplay that's that is

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.290 
is really old gameplay that's that is
possible<00:01:23.830> but<00:01:24.250> when<00:01:24.580> he<00:01:24.670> doesn't<00:01:24.850> really<00:01:25.060> seem

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
possible but when he doesn't really seem

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.570 
possible but when he doesn't really seem
to<00:01:25.360> be<00:01:25.450> boosting<00:01:26.020> forward<00:01:26.440> at<00:01:26.560> all<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:26.950> also

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
to be boosting forward at all and also

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.030 
to be boosting forward at all and also
there's<00:01:27.910> no<00:01:28.090> like<00:01:28.330> explosion<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.230> sparks<00:01:29.860> and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
there's no like explosion of sparks and

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.790 
there's no like explosion of sparks and
stuff<00:01:30.220> out<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.520> back<00:01:30.550> then<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.990> last<00:01:32.500> thing

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
stuff out the back then one last thing

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.320 
stuff out the back then one last thing
to<00:01:32.860> say<00:01:33.100> about<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.370> shotgun<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.120> no

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
to say about the shotgun is that it's no

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.570 
to say about the shotgun is that it's no
longer<00:01:34.360> going<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.870> be<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.950> sort<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.280> power

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
longer going to be some sort of power

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.850 
longer going to be some sort of power
weapon<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:37.240> actually<00:01:37.510> going<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.720> be

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
weapon it's actually going to be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.640 
weapon it's actually going to be
equippable<00:01:38.860> for<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.210> use<00:01:40.510> just<00:01:41.230> as<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
equippable for you to use just as a

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.950 
equippable for you to use just as a
regular<00:01:42.220> weapon<00:01:42.490> kind<00:01:43.120> of<00:01:43.210> like<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.450> shotguns

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
regular weapon kind of like the shotguns

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.150 
regular weapon kind of like the shotguns
in<00:01:44.140> call<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.410> duty<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:46.000> it<00:01:46.690> might<00:01:47.350> be<00:01:47.380> more

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
in call of duty so it might be more

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.980 
in call of duty so it might be more
power<00:01:48.550> down<00:01:48.880> maybe<00:01:49.210> some<00:01:49.480> of<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.660> armor

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
power down maybe some of the armor

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.770 
power down maybe some of the armor
abilities<00:01:50.410> will<00:01:50.560> work<00:01:50.770> with<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.780> we're

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
abilities will work with that we're

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.140 
abilities will work with that we're
gonna<00:01:52.960> have<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.380> see<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.830> don't<00:01:53.980> know<00:01:54.160> how<00:01:55.120> I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
gonna have to see I don't know how I

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.330 
gonna have to see I don't know how I
feel<00:01:55.480> about<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.930> or<00:01:56.140> if<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.470> still<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.890> even

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
feel about that or if it still is even

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.130 
feel about that or if it still is even
like<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.700> they<00:01:57.880> said<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> really<00:01:58.930> long

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
like that they said that a really long

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.040 
like that they said that a really long
time<00:01:59.170> ago<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.770> who<00:02:00.340> knows<00:02:00.720> what<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:01.870> going<00:02:01.990> to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
time ago so who knows what it's going to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.170 
time ago so who knows what it's going to
be<00:02:02.170> like<00:02:02.350> at<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.620> point<00:02:02.920> but<00:02:03.580> at<00:02:03.730> least<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:04.150> a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
be like at this point but at least for a
