 when I'm brewing the storm 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.470

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.879

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.730

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.390

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.620
 honestly as i would like to do underneath 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.180
 Most other people want together 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.280
 they still do not reveal anything 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.020
 we can get very uncomfortable if 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.250
 Do not shut up 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.690
 Do not want to know who they are looking for 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.710
 I'm not used to that one 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.520

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.560
 that's the hydroplane he and now 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.550
 his friends must have known that 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.550
 we are in this area 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.960
 a giant octopus looks like one of 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.830
 lloris monster mars says it all done me 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.240

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.340
 yes I know but I already have one 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.420
 Idea I bet with everyone that he completely 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.420
 will quickly reappear 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.629
 apa 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.240
 I will not let her be safe 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.130
 gripping my machine 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.020
 how do you want to prevent that he is 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.860
 already thought of something and I tell you 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.860

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:49.650
 like the ndr nitro and nice greeting 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.550
 the sharks if you meet him we all 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.890
 fear 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.520
 the faithfulness of our ride in this 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.520
 critical game 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:06.150
 what are you doing in this itunes wrestling 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.150
 one second 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.320

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.480

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.850
 invention stolen what are you doing there 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.230
 I have to admit this time Mr. doctor 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.880
 actually a little miracle 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.230
 done 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.190
 that's right you can do the splendid 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.330
 admire the underwater world 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.770
 what was that noise we are 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:37.870
 not just as a the tax 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:42.010
 I see that I knew that 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.899
 monster has not swallowed you one 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.189
 little nina 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.689
 You see, I told you that 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.610
 there are no monsters and that we are yours 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.039
 We again find mother in this 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.020

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.159
