 is necessarily true positive and negative has to make good the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.869
 when you choose a product but a general recommendation 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.129
 he does not choose exactly how nice the skin needs and often spends 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.929
 much more than necessary 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.779
 but there is no bounce effect bg 1 stop using a product against them 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 insists the fantasy that his face falls off 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.909
 At the time of not using a good product you will have the public asad again or 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.579
 will you feel again 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.300
 that the state store the former attacker 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 Meza 11 seeks a lot turgencia the turgencia is that it will remove that 1 touches it i 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.190
 it's like 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.240
 more plump 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.430
 and good is going to have again 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.970
 need or feeling that you do not also see yourself in the mirror as when you 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.260
 they take care the Japanese have done a fabulous research 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.950
 that admits detected that people who look good and who have a 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.100
 festival therefore by giving higher 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
 they have the shy 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.400
 higher therefore they get sick and child 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.820
 and this is an extraordinary thing to look good 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.040
 Many people 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.880
 positive says good 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 I'm not so good but blankets in the effort go to the bathroom they fixed little 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.800
 little bit of river a little flush percent and they are kind 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.040
 color and maybe 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.550
 they start the day in another way, looking good is very important, we are joining 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.920
 is patricia to give us a specialist doctor in chemistry knows 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.670
 perfectly what you are talking about we are 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.570
 chemistry 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.149
 medicine mood health medicine food 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.899
 everything has to do with the same thing 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:42.760
 p this 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.210
 holistic thinking 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.790
 is more oriented at this time as well said the 90s there was like a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.110
 fascination with the scalpel 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.520
 have a time 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 was cultural is a fashion that was imposed 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 also this adeces this when the times when the outside are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.270
 minimum analyzed 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.430
 the times this of the world the times 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.740
 percent cetera there is also more banalization 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.389
 aesthetics for example 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:18.429
 the cultural models today mmm cristina banegas is a model of a woman of 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.439
 art finished its interior 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.549
 hence, people have much more clear that aesthetics have to accompany 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.639
 also the nutrition of the inside 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.579
 the issue is that this one that I believe a lot in what is lawful I believe a lot in a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.569
 personalized aesthetics 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.999
 in the people who felt that they have the habit of in the one place 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.429
 and ask 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.819
 i recommend for me 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.409
 that's why this entity is so massive 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.419
 intel as the time is to grab a product 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 probably not true and not so 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.660
 Claudia 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.330
 Alice call herself the one who are 'the tribune' leading model and looking and that all 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.360
 Sunday sends messages as it has asserted that they prepared with much 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.560
 love for the team we are going nice but in the end it has indicated that it grabs you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.840
 now 9 many thanks to spain thank you very much thank you we pray for cancer 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.249
 yes the answer to all the girls because 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.229
 it really does if it does not kill us andrÃ©s luque 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.489
 that they also follow a joy to reach a place and that one is wrong 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.449
 take care from customer service 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.609
 they are good people are buoys that people people ask you to repeat in the three 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:39.110
 types 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.869
 This is the principle to be healthy 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.409
 and if it does not stop in two finals this week at the hands of two days 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.050
 to do physical exercise 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.050
 Laugh and make love with whom one wishes 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.289
 in as much as possible the couple or to prepare from now coxswain 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:56.440
 octagenaria will increase 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.020
 of mercy and entities would be the fourth attack 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.090
 much patrician grace and speaking of series it seemed that spoke of the union 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.190
 not old 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.109
 of how all the aspects of the human being communicate so that one can be 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.290
 among them feeding me I was very curious in this case 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.759
 visited place d 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.329
 which is raw food 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.019
 now it's a disease if it's true I experienced it's flavors more 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.620
 intense but avoided a possibility that also binds with maximum chemistry 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.640
 He spoke to me exactly and specifically about how 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
 we are what we eat and many times 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.650
 those foods that we consider loving and healthy 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.029
 they can be poison on the other hand 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.259
 for the body 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.439
 for example 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.399
 dairy carbohydrates as the payment so to pay attention 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.340
 for our explorers burman said we were going to the chapter of the dispute 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.779
 living community what this is about 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.699
 come with me bon scott olsen
