 here as if I were shopping I bought 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.080

 people and you can not negotiate again 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.570

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.909
 When I close, I'll work on others. 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.619

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.350
 several things and pay well less people 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.360

 guys they do not pick up and they do not 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.510
