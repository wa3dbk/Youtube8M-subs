 every little thing you have here like this 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.309
 officially officially I have something 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.500

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.079
 all the viewers I'm going to show you 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.780
 my house is very simple simple but the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.030
 I love very much the spaces that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.120
 they are open here is the balcony where 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.800
 you can see the city there is a dining room 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.809
 cited where rich in the morning one 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.950
 get up and look let's say the sun 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.220
 is going out and having a coffee or a 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.920
 juice that I find the room lovely 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.369
 basically the white is the black and the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.399
 silvery that are very basic colors 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.700
 I like it a lot I'm not like putting 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.570
 little things on tables but I love 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.640
 let's say the lamp and the table sober and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.060
 clean 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 to the side of the room I have the dining room is 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.229
 a very important space for us 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.570
 above all, for me, I am still 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.090
 of the conservative family and good here 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.920
 I like to decorate it with strawberries and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.990
 if there are no fruits then he left 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.210
 only the tray and silver that 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.270
 make the game with the lamp that I 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.040
 love is the mirror that is rich for 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.040
 a woman before leaving always come 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.469
 my kitchen that we always try to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.799
 be supremely line all the time of 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.320
 day and here because I'm not much like 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.360
 decorate fridges or anything like that but this 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.489
 if it was important because my son with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.870
 I remind you that food always 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.970
 is in the dining room that is not in the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.970
 fourth and much less watching television 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.980
 this is the third or fourth quarter of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 guests here is where my always comes 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.269
 family my mom my brothers is a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.580
 very basic room like everything that is 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.250
 in the apartment always here the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 senses are white are beige or are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 coffee always sandin those tonalities not 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.360
 there is much a night table one 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.769
 TV chair and not stop counting 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.769
 I am one of those who have many things 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.940
 This is my son Samuel's room 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.740
 is four and a half years old and is perhaps the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.080
 fourth that more messy keeps 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
 impression that has more color obviously 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.970
 he is already growing and imposing his rules 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 I had the fourth decorated different 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.270
 For example, I had some pictures of 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.709
 animals he took them away said no that 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.709
 I wanted those who had painted it in the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.770
 school ready they got there still they 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.790
 let it handle with the laying of animals 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.790
 just like he loves nature 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.010
 I love this place, because almost 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.210
 always transformed it when I want 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.280
 relax to do a meditation pray 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.620
 be quiet, I run furniture for 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.470
 Beyond our pillows and laying 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.910
 and it is a rich and relaxing place to 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.570
 one enjoy and meet peace 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.570
 inside 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.510
 and this is my main room the fourth 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.100
 that I love and that I love because we have 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.560
 I always like to have her bed like this 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.560
 Giant giant two by two for 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.620
 I can throw myself there at my leisure 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.600
 sleep comfortably the colors are followed 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.820
 basic for example in the room that 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.590
 the silver dominates the black as 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.040
 we saw and in the rooms are the coffee 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.380
 dark the beige and a little touch of red 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.080
 my bed is accompanied by a painting that 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.480
 I gave my mom and little red roses 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.360
 very beautiful roses that always 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.910
 they give me as well as that style of 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.560
 romanticism this is my room here 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.890
 very broad that lets see the city and 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.520
