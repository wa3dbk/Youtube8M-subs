 yes, but I would like to leave in a 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.260
 destination why does the school organize 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.580
 not a school trip because you do not have 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.280
 not parental permission 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.930
 start to some people leave

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.830
 I may be growing but none of our 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.570

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.490
 possible that she left very well 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.560
 and so well go on the school trip 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.180
 it's in the years while the tooth 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.730
 the holidays but you have nothing to do not 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.060

 destination far 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.330

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.360
 that you really should keep your 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:36.409

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.120
 she but you're right 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.780
