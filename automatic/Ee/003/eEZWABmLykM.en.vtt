00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the second state of minimum 1 video today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.319
 I bring you an emulator that is from the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.330
 nintendo 64 console and stimulators is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.640
 very good I have tried and it has not given me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.309
 no mistakes is good we open it 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.520
 and I'm going to start to tell you that this 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.670
 Player needs an Android version 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:27.230
 2.3 points 6 as a day processor 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.789
 hertz l'alcora or dual core with 512 megs 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.029
 from ram 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.620
 good I'm lighted 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 first I will recommend some 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.320
 configurations 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.829
 that are very good 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.499
 first on the touch screen 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.350
 here as is the logic of a 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.769
 rehabilitate it 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 and here in animation we put 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.770
 often if you want it to be 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.860
 move him 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.430
 the polanco that has 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 and this does not give us anything transparency 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.280
 of the buttons here you all your 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.950
 scale style you also what 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.180
 want 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.810
 I will not put here more or less the style 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.030
 of the button here you recommend 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.850
 shaded because that's how they appear 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.670
 were from that of the clean command 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.000
 from 4 and here I only find one lines 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.000
 white 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.480
 this vertical space of buttons put 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 at full height so that the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.140
 buttons are separated normally if 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.409
 they will not all look like they're stuck 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.710
 in our arrangement here in both is 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.770
 to put them the analog and the cross and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.740
 the cross of the command is only we put the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.850
 cross of the command and in this the analog 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 I recommend this if you want to have the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.630
 analog and the cross 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 a video I recommend you move nothing 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.369
 helps all well and if they want to activate 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.289
 this option 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.220
 which says that it improves graphics in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.440
 some devices 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.250
 you want the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.250
 activating 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 well that does not move against things that 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.990
 here we really will not appear 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.950
 will appear like this 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.490
 and I already have a game for example super 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.420
 smash bros 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.420
 let's start 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.890
 and in these to enable the tricks 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.530
 we only activate and here they will come out 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.150
 all the tricks since game has already 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.150
 the tricks installed 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.290
 so that the tricks can work 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.010
 we just have to restart the game 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.010
 and how
