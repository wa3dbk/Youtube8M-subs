00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.640 
227 goals for him were you in favor of
the<00:05:21.280> move<00:05:21.430> in<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.639> first<00:05:21.849> place<00:05:22.050> well<00:05:23.050> yes<00:05:23.380> and

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
the move in the first place well yes and

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.210 
the move in the first place well yes and
no<00:05:23.880> larger<00:05:24.880> yes<00:05:25.180> my<00:05:25.690> reservation<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.620> think<00:05:27.039> is

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
no larger yes my reservation I think is

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.200 
no larger yes my reservation I think is
is<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.729> he<00:05:28.889> possibly<00:05:29.889> has<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.669> potential<00:05:30.970> to

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
is that he possibly has the potential to

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.200 
is that he possibly has the potential to
be<00:05:31.419> fantastic<00:05:31.690> for<00:05:32.110> six<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.770> eight<00:05:32.919> weeks<00:05:33.210> then

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
be fantastic for six to eight weeks then

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.089 
be fantastic for six to eight weeks then
we'll<00:05:34.449> go<00:05:34.570> back<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:34.990> MLS<00:05:35.349> meanwhile<00:05:36.070> a

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
we'll go back to the MLS meanwhile a

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.159 
we'll go back to the MLS meanwhile a
store<00:05:36.610> probably<00:05:36.849> need<00:05:37.389> for<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.690> rest<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.050> the

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
store probably need for the rest of the

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.450 
store probably need for the rest of the
season<00:05:39.070> be<00:05:39.880> they<00:05:40.110> march<00:05:41.110> april<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:41.919> early

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
season be they march april and early

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.730 
season be they march april and early
part<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.030> May<00:05:43.270> they'll<00:05:43.810> need<00:05:44.080> another<00:05:44.110> striker

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
part of May they'll need another striker

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.550 
part of May they'll need another striker
to<00:05:45.159> back<00:05:45.340> up<00:05:45.520> van<00:05:45.699> Persie<00:05:46.150> so<00:05:46.630> I<00:05:46.659> think<00:05:46.810> it<00:05:47.139> the

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
to back up van Persie so I think it the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.710 
to back up van Persie so I think it the
only<00:05:47.770> danger<00:05:47.979> for<00:05:48.340> moving<00:05:48.669> this<00:05:48.880> drawback<00:05:49.330> is

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
only danger for moving this drawback is

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.120 
only danger for moving this drawback is
that<00:05:49.750> it's<00:05:50.080> got<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.320> potential<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.800> paper

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
that it's got the potential to paper

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.950 
that it's got the potential to paper
over<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.400> cracks<00:05:51.490> but<00:05:52.090> while<00:05:52.330> he's<00:05:52.449> here<00:05:52.690> I

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
over the cracks but while he's here I

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.930 
over the cracks but while he's here I
think<00:05:53.380> only<00:05:53.530> has<00:05:53.889> the<00:05:54.039> hunger<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.580> design

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
think only has the hunger and the design

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.300 
think only has the hunger and the design
the<00:05:55.180> goals<00:05:55.389> to<00:05:55.599> really<00:05:55.870> make<00:05:56.020> it<00:05:56.169> work<00:05:56.349> overall

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
the goals to really make it work overall

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.370 
the goals to really make it work overall
are<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.909> happy<00:05:58.330> with<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.720> way<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.990> Arsenal

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
are you happy with the way the Arsenal

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.320 
are you happy with the way the Arsenal
squad<00:05:59.680> looks<00:05:59.860> at<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.159> moment<00:06:00.460> well<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.210> think

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
squad looks at the moment well I think

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.469 
squad looks at the moment well I think
they<00:06:01.599> need<00:06:01.780> backup<00:06:02.349> I<00:06:02.620> think<00:06:03.099> this<00:06:03.250> what<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.639> is

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
they need backup I think this what is is

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.689 
they need backup I think this what is is
good<00:06:04.720> in<00:06:04.840> places<00:06:05.349> it's<00:06:05.770> got<00:06:05.949> some<00:06:06.250> good<00:06:06.460> cover

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
good in places it's got some good cover

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.450 
good in places it's got some good cover
it<00:06:06.880> in<00:06:07.060> central<00:06:07.750> defence<00:06:08.070> centrally<00:06:09.070> filter

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
it in central defence centrally filter

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.129 
it in central defence centrally filter
from<00:06:09.610> stronger<00:06:09.970> Jack<00:06:10.150> Wilshere<00:06:10.599> coming<00:06:10.930> back

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
from stronger Jack Wilshere coming back

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.100 
from stronger Jack Wilshere coming back
and<00:06:11.789> even<00:06:12.789> the<00:06:12.880> wide<00:06:13.060> areas<00:06:13.570> or<00:06:13.780> it's<00:06:13.930> also

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
and even the wide areas or it's also

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.320 
and even the wide areas or it's also
changing<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.830> service<00:06:15.099> and

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
changing the service and

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.450 
changing the service and
after<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:15.870> other<00:06:15.990> night<00:06:16.110> i<00:06:17.009> think<00:06:17.280> is<00:06:17.340> going

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
after the other night i think is going
