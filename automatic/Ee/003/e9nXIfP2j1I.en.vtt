mines times three what the heck just

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.740 
mines times three what the heck just
happened

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
happened

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.300

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.730 
am I seeing things did that say upgrade
cheese<00:02:18.610> mines<00:02:18.850> times<00:02:19.150> 3<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.290> upgraded

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
cheese mines times 3 which is upgraded

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.080 
cheese mines times 3 which is upgraded
the<00:02:20.800> clones<00:02:21.070> Oh

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.540 

so<00:02:25.570> these<00:02:25.900> okay<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.070> equivalent

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
so these okay so this is the equivalent

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.820 
so these okay so this is the equivalent
of<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> newspaper<00:02:28.210> in<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.630> one<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
of the newspaper in this one so the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.670 
of the newspaper in this one so the
clones<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:30.340> upgrade<00:02:30.520> other<00:02:30.910> things<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
clones will upgrade other things it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.060 
clones will upgrade other things it
looks<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:34.530> hang<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.830> could<00:02:35.980> be

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
looks like hang on that could be

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.490 
looks like hang on that could be
important

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
