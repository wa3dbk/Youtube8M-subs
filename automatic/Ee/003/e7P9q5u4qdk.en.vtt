00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 because I do not want to show you today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.270
 like from a normal job board 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.030
 an artistic nice looking one 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 make jewelry storage picture 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.099
 can and the steps are quite whole 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 of course, of course , I remove before 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 all the jewelry I have on it before 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.830
 pinned with very simple pins 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.600
 are of course the simplest variant 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.550
 such a basket board is not expensive me 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.760
 I've had that before and I have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.560
 not a single fan for this tutorial 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 3 project wasted because I put everything there 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.360
 had and I just accessed 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.809
 has let my creativity play and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.309
 yes I wish you a lot of fun you 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 now slowly see what they all have 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.360
 this requires its very simple 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 I had the smallest thing because 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 my father at our home a bit around 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 had papered and so I have the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 wallpaper left over is easy 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 used and it is actually great 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 awesome if you have wallpaper you have left 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 has remained then it is optimal because 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.500
 that looks even more beautiful and yes 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.170
 looks more harmonious if you the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 same wallpaper elements yes available 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.930
 but you can do it instead of wallpaper too 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.949
 would need wrapping paper 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.659
 actually work too 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 yes, and of course I have to do that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.700
 mas out and see that everything is perfect 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.619
 and after I cut that out 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.060
 have the wallpaper piece can be 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.610
 of course, whether the whole on the core 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 quandt leases and it fits and i have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 even while trying it out 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.439
 is optimal in this frame fold fits 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.119
 and just perfect together so fits 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.189
 that was super handy and then have 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.840
 I settled everything and got the first one 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.500
 Frame repainted again 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.850
 you spray this again you see here again 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 after that has dried then I have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030
 started applying the smallest to her 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.409
 as I said normal glue 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 actually take that too 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.040
 fold and pay attention to everything 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.990
 but also on the corners and edges 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 actually considers it quite well in that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 as I said under the frame 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.310
 pushes and it also quite nice 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.659
 well secured and secure and then 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 I just put it that way 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 be careful of course and try 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.479
 Of course, all the bubbles out too 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.860
 push outward but if which 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.869
 stay that is not so bad 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.909
 that even later gets lost 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.409
 time and becomes completely invisible 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.879
 and especially if you are still 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.390
 jewelry and stuff hanging on it have 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.040
 then it is not so tragic 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.900
 then a few nails you can 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.130
 also as I said take normal pins 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.209
 I just took nails now 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.380
 because I thought it was now 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.120
 bit more professional or 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.880
 harmonic looks contrary to the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.100
 previous artwork that I like that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.630
 had made provisionally and completely 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.430
 Practically with the wallpaper is just that 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.340
 because such dots are on the pattern 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.860
 and then I can arrange everything optimally 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.380
 and quite symmetrical to each other simply 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.300
 pure pin repress that works just fine 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.459
 and it also holds in the best way if you are 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.959
 of course that asks for it 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.860
 The nails are not quite as long then 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.780
 you really should not have any 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.760
 have problems and so I hang 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.160
 then the chains on it can be slow 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.650
 this scoreboard will be available later, too 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.239
 hang up quite artistically I have it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.680
 Just leaning against the wall and there you can 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.390
 I also change it 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.280
 stand somewhere else and am a bit 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.230
 flexible, but I already had it 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 on the wall after all chains hang 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.350
 I can now estimate where I have the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 I can hang earrings where I went 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.950
 I want to place 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 and of course it's super fast 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.310
 and that's just super practical 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.739
 you can customize it as you want 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.170
 You can put as many nails as you can 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.970
 earrings or has just the whole 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.799
 Anyway you like it 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.120
 If I want to have some of the earring 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.890
 then look again in the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.350
 infobox over is four pairs 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.970
 earrings of love nina and for it 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.329
 I thank you once your online shop 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.950
 down and rummaged over and otherwise 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.390
 I am then all the stud earrings too 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.820
 Just in and I can always 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.290
 take out again and pin again 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.690
 and yes it is just very nice 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.630
 artistically and is also great 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.880
 handy and that was the whole tutorial 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.010
 I hope you liked it you can 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.079
 as I said, just change it around 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.850
 vary as you have it 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.470
 wanted and I hope I had that 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.950
 inspired and I say goodbye 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.950
 take care 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.450
 Yes
