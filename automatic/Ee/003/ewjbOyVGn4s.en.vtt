00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
I believe the last thing that I'm going

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.370 
I believe the last thing that I'm going
to<00:04:40.140> do<00:04:40.380> quickly<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.250> compare<00:04:41.940> since<00:04:42.600> I<00:04:42.930> didn't

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380
