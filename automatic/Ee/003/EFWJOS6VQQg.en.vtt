up<00:03:18.230> defense<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.950> lines<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.400> yes<00:03:19.610> i<00:03:19.790> think

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
up defense and the lines of yes i think

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.790 
up defense and the lines of yes i think
that<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.330> we<00:03:20.870> feel<00:03:21.080> good<00:03:21.260> about<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.590> jets

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
that that we feel good about the jets

that that we feel good about the jets
defensive<00:03:22.190> line<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:23.150> it's<00:03:23.420> not<00:03:23.600> a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
defensive line so it's it's not a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.690 
defensive line so it's it's not a
terrible<00:03:24.020> pick<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.560> next<00:03:24.709> one<00:03:24.860> kind<00:03:25.610> of

Bridgewater<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.360> still<00:03:44.600> on<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.840> board<00:03:45.170> yeah<00:03:45.620> I

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
Bridgewater is still on the board yeah I

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.770 
Bridgewater is still on the board yeah I
think<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:46.250> think<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.120> definitely<00:03:47.330> go

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
think I think you definitely go

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.360 
think I think you definitely go
Bridgewater<00:03:48.260> there<00:03:48.530> Derek<00:03:48.890> Carney<00:03:49.190> if<00:03:49.250> you're

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370

taking quarterback around 20 you're

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.850 
taking quarterback around 20 you're

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860

in the first round and I think that the
Saints<00:04:28.670> still<00:04:28.880> haven't<00:04:29.240> found<00:04:29.360> someone<00:04:29.660> to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
Saints still haven't found someone to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230 
Saints still haven't found someone to
replace<00:04:30.260> Bushrod<00:04:31.220> since<00:04:31.490> he<00:04:31.580> left<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:31.880> every

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
replace Bushrod since he left in every

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.940 
replace Bushrod since he left in every
