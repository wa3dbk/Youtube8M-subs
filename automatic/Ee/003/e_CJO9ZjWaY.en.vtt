00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 all the nautical terms that we will see 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.109
 next they have as main 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.119
 intended to prevent errors 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.230
 interpretation making the maneuvers 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.300
 faster and safer 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 hence the importance of his knowledge 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.610
 at the time of application do not enter the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610
 navigation 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.250
 using a profile plane of a 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.380
 sailboat we will see the parts more 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.310
 important things that make it up starting 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.310
 as not for the helmet 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.350
 is an approval body and can 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 be built in various materials 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.200
 the most common ones that we will use will be a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.310
 sports prayer will be fiber 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.170
 glass 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.910
 in the front of the helmet that is 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.070
 the one that opens the way to the waters has 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.079
 form row towards the tip 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.210
 by means of a plan on the helmet's floor 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.740
 we will see the most important terms 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 to say the parts of it 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.070
 we will make a longitudinal line 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.260
 call line of the part from the part 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 back to the front of the boat leaving 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 this video in 2 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.460
 the right part will be the band of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.549
 starboard and the left the band of 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.549
 port 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
 now we will make two lines this time 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.659
 perpendicular to the line of the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.610
 ship 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 the front is called bow 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.750
 and the back part that is from where 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 normally the boss directs the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.570
 boat is called water 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.229
 the outer parts of the bow in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 contact with the water are called friends 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.330
 the dentures are called sides 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.950
 again and the later parts of the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.950
 stern are called fins 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.640
 another very important element is the time 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.130
 in sailing ships cruising is usually 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.050
 fixed and ballasted helping balance 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.330
 of it on dinghies 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.670
 always is flip-flops means that 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.780
 we will have to go up and down according to the directions 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.760
 we have navigation 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.650
 The main function of osce is 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.260
 correct the dejection produced by the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.510
 wind the dejection and of the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.459
 different uses of the time depending on 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.209
 the navigation directions we will talk more 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.209
 go ahead in another chapter 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.760
 the rudder is the element that converts 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.350
 any floating object a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 boat as it laporta 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.100
 governance the rudder is made up to its 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.020
 time of several parts 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.390
 the rudder blade behind the surface 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.610
 submerged in the water when opposing some 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.190
 of its two faces to the advance of the boat 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.320
 it produces the turn of it 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.940
 light female the rudder blade is 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.980
 folding which facilitates them greatly 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.560
 the entry and exit from the ground 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 the tiller is the bar that I enter 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.879
 on the boat and allows us to take you 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.040
 one band to another 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.470
 finally the cannon is the extension of 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.269
 the cane very useful and comfortable when we 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.269
 we found a bit away from this one 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.400
 all the elements seen previously 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.380
 they are common to any kind of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.750
 boat now we will see the ones that 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.950
 make up the specific blasting for 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.950
 sailing boats 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.340
 the mast is the vertical pole that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.440
 will later support the sails of 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.840
 boat can be built in various 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.459
 materials in dinghy is used 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.209
 aluminum for its strength and 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.209
 flexibility 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.790
 the boom is the horizontal plane that 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.530
 is articulated on the mast where 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.280
 subsequently, nothing of the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.470
 principal 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.110
 the set of cables and rigging that 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.150
 They keep in place the blasting 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.150
 llama garcÃ­a firm and do not move 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.700
 during the maneuver 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.269
 the two most important elements and of 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.620
 common use in great light are he is there 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.989
 holding the stick from the test of 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.190
 boat and the shrouds holding the stick 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.789
 laterally to each of the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.789
 constants 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.300
 in the next chapter we will see in 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.160
 detail everything about candles 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.160
 its parts and its operation
