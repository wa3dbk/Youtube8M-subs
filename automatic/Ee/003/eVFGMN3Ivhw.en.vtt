00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 a common spider has eight eyes has 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.759
 eight eyes if a spider is watching you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.519
 with his two front eyes with his two 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.730
 frontal eyes and also with three of his 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.830
 other eyes and also with three of his 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 other eyes 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.070
 ok what fraction of the total number of your 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.720
 eyes is watching you and well here you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 you can realize that all spiders 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.420
 they have eight eyes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 5 6 and here there are other 2 7 8 and of equal 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 way is it maybe seems a bit 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.920
 weak before all this but let's focus 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.950
 in the problem if a common spider has 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.559
 8 eyes and the spider is watching you with your 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 two front eyes so imagine that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.310
 you are seeing with these two eyes with this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 from here 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.380
 and with this one from here then what fraction 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 they represent his two front eyes 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.210
 Well, we have eight eyes that are the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 total number of eyes we have and two 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 of them the fronts are seeing ok ya 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.030
 this we have to add another three 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 eyes that are seeing is what is the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.410
 problem in addition to three of your other 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.900
 eyes are seeing you so imagine 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.500
 who is watching you also with this one 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.310
 here with this one here and with this one here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.800
 ok therefore I'm going to take three of 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.470
 his other eyes but also remember that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 we have eight total eyes and then 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.280
 really what I have to take is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 a sum of fractions how much is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.440
 equal this good thing because the father is that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 we have a common denominator 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.630
 common denominator is 8 therefore it 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.450
 will keep and up that I have left 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.450
 well, up there are two more left 3 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.460
 and to this I'm going to add to 3 what is the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.550
 number of eyes that are seeing me in 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.920
 total 23 because we have the same 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.810
 denominator that is to say we have a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.590
 common denominator and this is exactly 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.230
 the same as 2 + 3 is 55 between 8 so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 Both 5 of the 8 eyes that this has 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.080
 spider are watching me in addition to having a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.780
 problem well on sum of fractions 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.780
 we have a spooky problem
