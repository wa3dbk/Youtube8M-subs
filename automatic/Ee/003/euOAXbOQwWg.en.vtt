00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 I will do ito 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.390
 And this 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:18.420

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.250
 It is normally closed tree 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.510
 Hardness is the knot

 This side tie this side now Te I'm here at the point, but this 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.980
 Also 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:24.920
 Bring it to your left side and say why 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:31.580
 Because there is a listener, the way to tie with right and left will be reversed 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.140
 Pulling this in 9 long part contains 9999999 Kyu'tsu and

 Yes this is also a strap 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:49.880
 Now you can adjust the length of the time you wear it and put it on again after you put it on 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.880
 If you pull either side and slide it like this and adjust the height again 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.770
 with this 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.400
 There are many positions of the pendant by this 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.400
 It is yes completed now become favorite place
