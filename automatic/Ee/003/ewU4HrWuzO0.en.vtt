hydraulic lego arm on YouTube allow me

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.360 
hydraulic lego arm on YouTube allow me
to<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.639> how<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.910> works

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
to show how it works

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.669 
to show how it works
all<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.730> valves<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.420> pump<00:00:12.750> are<00:00:13.019> down<00:00:13.349> inside

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
all the valves and pump are down inside

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.480 
all the valves and pump are down inside
this<00:00:13.830> reservoir<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.820> reservoir<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
this reservoir the reservoir is is a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820 
this reservoir the reservoir is is a
little<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> box<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.050> small<00:00:19.470> creator

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
little like a box that small creator

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
little like a box that small creator
sets<00:00:20.130> come<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.550> fairly<00:00:21.449> standard<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
sets come in fairly standard but I

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
sets come in fairly standard but I
thought<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.890> counted<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> Lego<00:00:23.730> piece<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
thought it counted as a Lego piece and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
thought it counted as a Lego piece and
it<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> best<00:00:24.600> thing<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> job<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it was the best thing for the job and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
it was the best thing for the job and
this<00:00:27.210> crank<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.310> spins<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.630> pump

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
this crank up here spins the the pump

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.549 
this crank up here spins the the pump
and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.130> three<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:32.880> levers<00:00:33.239> are

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
and then these three little levers are

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.270 
and then these three little levers are
connected<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.219> pump<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.540> valves<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
connected to the pump to the valves so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:51.400 
connected to the pump to the valves so
let's<00:00:41.280> flip<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.610> valve<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.420> got<00:00:42.660> pumping

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.299 

it's<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.739> strong<00:00:57.949> works<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.190> both

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it's very strong works in both

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:31.249 
it's very strong works in both
directions

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.100 

very<00:01:32.259> exact<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.009> upon<00:01:33.969> impossible<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.899> force

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
very exact and upon impossible to force

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.149 
very exact and upon impossible to force
in<00:01:35.320> any<00:01:35.409> direction

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
in any direction

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.580 
in any direction
although<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.570> Lego<00:01:37.750> Pistons<00:01:38.229> don't<00:01:38.409> have

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
although the Lego Pistons don't have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950 
although the Lego Pistons don't have
very<00:01:38.770> good<00:01:38.890> seals<00:01:39.729> or<00:01:40.119> on<00:01:40.299> their<00:01:40.450> valves<00:01:40.630> and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
very good seals or on their valves and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.960 
very good seals or on their valves and
around<00:01:41.679> their<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.280> ends<00:01:42.490> right<00:01:42.640> there

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
around their the ends right there

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.139 
around their the ends right there
so<00:01:43.829> well<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:44.979> doesn't<00:01:45.310> work<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.729> well<00:01:45.759> and

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
so well it doesn't work so well and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.139 
so well it doesn't work so well and
occasionally<00:01:46.810> air<00:01:46.960> gets<00:01:47.200> into<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> system

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
occasionally air gets into the system

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.889 
occasionally air gets into the system
you<00:01:49.149> can<00:01:49.329> see<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.569> bubble<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.740> there<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
you can see a bubble right there and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.889 
you can see a bubble right there and
another<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:53.530> very<00:01:53.619> easy<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.159> break<00:01:54.460> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
another one it's very easy to break and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.169 
another one it's very easy to break and
I<00:01:55.899> don't<00:01:56.350> really<00:01:56.619> recommend<00:01:56.909> Legos<00:01:57.909> with

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
I don't really recommend Legos with

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:05.330 
I don't really recommend Legos with
hydraulics<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:59.020> doesn't<00:01:59.380> work<00:01:59.789> really<00:02:00.789> well

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.949 

although<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.759> quite<00:02:07.119> impressive<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:07.780> you

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
although it is quite impressive if you

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:47.100 
although it is quite impressive if you
get<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.349> far

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.390 

oops<00:02:49.020> see<00:02:50.020> that's<00:02:50.260> how<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.740> how<00:02:50.950> easy<00:02:51.040> it

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
oops see that's how that's how easy it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.740 
oops see that's how that's how easy it
is<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.760> break<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.480> did<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.320> right<00:02:53.350> then<00:02:54.750> let

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
is to break I just did it right then let

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:12.480 
is to break I just did it right then let
me<00:02:55.840> show<00:02:55.900> you<00:03:09.960> here<00:03:10.960> we<00:03:11.110> detach<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.040> reservoir

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
me show you here we detach the reservoir

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:20.160 
me show you here we detach the reservoir
and<00:03:12.850> take<00:03:13.810> out<00:03:13.990> the<00:03:14.140> assembly<00:03:18.810> very<00:03:19.810> watery

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
and take out the assembly very watery

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.550 
and take out the assembly very watery
drip<00:03:21.100> saw<00:03:21.280> drips<00:03:21.760> everywhere<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:23.140> here's<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
drip saw drips everywhere so here's the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.100 
drip saw drips everywhere so here's the
pumper<00:03:23.950> there<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.670> very<00:03:24.850> bottom<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:26.459> and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
pumper there in the very bottom and and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.520 
pumper there in the very bottom and and
there<00:03:29.110> are<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.320> three<00:03:29.350> valves<00:03:29.920> down<00:03:30.340> there

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
there are the three valves down there

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.650 
there are the three valves down there
and<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.130> pump<00:03:33.459> is<00:03:33.580> in<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.820> very<00:03:34.000> very<00:03:34.450> bottom

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and the pump is in the very very bottom

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.100 
and the pump is in the very very bottom
two<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:36.580> pick<00:03:36.730> up<00:03:36.880> any<00:03:37.030> even<00:03:37.540> if<00:03:37.630> there's<00:03:37.810> just

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
two to pick up any even if there's just

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.930 
two to pick up any even if there's just
the<00:03:38.230> tiniest<00:03:38.530> puddle<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.550> can<00:03:39.700> still

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the tiniest puddle in there it can still

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.900 
the tiniest puddle in there it can still
draw<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.270> up<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:42.010> where<00:03:42.489> have<00:03:42.580> we<00:03:42.700> broken

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
draw it up and so where have we broken

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.130 
draw it up and so where have we broken
this<00:03:43.870> hose<00:03:44.170> popped<00:03:44.920> loose<00:03:45.220> from<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.520> valve

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
this hose popped loose from that valve

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.740 
this hose popped loose from that valve
it's<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:47.440> easy<00:03:48.120> they're<00:03:49.120> really<00:03:49.420> not<00:03:49.540> made

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
it's that easy they're really not made

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.479 
it's that easy they're really not made
for<00:03:49.959> high<00:03:50.050> pressure<00:03:50.290> these<00:03:50.620> Lego<00:03:50.830> hoses<00:03:51.310> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
for high pressure these Lego hoses and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.940 
for high pressure these Lego hoses and
so<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.450> hydraulic<00:03:53.049> system<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.530> high

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
so a hydraulic system is high

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.340 
so a hydraulic system is high
maintenance<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.580> impractical<00:03:55.230> plus<00:03:56.230> you

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
maintenance and impractical plus you

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.660 
maintenance and impractical plus you
gotta<00:03:56.530> fit<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:56.830> all<00:03:57.010> inside<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.489> reservoir

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
gotta fit it all inside the reservoir

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.960 
gotta fit it all inside the reservoir
because<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.900> valves<00:03:59.290> have<00:03:59.500> no<00:03:59.739> return<00:04:00.220> return

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
because the valves have no return return

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.009
