00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
the show now doc folks have been eating

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
the show now doc folks have been eating
grains<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.420> thousands<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.049> years<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.529> now

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
grains for thousands of years and now

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 
grains for thousands of years and now
suddenly<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.220> hear<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.490> grains<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
suddenly we hear that grains are a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
suddenly we hear that grains are a
problem<00:00:18.720> how<00:00:18.840> can<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.080> be

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
problem how can that be

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
problem how can that be
well<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.430> we've<00:00:20.609> been<00:00:20.760> eating

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
well you're right we've been eating

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
well you're right we've been eating
grains<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.510> thousands<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> years<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
grains for thousands of years and that

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.849 
grains for thousands of years and that
represents<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.869> 0.01<00:00:24.869> percent<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.740> the

time that we've been here so you know in
reality<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> past<00:00:29.640> two-and-a-half

reality for the past two-and-a-half
million<00:00:30.539> years<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.590> haven't<00:00:31.830> eaten<00:00:32.099> any<00:00:32.430> grain

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
million years we haven't eaten any grain

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
million years we haven't eaten any grain
and<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.360> only<00:00:33.570> been<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.620> recently

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and it's only been very very recently

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
and it's only been very very recently
that<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.340> came<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.850> our<00:00:35.969> diets<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.230> it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that that came into our diets and it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
that that came into our diets and it
turns<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.890> grains<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.730> wheat<00:00:38.790> contain

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
turns out that grains like wheat contain

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590 
turns out that grains like wheat contain
a<00:00:39.540> protein<00:00:40.170> called<00:00:40.410> gluten<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.390> what<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
a protein called gluten and what the

a protein called gluten and what the
science<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:44.250> focuses<00:00:44.879> on

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
science is all about really focuses on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900 
science is all about really focuses on
the<00:00:45.300> fact<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.629> gluten<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.289> toxic<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the fact that gluten is toxic to the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.150 
the fact that gluten is toxic to the
human<00:00:47.940> body<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.829> something

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
human body now you know that's something

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
human body now you know that's something
that<00:00:50.309> people<00:00:50.670> don't<00:00:50.910> want<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.270> accept<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that people don't want to accept as you

reality the leading science that we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.420 
reality the leading science that we
wrote<00:01:00.180> grain<00:01:00.570> brain<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.590> really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
wrote grain brain about really

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
wrote grain brain about really
demonstrates<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.719> need<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> have

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
demonstrates that we don't need to have

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
demonstrates that we don't need to have
that<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.710> diets<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.369> fact<00:01:05.810> gluten<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that in our diets that in fact gluten in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
that in our diets that in fact gluten in
the<00:01:07.229> diet<00:01:07.439> turns<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.040> inflammation<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.390> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the diet turns on inflammation which is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
the diet turns on inflammation which is
the<00:01:09.720> cornerstone<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.409> such<00:01:10.740> dreaded<00:01:11.310> things

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the cornerstone of such dreaded things

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.870 
the cornerstone of such dreaded things
as<00:01:11.970> Alzheimer's<00:01:12.930> disease<00:01:13.320> Wow<00:01:14.010> okay<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.400> now

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
as Alzheimer's disease Wow okay so now

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
as Alzheimer's disease Wow okay so now
we're<00:01:15.119> constantly<00:01:15.420> told<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> cut<00:01:16.110> back<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.530> fat

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
we're constantly told to cut back on fat

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
we're constantly told to cut back on fat
yet<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.400> new<00:01:17.729> book<00:01:17.909> well<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> says<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> exact

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
yet your new book well it says the exact

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
yet your new book well it says the exact
opposite<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> say<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
opposite so why do you say that we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
opposite so why do you say that we
should<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.540> eating<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.900> fat<00:01:22.080> again<00:01:22.520> fat<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
should be eating more fat again fat is

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
should be eating more fat again fat is
part<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> diet<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> we've<00:01:25.560> eaten<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
part of the diet that we've eaten for

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
part of the diet that we've eaten for
millions<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.909> years<00:01:27.210> we've<00:01:27.869> always<00:01:28.140> eaten<00:01:28.650> fat

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
millions of years we've always eaten fat

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.210 
millions of years we've always eaten fat
and<00:01:29.070> until<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.790> until<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.180> 1992<00:01:31.079> fat<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and until up until about 1992 fat was a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.819 
and until up until about 1992 fat was a
very<00:01:32.579> integral<00:01:33.180> important<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.049> part<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.650> the

very integral important good part of the

human diet all of the research now

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.940 
human diet all of the research now
clearly<00:01:37.770> focuses<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> important<00:01:39.299> role<00:01:39.540> of

clearly focuses on the important role of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.499 
clearly focuses on the important role of
dietary<00:01:40.950> fat<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.430> human<00:01:41.759> health<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
dietary fat in human health now that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.969 
dietary fat in human health now that
doesn't<00:01:42.720> mean<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.110> dietary<00:01:43.590> fat<00:01:43.770> there's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
doesn't mean all dietary fat there's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
doesn't mean all dietary fat there's

so<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.190> talked<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> lot<00:02:41.820> about<00:02:42.890> grain<00:02:43.890> brain

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
so you talked a lot about grain brain

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300 
so you talked a lot about grain brain
you<00:02:45.180> talked<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> lot<00:02:45.510> about<00:02:45.660> grain<00:02:46.140> brain<00:02:46.470> rehab

right<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.810> I'm<00:02:49.110> intrigued<00:02:49.410> what<00:02:49.620> is

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
right so I'm intrigued what is

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.160 
right so I'm intrigued what is
absolutely<00:02:50.250> well<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.510> know<00:02:51.630> when<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.930> make

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
absolutely well you know when you make

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.199 
absolutely well you know when you make
these<00:02:52.410> changes<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.950> your<00:02:53.190> diet<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.700> lifestyle

these changes in your diet and lifestyle

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.180 
these changes in your diet and lifestyle
because<00:02:54.540> there's<00:02:54.720> an<00:02:54.930> exercise<00:02:55.350> component<00:02:55.920> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
because there's an exercise component of

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.670 
because there's an exercise component of
the<00:02:56.280> grain<00:02:56.490> brain<00:02:56.700> print<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.209> plan<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:58.440> we're

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the grain brain print a plan what we're

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.650 
the grain brain print a plan what we're
seeing<00:02:59.040> now<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.640> people<00:03:00.030> within<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
seeing now is that people within a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
seeing now is that people within a
couple<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.140> weeks<00:03:01.200> suddenly<00:03:01.860> notice<00:03:02.520> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
couple of weeks suddenly notice that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.420 
couple of weeks suddenly notice that
they're<00:03:03.510> sharper<00:03:04.350> they<00:03:04.530> are<00:03:04.650> more<00:03:04.890> energetic

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
they're sharper they are more energetic

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.400 
they're sharper they are more energetic
they're<00:03:05.790> remembering<00:03:06.540> things<00:03:06.750> oddly<00:03:07.320> enough

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
they're remembering things oddly enough

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.080 
they're remembering things oddly enough
that<00:03:07.620> they<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:07.920> forgotten<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> long<00:03:08.850> time

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that they have forgotten for a long time

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.210 
that they have forgotten for a long time
the<00:03:09.750> brain<00:03:10.020> has<00:03:10.290> what<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.560> call<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.830> lot<00:03:11.100> of

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the brain has what we call a lot of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.770 
the brain has what we call a lot of
plasticity<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.120> doesn't<00:03:12.390> mean<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.630> made

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
plasticity that doesn't mean it's made

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.230 
plasticity that doesn't mean it's made
out<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> plastic<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.830> means<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.580> means<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.209> can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
out of plastic it means it means it can

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.930 
out of plastic it means it means it can
reshape<00:03:15.810> itself<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.560> regain<00:03:17.130> function

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
reshape itself and can regain function

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.780 
reshape itself and can regain function
so<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.660> absolutely<00:03:18.930> gain<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:20.010> second

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
so you can absolutely gain a second

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.150 
so you can absolutely gain a second
chance<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.269> beyond<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:22.080> when<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> engage
