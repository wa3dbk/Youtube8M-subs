00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
yeah well I guess I'm a chess crossover

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
yeah well I guess I'm a chess crossover
there's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> different<00:02:02.310> crossovers<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
there's a lot of different crossovers in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
there's a lot of different crossovers in
poker<00:02:03.240> people<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.780> backgammon<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.409> our

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
poker people from backgammon like our

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.789 
poker people from backgammon like our
limit<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.399> myself<00:02:05.939> from<00:02:06.329> chess<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
limit down and myself from chess and I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
limit down and myself from chess and I
guess<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.399> don't<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.670> they're<00:02:08.819> cousins<00:02:09.030> or

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
guess I don't know if they're cousins or

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
guess I don't know if they're cousins or
brothers<00:02:09.479> sister<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.679> they're

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
brothers sister but they're they're

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.410 
brothers sister but they're they're
similar<00:02:11.129> games<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> sense<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
similar games in the sense that the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.059 
similar games in the sense that the
discipline<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.140> study<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
discipline and study and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.039 
discipline and study and
sort<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.459> picking<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.329> information<00:02:15.450> is

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
sort of picking up on information is

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.970 
sort of picking up on information is
similar<00:02:16.489> so<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.519> guess<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.930> approach<00:02:19.469> can

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
similar so I guess the the approach can

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.489 
similar so I guess the the approach can
be<00:02:20.040> similar<00:02:20.999> at<00:02:21.209> least<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.689> for<00:02:21.840> me<00:02:21.989> at

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499 
be similar at least it is for me at

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.989 
be similar at least it is for me at
least<00:02:22.560> for<00:02:22.829> my<00:02:22.920> style<00:02:23.189> chest<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.700> chest<00:02:23.879> I

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999

in poland in fact i think it's a great
base<00:03:22.319> i<00:03:22.590> mean<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:22.889> a<00:03:22.919> Canadian<00:03:23.250> or<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.879> know<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
base i mean as a Canadian or you know I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.460 
base i mean as a Canadian or you know I
think<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.659> North<00:03:24.840> Americans<00:03:25.229> think<00:03:25.349> of

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
think all North Americans think of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.129 
think all North Americans think of
Europe<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.799> very<00:03:26.009> small<00:03:26.340> place<00:03:26.669> so<00:03:27.540> when<00:03:28.019> you

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
Europe is a very small place so when you

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.319 
Europe is a very small place so when you
live<00:03:28.349> in<00:03:28.379> one<00:03:28.769> country<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.669> a<00:03:29.909> one-hour

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
live in one country it's a one-hour

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.330 
live in one country it's a one-hour
flight<00:03:30.569> everywhere<00:03:31.049> else<00:03:31.229> so<00:03:31.409> Poland<00:03:32.280> is

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
flight everywhere else so Poland is

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.030
