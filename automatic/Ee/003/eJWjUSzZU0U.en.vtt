00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
definitely beat my goal some might argue

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.770 
definitely beat my goal some might argue
that<00:00:40.250> three<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.670> those<00:00:40.850> books<00:00:41.120> were<00:00:41.300> actually

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that three of those books were actually

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.660 
that three of those books were actually
plays<00:00:42.080> which<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:42.800> did<00:00:42.980> have<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.280> read<00:00:43.430> for<00:00:43.550> class

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670

while<00:00:44.060> I<00:00:44.090> was<00:00:44.360> in<00:00:44.510> London<00:00:44.630> but<00:00:45.440> please<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.670> think

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
while I was in London but please I think

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.090 
while I was in London but please I think
also<00:00:47.240> should<00:00:48.080> be<00:00:48.200> included<00:00:48.590> because<00:00:48.740> you<00:00:48.950> have

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
also should be included because you have

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.710 
also should be included because you have
to<00:00:49.220> take<00:00:49.400> time<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.610> mentally<00:00:50.030> process<00:00:50.330> and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
to take time to mentally process and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.090 
to take time to mentally process and
dissect<00:00:51.050> them<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.290> then<00:00:51.470> talk<00:00:51.650> about<00:00:51.680> them<00:00:52.010> in

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
dissect them and then talk about them in

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.380 
dissect them and then talk about them in
class<00:00:52.130> so<00:00:52.520> you're<00:00:52.640> doing<00:00:52.880> all<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.060> same<00:00:53.240> work

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
class so you're doing all the same work

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
know a normal length book but you're

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.940

doing<00:00:57.050> them<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.290> different<00:00:57.590> way

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
doing them in a different way

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.620 
doing them in a different way

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
unread books on my shelf which seems to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.800 
unread books on my shelf which seems to
be<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.970> little<00:01:53.540> high<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:55.070> am<00:01:55.940> hoping<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.420> in

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
be a little high so I am hoping that in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.770 
be a little high so I am hoping that in
the<00:01:56.930> 25<00:01:57.350> books<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:57.890> read<00:01:58.220> next<00:01:58.790> year<00:01:59.360> this

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
year I guess that ten of them will be

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.679 
year I guess that ten of them will be
from<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.580> books<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:04.880> are<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.119> my<00:02:05.180> shelves
