surefire<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.740> far<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:54.210> nut<00:01:54.509> coming<00:01:54.899> loose

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
surefire so far is the nut coming loose

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.639 
surefire so far is the nut coming loose
and<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.770> starts<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> wiggle<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> get

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and it starts to wiggle a bit so get

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
and it starts to wiggle a bit so get
locked<00:01:58.979> tight<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> modifications

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
locked tight for all the modifications

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.050 
locked tight for all the modifications
for<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.689> gun<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.229> had<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> replace<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.490> led

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for your gun and had to replace and led

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.170 
for your gun and had to replace and led
because<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.869> slamming<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.219> pump<00:02:05.880> back

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
because I was slamming the pump back

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.839 
because I was slamming the pump back
really<00:02:06.750> hard<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.340> caused<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
really hard and I think that caused it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.089 
really hard and I think that caused it
to<00:02:09.030> damage<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> started<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.959> flicker<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to damage and it started to flicker and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.660 
to damage and it started to flicker and
I'd<00:02:11.670> replace<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
I'd replace it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.930 
I'd replace it
I<00:02:13.270> added<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.280> Magpul<00:02:15.280> CTR<00:02:16.030> stock<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.860> my<00:02:18.160> Mesa

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
I added a Magpul CTR stock to my Mesa

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.910 
I added a Magpul CTR stock to my Mesa
tactical<00:02:19.480> buffer<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.930> fits<00:02:20.200> very<00:02:20.470> well<00:02:20.590> with

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
tactical buffer it fits very well with

tactical buffer it fits very well with
the<00:02:21.010> buffer<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.819> doesn't<00:02:22.270> wiggle<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:22.870> anything

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
the buffer it doesn't wiggle or anything

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.210 
the buffer it doesn't wiggle or anything
it<00:02:24.040> actually<00:02:24.489> has<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.200> sling<00:02:26.200> swivel<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.099> you

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
it actually has a sling swivel that you

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.900 
it actually has a sling swivel that you
can<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.739> stock<00:02:30.040> part<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.640> m4

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

stock<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.239> found<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.720> kind<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.050> cool<00:02:35.340> but

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
stock so I found that kind of cool but

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.949 
stock so I found that kind of cool but
I'd<00:02:36.459> rather<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.360> middle<00:02:37.510> mix

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
I'd rather have it on the middle mix

I'd rather have it on the middle mix

saddle<00:02:46.090> people<00:02:46.989> ask<00:02:47.200> me<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.310> comes<00:02:48.550> loose

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
saddle people ask me if it comes loose

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.850 
saddle people ask me if it comes loose
when<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.620> shoot<00:02:51.130> or<00:02:51.370> they<00:02:51.489> fall<00:02:51.549> out<00:02:52.680> when<00:02:53.680> the

when I shoot or they fall out when the

when I shoot or they fall out when the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
head originally it started to come down

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.340 
head originally it started to come down
a<00:02:55.720> little<00:02:55.989> bit<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.560> never<00:02:56.769> had<00:02:57.040> any<00:02:57.069> fallout

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
a little bit but I never had any fallout

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.920 
a little bit but I never had any fallout
III<00:02:59.350> put<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.160> metal<00:03:00.850> coat<00:03:01.239> hanger<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
III put a metal coat hanger in the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.050 
III put a metal coat hanger in the
rubber<00:03:02.110> piece<00:03:02.380> and<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:03.100> made<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.760> stiff

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
rubber piece and it made it really stiff

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.420 
rubber piece and it made it really stiff
and<00:03:04.299> rigid<00:03:04.560> where<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:05.650> hardly<00:03:05.980> even<00:03:06.069> move

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and rigid where they hardly even move

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.330 
and rigid where they hardly even move
now<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:08.080> not<00:03:08.260> really<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:08.650> thing

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
now but that's not really a good thing

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.830 
now but that's not really a good thing
because<00:03:09.700> if<00:03:09.940> you're<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.209> hurry<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.569> need<00:03:10.750> to

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
because if you're in a hurry you need to

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.830 
because if you're in a hurry you need to
get<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.080> slugs<00:03:11.350> out<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.769> into<00:03:12.459> your<00:03:12.640> gun<00:03:13.420> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
get the slugs out and into your gun and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.330 
get the slugs out and into your gun and
it's<00:03:14.110> going<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.260> be<00:03:14.350> harder<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.130> that

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
it's going to be harder to do that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.979 
it's going to be harder to do that
quickly

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
quickly

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.380 
quickly
as<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.400> buckshot<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.440> will<00:03:20.440> recommend<00:03:21.390> getting

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
as for buckshot I will recommend getting

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.819 
as for buckshot I will recommend getting
Hornady<00:03:23.230> tap<00:03:24.329> FPD<00:03:25.329> rounds<00:03:25.840> for<00:03:26.079> your<00:03:26.350> gun<00:03:26.560> I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
Hornady tap FPD rounds for your gun I

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.710 
Hornady tap FPD rounds for your gun I
mean<00:03:27.250> they<00:03:27.430> only<00:03:27.459> hold<00:03:27.880> eight<00:03:28.150> double<00:03:28.600> up

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
mean they only hold eight double up

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.199 
mean they only hold eight double up
buckshot<00:03:29.109> but<00:03:29.739> they<00:03:29.859> go<00:03:30.010> 1600<00:03:30.850> feet<00:03:31.000> per

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
buckshot but they go 1600 feet per

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.250 
buckshot but they go 1600 feet per
second<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.380> can<00:03:32.620> put<00:03:33.269> seven<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.450> my

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
second and I can put seven in my

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.440 
second and I can put seven in my
magazine<00:03:35.620> for<00:03:35.950> one<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.459> chamber<00:03:36.790> I'll<00:03:37.090> show

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
magazine for one in chamber I'll show

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.750 
magazine for one in chamber I'll show
you<00:03:37.510> now<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.410> instead<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.739> having<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:39.250> 20-inch

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
you now so instead of having a 20-inch

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.840 
you now so instead of having a 20-inch
barrel<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.440> Mossberg<00:03:41.769> or<00:03:42.340> whatever<00:03:42.579> and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
barrel like a Mossberg or whatever and

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.660 
barrel like a Mossberg or whatever and
then<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.030> had<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:45.160> magazine

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
then you had to have a magazine

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.729 
then you had to have a magazine
extension<00:03:46.090> flush<00:03:46.630> with<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.650> an

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
extension flush with it I have an

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.810 
extension flush with it I have an
eighteen<00:03:48.070> point<00:03:48.280> five<00:03:48.489> inch<00:03:48.820> barrel<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:50.820> my

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
eighteen point five inch barrel and my

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.670 
eighteen point five inch barrel and my
management<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.359> flush<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.989> usually<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.650> can

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
management is flush and usually you can

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.500 
management is flush and usually you can
hold<00:03:53.920> six<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.430> with<00:03:54.519> these<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.060> hold<00:03:55.180> seven

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
hold six but with these I can hold seven

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:12.860 
hold six but with these I can hold seven
that's<00:03:58.510> five<00:04:00.930> six<00:04:04.319> seven<00:04:09.389> she'll<00:04:10.389> stop

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.069 

usually<00:04:14.989> induce<00:04:15.989> one<00:04:16.230> hand<00:04:17.630> well<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.959> get

they're also fin stabilized what that

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.460 
they're also fin stabilized what that
mean<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.639> wad<00:04:35.880> will<00:04:36.720> open<00:04:37.080> up<00:04:37.229> during

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
mean is the wad will open up during

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.860 
mean is the wad will open up during
flight<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.070> it'll<00:04:38.760> let<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.030> Buckshot<00:04:39.449> glide

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
flight and it'll let the Buckshot glide

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.590 
flight and it'll let the Buckshot glide
out<00:04:40.199> of<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.680> or<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.850> Buckshot<00:04:42.180> glide<00:04:42.389> out<00:04:42.419> of

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
out of the or the Buckshot glide out of

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840 
out of the or the Buckshot glide out of
the<00:04:42.780> wad<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.680> get<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> tighter<00:04:44.160> pattern<00:04:44.250> and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
the wad so you get a tighter pattern and

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.730 
the wad so you get a tighter pattern and
it's<00:04:45.360> going<00:04:45.540> 1,600<00:04:46.139> feet<00:04:46.229> per<00:04:46.380> second<00:04:46.650> that's

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
it's going 1,600 feet per second that's

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.920 
it's going 1,600 feet per second that's
like<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.010> best<00:04:47.190> buckshot<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.910> can<00:04:48.030> get<00:04:48.240> no
