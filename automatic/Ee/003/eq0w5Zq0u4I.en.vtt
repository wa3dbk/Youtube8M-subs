okay so I learned this when I sat with a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.840 
okay so I learned this when I sat with a
tall<00:01:21.000> violinist<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.049> years<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> whenever<00:01:23.670> he

straight<00:02:09.399> okay<00:02:10.399> okay<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.420> positioning<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
straight okay okay so positioning of the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.860 
straight okay okay so positioning of the
violin<00:02:13.099> is<00:02:13.550> going<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:13.970> be<00:02:14.090> more<00:02:14.300> toward<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
violin is going to be more toward the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.690 
violin is going to be more toward the
front<00:02:15.910> then<00:02:17.019> there's<00:02:18.019> also<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.560> issue<00:02:18.769> of<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
front then there's also the issue of the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.360 
front then there's also the issue of the
tilt<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:21.230> violin<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:23.239> realized<00:02:23.870> that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
tilt of the violin and I realized that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.850 
tilt of the violin and I realized that
because<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.580> short<00:02:25.910> arms<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.569> have<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> have

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
because of my short arms I have to have

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.400 
because of my short arms I have to have
the<00:02:28.040> freedom<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.700> having<00:02:29.150> an<00:02:29.330> e<00:02:30.080> string

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the freedom of having an e string

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.619 
the freedom of having an e string
position<00:02:30.950> which<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.700> normal

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
position which is normal

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.110 
position which is normal
it's<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> violin<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.190> only<00:02:34.430> slightly

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
it's where the violin is only slightly

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.410 
it's where the violin is only slightly
angled<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.640> then<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.849> have<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.269> a

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
angled and then I have to have a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.190 
angled and then I have to have a
g-string<00:02:39.049> position<00:02:39.590> where<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.489> actually<00:02:41.200> my

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
g-string position where I actually my

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.910 
g-string position where I actually my
chin<00:02:42.560> moves<00:02:43.130> from<00:02:43.610> being<00:02:44.170> over<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.319> tailpiece

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
chin moves from being over the tailpiece

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.600 
chin moves from being over the tailpiece
a<00:02:46.220> little<00:02:46.519> bit<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:48.290> being<00:02:48.470> clear<00:02:48.920> back<00:02:49.099> here<00:02:49.130> on

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
a little bit to being clear back here on

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.900 
a little bit to being clear back here on
the<00:02:49.730> other<00:02:49.849> corner<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:51.860> my<00:02:52.959> chin<00:02:53.959> rest<00:02:54.910> okay

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the other corner of my chin rest okay

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.789 
the other corner of my chin rest okay
and<00:02:56.030> what<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.360> does<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:58.750> when<00:02:59.750> let<00:03:00.500> me<00:03:00.590> back

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
and what that does is when let me back

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.729 
and what that does is when let me back
up<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:01.099> little<00:03:01.220> bit<00:03:01.459> when<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.480> short<00:03:03.170> person<00:03:03.620> is

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
up a little bit when a short person is

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.520 
up a little bit when a short person is
holding<00:03:03.890> their<00:03:04.160> violin<00:03:04.519> out<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.879> front

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
holding their violin out to the front

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.750 
holding their violin out to the front
that<00:03:06.530> adds<00:03:06.889> more<00:03:07.280> work<00:03:07.880> onto<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.780> shoulder

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
that adds more work onto the shoulder

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.660 
that adds more work onto the shoulder
having<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.970> reach<00:03:11.690> around<00:03:12.200> especially<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.489> the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
having to reach around especially on the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670 
having to reach around especially on the
g<00:03:13.880> string<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:14.359> all<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> g<00:03:15.109> string<00:03:15.440> takes

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
g string we all know the g string takes

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680 
g string we all know the g string takes
more<00:03:15.950> physical<00:03:16.519> effort<00:03:16.880> whether<00:03:17.389> you're

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
more physical effort whether you're

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.039 
more physical effort whether you're
short<00:03:17.959> or<00:03:18.170> tall<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.940> when<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.600> hold<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.870> out

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
short or tall but when you hold it out

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.920 
short or tall but when you hold it out
to<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.350> front<00:03:21.680> that's<00:03:22.280> even<00:03:22.730> more<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.389> than

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
to the front that's even more so than

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.140 
to the front that's even more so than
when<00:03:24.139> you're<00:03:24.319> out<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.709> side<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.880> short

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
when you're out to the side so short

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.990 
when you're out to the side so short
people<00:03:26.389> have<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.930> contend<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.859> when<00:03:28.760> I

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
people have to contend with that when I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.660 
people have to contend with that when I
have<00:03:29.269> an<00:03:29.389> extensive<00:03:29.989> passage<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.099> is<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.549> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
have an extensive passage that is on the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.089 
have an extensive passage that is on the
D<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.090> g<00:03:32.299> string<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.930> will<00:03:33.799> actually

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
D and the g string I will actually

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.550 
D and the g string I will actually
change<00:03:34.579> my<00:03:34.849> violin<00:03:35.269> posture<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.910> it's

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
change my violin posture so that it's

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.400 
change my violin posture so that it's
down<00:03:39.560> further<00:03:40.220> on<00:03:40.370> my<00:03:40.730> chest

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
down further on my chest

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.960 
down further on my chest
here's<00:03:42.410> normal

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.990 

that's<00:03:45.970> my<00:03:46.180> g-string<00:03:46.450> posture<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.700> then<00:03:48.970> I

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
that's my g-string posture and then I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.170 
that's my g-string posture and then I
quickly<00:03:49.269> move<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.599> back<00:03:49.750> up<00:03:49.930> again<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:51.180> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
quickly move it back up again and that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.300 
quickly move it back up again and that
was<00:03:52.299> an<00:03:52.390> accidental<00:03:52.959> discovery<00:03:53.049> when<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.010> was

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
was an accidental discovery when I was

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.420 
was an accidental discovery when I was
trying<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.670> bon<00:03:54.909> musica<00:03:55.629> shoulder<00:03:56.260> rest<00:03:56.500> that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
trying the bon musica shoulder rest that

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.490 
trying the bon musica shoulder rest that
thing<00:03:57.700> keeps<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.329> locked<00:03:58.569> in<00:03:58.840> place<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.439> I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
thing keeps you locked in place and I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.970 
thing keeps you locked in place and I
loved<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.189> because<00:04:00.489> my<00:04:00.640> sloping<00:04:01.239> shoulders

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
loved it because my sloping shoulders

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.179 
loved it because my sloping shoulders
needed<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.459> hook<00:04:03.849> but<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:05.260> did<00:04:05.439> not<00:04:05.590> allow<00:04:05.920> me

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
needed that hook but it did not allow me

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.080 
needed that hook but it did not allow me
to<00:04:06.220> go<00:04:06.939> down<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.709> change<00:04:08.709> my<00:04:08.859> position<00:04:09.340> for<00:04:09.970> the

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
to go down to change my position for the

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.770 
to go down to change my position for the
g-string<00:04:10.629> versus<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.500> e-string<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.659> so<00:04:13.659> at

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
g-string versus the e-string and so at

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.110 
g-string versus the e-string and so at
the<00:04:13.870> end<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.349> three<00:04:14.650> hour<00:04:14.769> opera<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.519> was<00:04:15.790> just

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
the end of a three hour opera I was just

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.479 
the end of a three hour opera I was just
my<00:04:16.389> arm<00:04:16.660> was<00:04:16.900> killing<00:04:17.350> me<00:04:17.500> my<00:04:17.650> neck<00:04:17.949> was<00:04:18.190> sore

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
my arm was killing me my neck was sore

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.810 
my arm was killing me my neck was sore
and<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:19.299> was<00:04:19.419> because<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.079> was<00:04:20.350> having<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.949> twist

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and it was because I was having to twist

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.710 
and it was because I was having to twist
around<00:04:22.030> only<00:04:22.539> by<00:04:22.990> my<00:04:23.139> shoulder<00:04:23.699> without

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
around only by my shoulder without

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.340 
around only by my shoulder without
assisting<00:04:25.720> myself<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:27.490> those<00:04:27.699> are<00:04:27.820> two<00:04:28.350> small

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
assisting myself so those are two small

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.340 
assisting myself so those are two small
simple<00:04:30.310> things<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.060> do<00:04:31.449> as<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:32.020> short

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
simple things that you can do as a short
