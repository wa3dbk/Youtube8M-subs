00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
nice even stream the level is good you

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.010

need to have that check regularly you

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.670 
need to have that check regularly you
take<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.420> below<00:00:43.720> or<00:00:43.930> somewhere<00:00:44.050> like<00:00:44.230> that<00:00:44.379> on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
take it below or somewhere like that on

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.410 
take it below or somewhere like that on
a<00:00:44.710> regular<00:00:44.920> basis<00:00:45.489> they're<00:00:46.000> perfectly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
a regular basis they're perfectly

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.450 
a regular basis they're perfectly
capable<00:00:46.629> of<00:00:46.900> doing<00:00:47.080> that<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.430> other

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
capable of doing that the other

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.640 
capable of doing that the other
important<00:00:49.269> thing<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.449> remember<00:00:49.780> is<00:00:50.170> the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
important thing to remember is the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.439 
important thing to remember is the
different<00:00:51.100> manufacturers<00:00:51.519> color<00:00:52.000> the<00:00:52.210> sticks

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
different manufacturers color the sticks

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.060 
different manufacturers color the sticks
differently<00:00:52.930> you<00:00:53.050> know<00:00:53.170> just<00:00:53.410> for<00:00:53.530> confusion

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
differently you know just for confusion

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.460 
differently you know just for confusion
so<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.120> one<00:00:55.360> we've<00:00:55.570> got<00:00:55.600> standard<00:00:56.290> yellow

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
so on this one we've got standard yellow

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.130 
so on this one we've got standard yellow
soil<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:58.360> normally<00:00:58.809> read<00:00:59.019> the

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
soil and well normally read the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.340 
soil and well normally read the
transmission<00:00:59.710> but

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.160 

most<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.280> sticks<00:01:07.549> are<00:01:07.850> grated<00:01:08.420> there

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
most of the sticks are grated there

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.459 
most of the sticks are grated there
should<00:01:09.350> be<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:09.500> crosshatch<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.759> stick

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
should be a crosshatch on the stick

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:15.580 
should be a crosshatch on the stick
and<00:01:12.649> this<00:01:12.979> one<00:01:13.600> doesn't<00:01:14.600> have<00:01:14.869> cross<00:01:15.140> hatches

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
and this one doesn't have cross hatches

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.730 
and this one doesn't have cross hatches
but<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:15.890> got<00:01:16.039> two<00:01:16.249> lines<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.819> levels<00:01:17.179> good

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
but it's got two lines the levels good

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.050 
but it's got two lines the levels good
and<00:01:18.740> you're<00:01:18.920> gonna<00:01:19.009> want<00:01:19.249> to<00:01:19.340> smell<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
and you're gonna want to smell it and it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.209 
and you're gonna want to smell it and it
smells<00:01:20.090> fine<00:01:20.659> if<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.679> don't<00:01:21.829> know<00:01:22.009> what

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
smells fine if you don't know what

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.520 
smells fine if you don't know what
you're<00:01:22.549> smelling<00:01:22.819> depth<00:01:23.719> that's<00:01:24.170> okay

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
you're smelling depth that's okay

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.190 
you're smelling depth that's okay
because<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.670> only<00:01:26.000> thing<00:01:26.270> that's<00:01:26.509> bad<00:01:26.719> if<00:01:26.929> it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
because the only thing that's bad if it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.899 
because the only thing that's bad if it
smells<00:01:27.439> burnt<00:01:27.740> when<00:01:28.100> it's<00:01:28.249> most<00:01:28.399> burnt<00:01:28.759> you

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
smells burnt when it's most burnt you

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.459 
smells burnt when it's most burnt you
know<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.359> don't<00:01:29.509> have<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.719> be<00:01:29.810> experienced

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
know if you don't have to be experienced

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.730 
know if you don't have to be experienced
it's<00:01:30.679> a<00:01:30.770> nauseating<00:01:30.979> smell<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.229> one<00:01:33.409> another

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
it's a nauseating smell the one another

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.080 
it's a nauseating smell the one another
one<00:01:33.950> that's<00:01:34.039> a<00:01:34.189> little<00:01:34.280> bit<00:01:34.520> different<00:01:34.849> is<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
one that's a little bit different is the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.839 
one that's a little bit different is the
London<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:35.659> on<00:01:35.750> harness<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.319> want<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.859> have

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
London so on harness you want to have

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.490 
London so on harness you want to have
the<00:01:38.030> engine<00:01:38.359> running<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.959> get<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.259> up<00:01:39.380> to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
the engine running and get it up to

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.349 
the engine running and get it up to
operating<00:01:39.619> temperature<00:01:40.069> shut<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:40.880> off<00:01:41.000> and

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
operating temperature shut it off and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.359 
operating temperature shut it off and
then<00:01:41.509> get<00:01:42.200> out<00:01:42.380> check<00:01:42.709> it<00:01:42.740> really<00:01:43.039> quick<00:01:43.250> like

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
then get out check it really quick like

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.770 
then get out check it really quick like
within<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:43.700> minute<00:01:43.969> because<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.329> dipstick<00:01:44.629> is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
within a minute because the dipstick is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.749 
within a minute because the dipstick is
only<00:01:44.899> about<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.289> long<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:46.069> literally<00:01:46.549> sits

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
only about that long it literally sits

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.330 
only about that long it literally sits
right<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.360> fluid<00:01:47.659> reservoir<00:01:48.099> and<00:01:49.099> so<00:01:49.250> if

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
right in the fluid reservoir and so if

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.669 
right in the fluid reservoir and so if
you<00:01:49.429> let<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:49.610> run<00:01:49.819> for<00:01:50.450> too<00:01:51.020> long<00:01:51.200> before<00:01:51.439> you

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
you let it run for too long before you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.800 
you let it run for too long before you
check<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.039> fluid<00:01:52.369> hurt<00:01:52.879> I<00:01:53.090> mean<00:01:53.119> if<00:01:53.599> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
check the fluid hurt I mean if the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.449 
check the fluid hurt I mean if the
vehicle<00:01:54.140> stopped<00:01:54.439> for<00:01:54.709> too<00:01:54.829> long<00:01:55.009> before<00:01:55.219> you

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
vehicle stopped for too long before you

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.100 
vehicle stopped for too long before you
check<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:56.000> fluid<00:01:56.479> drains<00:01:56.810> back<00:01:57.049> down

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.830 

very<00:02:00.680> easy
