00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
muting and stuff like that I probably

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.690 
muting and stuff like that I probably
suggest<00:01:30.259> moving<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.009> different<00:01:31.429> song

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
suggest moving on to a different song

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.669 
suggest moving on to a different song
say<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:34.299> know<00:01:35.299> just<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.600> probably<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.409> lighter

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
say I know just the probably a lighter

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.499

easier song this is pretty easy in

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.480

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
diamond might pick it all I'm not used

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.259 
diamond might pick it all I'm not used
to<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.680> thick<00:02:21.980> peak<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.459> very<00:02:22.940> thick

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:33.390 
to this thick peak it's very thick
indeed<00:02:23.889> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.310 

so<00:02:34.400> that's<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.210> intron<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
so that's all the intron that's the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.620 
so that's all the intron that's the
chorus<00:02:36.650> there<00:02:36.860> actually<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.850> that's

playing that that's sort of chord
progression<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.350> second<00:02:51.680> guitarist<00:02:52.010> can

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
progression the second guitarist can

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.000 
progression the second guitarist can
move<00:02:52.520> on<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.300> second<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.410> think<00:02:54.710> it's<00:02:54.800> after

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
move on to the second I think it's after

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.830 
move on to the second I think it's after
the<00:02:55.220> first<00:02:55.460> chorus<00:02:55.820> from<00:02:56.540> what<00:02:56.690> I've<00:02:56.810> heard

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
the first chorus from what I've heard

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.070 
the first chorus from what I've heard
and<00:02:57.460> it's<00:02:58.460> sort<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:58.970> an<00:02:59.270> octave<00:02:59.630> right<00:02:59.840> there<00:03:00.050> I

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
and it's sort of an octave right there I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.950 
and it's sort of an octave right there I
think<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.220> you've<00:03:01.490> got<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.930> pointing<00:03:02.930> finger

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
think so you've got the pointing finger

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.590 
think so you've got the pointing finger
on<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> seventh<00:03:04.010> fret<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.520> string<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:05.090> then

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
on the seventh fret a string and then

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.650 
on the seventh fret a string and then
the<00:03:05.630> ring<00:03:06.110> finger<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.130> g<00:03:08.030> string<00:03:08.060> ninth

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
the ring finger on the g string ninth

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.020 
the ring finger on the g string ninth
fret<00:03:08.960> so<00:03:09.370> you're<00:03:10.370> going<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.670> playing<00:03:10.940> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
fret so you're going to be playing it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:28.410 
fret so you're going to be playing it
two<00:03:11.210> rounds<00:03:11.360> so

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.000 

so<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:29.870> are<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:30.020> gonna<00:03:30.290> do<00:03:30.530> while<00:03:30.830> you've

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
so what are you gonna do while you've

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.280 
so what are you gonna do while you've
got<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.640> day<00:03:31.820> use<00:03:32.660> your<00:03:32.840> middle<00:03:32.960> finger

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
got them to day use your middle finger

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.290 
got them to day use your middle finger
will<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> do<00:03:33.590> anyway<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.100> meet<00:03:34.670> all<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.060> rest<00:03:35.240> of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
will I do anyway to meet all the rest of

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.240 
will I do anyway to meet all the rest of
the<00:03:35.420> strings<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.080> lightly<00:03:36.470> hover<00:03:36.800> over<00:03:37.130> the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
the strings so lightly hover over the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.500 
the strings so lightly hover over the
other<00:03:37.670> strings<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.150> you're<00:03:38.270> not<00:03:38.360> playing

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
other strings that you're not playing

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.710 
other strings that you're not playing
and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.710 

so<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:49.180> can<00:03:49.330> use<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> other

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
so just like that you can use the other

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.240 
so just like that you can use the other
fingers<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.290> you're<00:03:50.470> using<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:51.130> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
fingers that you're using just the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.860 
fingers that you're using just the
middle<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.700> other<00:03:51.820> strings<00:03:52.180> as<00:03:52.420> well<00:03:52.600> but

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
middle the other strings as well but

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.430 
middle the other strings as well but
whatever<00:03:53.380> works<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:54.270> okay<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:55.330> why<00:03:55.960> you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
whatever works for you okay so why you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.230 
whatever works for you okay so why you
only<00:03:56.620> play<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.040> twice<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.790> then<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.000> can

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
only play that twice and then you can

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.810 
only play that twice and then you can
move<00:03:58.390> back<00:03:58.630> on<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.140> your<00:03:59.530> initial<00:03:59.830> initial

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
move back on to your initial initial

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.780 
move back on to your initial initial
root<00:04:01.060> doing<00:04:04.170> then<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.290> move<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.890> okay

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
root doing then you move on to that okay

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.550 
root doing then you move on to that okay
and<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.420> second<00:04:07.720> guitarists<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.260> think<00:04:08.440> it's

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and the second guitarists I think it's

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.730 
and the second guitarists I think it's
after<00:04:09.010> after<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.790> second<00:04:10.300> set<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.660> verses<00:04:11.020> or

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
after after the second set of verses or

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.250 
after after the second set of verses or
during<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.130> second<00:04:12.640> set<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:13.000> think<00:04:13.030> he<00:04:13.840> starts

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
during the second set I think he starts

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
during the second set I think he starts
plucking<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:15.010> you'll<00:04:15.190> notice<00:04:15.520> in<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.850> song

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
plucking so you'll notice in the song

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.800 
plucking so you'll notice in the song
when<00:04:16.269> you've<00:04:16.390> heard<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.840> you'll<00:04:17.230> be<00:04:17.380> like

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.140 

something<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:26.610> you're<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.820> 6th

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
something like that so you're on the 6th

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.140 
something like that so you're on the 6th
and<00:04:28.330> 4th<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.590> g<00:04:29.860> string<00:04:29.890> there<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.940> g

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
and 4th on the g string there the g

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:42.300 
and 4th on the g string there the g
string<00:04:31.450> so

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.350 

six<00:04:44.830> six<00:04:45.830> six<00:04:46.720> six<00:04:47.720> four<00:04:48.050> six<00:04:48.740> one<00:04:49.000> then

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
six six six six four six one then

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.510 
six six six six four six one then
six<00:04:51.190> six<00:04:52.360> then<00:04:53.360> four<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.700> B<00:04:56.000> string<00:04:57.520> then

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
six six then four on the B string then

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.440 
six six then four on the B string then
finish<00:04:58.880> back<00:04:59.150> on<00:04:59.330> six<00:04:59.630> on<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> g<00:05:00.560> string<00:05:00.590> there

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
finish back on six on the g string there

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.580 
finish back on six on the g string there
you'll<00:05:02.450> get<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.750> eventually<00:05:02.960> just<00:05:03.260> keep

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
you'll get it eventually just keep

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.650 
you'll get it eventually just keep
practicing<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:05.150> shouldn't<00:05:05.450> take<00:05:05.480> you

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
practicing and it shouldn't take you

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.830 
practicing and it shouldn't take you
long<00:05:05.690> at<00:05:06.020> all<00:05:06.290> it's<00:05:06.770> very<00:05:06.860> easy<00:05:07.250> song<00:05:07.580> actually

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.960 

now<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:14.900> can<00:05:15.170> use<00:05:15.680> just<00:05:15.950> down<00:05:16.250> strums<00:05:16.670> if<00:05:16.850> you

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
now you can use just down strums if you

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.580 
now you can use just down strums if you
want<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.480> all<00:05:17.720> up<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.140> whatever<00:05:18.380> is
