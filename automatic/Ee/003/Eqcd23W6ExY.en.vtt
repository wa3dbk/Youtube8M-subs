hey<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:00.659> today<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> be<00:00:01.439> talking

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hey guys today we're going to be talking

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.169 
hey guys today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:01.800> what<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> lot<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.700> guys<00:00:02.879> have<00:00:03.060> been

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
about what a lot of you guys have been

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.150 
about what a lot of you guys have been
waiting<00:00:03.419> for<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.380> that's<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> electric

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
waiting for and that's the electric

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.629 
waiting for and that's the electric
wiring<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.910> this<00:00:06.600> layout<00:00:07.049> now<00:00:07.680> be<00:00:08.160> patient

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
wiring of this layout now be patient

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.919 
wiring of this layout now be patient
with<00:00:08.760> me<00:00:08.910> because<00:00:09.179> I'm<00:00:09.269> gonna<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.599> divide

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
with me because I'm gonna have to divide

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.890 
with me because I'm gonna have to divide
this<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:10.759> segments<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.880> videos<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.660> how<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
this into segments of videos on how to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.099 
this into segments of videos on how to
wire<00:00:13.230> layout<00:00:13.740> because<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.130> very<00:00:14.400> complex

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
wire layout because it's very complex

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.029 
wire layout because it's very complex
but<00:00:16.109> today<00:00:16.350> we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
but today we're going to get in the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.370 
but today we're going to get in the
introduction<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.820> wiring<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:19.050> keep<00:00:19.230> in

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
introduction of wiring and just keep in

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.130 
introduction of wiring and just keep in
mind<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.250> layout<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.939> not<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.840> as

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
mind that my layout is not the same as

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
mind that my layout is not the same as
your<00:00:22.350> layout<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> wiring<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
your layout so a lot of the wiring is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.359 
your layout so a lot of the wiring is
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.990> improvised<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
going to have to be improvised if you

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
going to have to be improvised if you
have<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> different<00:00:27.090> layout<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.349> or

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
have a different layout that I have or

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.620 
have a different layout that I have or
you're<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> books<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.570> do

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you're going to get in the books and do

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.690 
you're going to get in the books and do
the<00:00:30.720> research<00:00:30.990> yourself<00:00:31.340> Model<00:00:32.340> Railroader

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the research yourself Model Railroader

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.840 
the research yourself Model Railroader
has<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> book<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.570> DCC<00:00:34.530> wiring<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.190> there's<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
has a book for DCC wiring and there's a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.209 
has a book for DCC wiring and there's a
lot<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> online<00:00:36.270> resources<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.350> DCC<00:00:37.829> wiring

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
lot of online resources for DCC wiring

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
lot of online resources for DCC wiring
so<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> interpretive<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.410> what

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
so a lot of it is interpretive to what

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.830 
so a lot of it is interpretive to what
you've<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:41.940> layout<00:00:42.149> I've

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you've got going on on your layout I've

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
you've got going on on your layout I've
got<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.290> layout<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> double<00:00:44.219> oval<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
got my layout with a double oval you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430 
got my layout with a double oval you
know<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.480> something<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
know if you got something like that you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.260 
know if you got something like that you
can<00:00:46.590> probably<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.280> able<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> figure<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> out

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can probably be able to figure it out

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
can probably be able to figure it out
I've<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:49.020> modules<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.770> made<00:00:50.399> some

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I've also got modules so I made some

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
I've also got modules so I made some
different<00:00:51.420> steps<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.199> I've<00:00:52.410> taken<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
different steps that I've taken that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.490 
different steps that I've taken that
some<00:00:53.129> people<00:00:53.399> may<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:55.199> we'll<00:00:55.350> go

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
some people may not take but we'll go

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
some people may not take but we'll go
over<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> track

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
over that but just like with the track

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
over that but just like with the track
when<00:00:58.140> you're<00:00:58.260> laying<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> track<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
when you're laying out the track you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.889 
when you're laying out the track you
need<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> track<00:00:59.640> plan<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
need a track plan you kind of need a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.200 
need a track plan you kind of need a
wiring<00:01:01.379> schematic<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.010> diagram<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.030> know

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
wiring schematic or diagram so you know

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
wiring schematic or diagram so you know
what<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.480> doing<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.920> me<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.670> red

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
what you're doing now for me I'm red

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
what you're doing now for me I'm red
green<00:01:06.299> colorblind<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.200> being<00:01:07.560> under<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
green colorblind so being under the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
green colorblind so being under the
table<00:01:08.159> under<00:01:08.340> dark<00:01:08.640> light<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.150> can't<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
table under dark light I can't really

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
table under dark light I can't really
see<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> difference<00:01:10.350> between<00:01:10.680> red<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.920> green

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
see the difference between red and green

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.690 
see the difference between red and green
colors<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.540> using<00:01:12.780> black<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> yellow<00:01:14.040> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
colors so I'm using black and yellow for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.469 
colors so I'm using black and yellow for
my<00:01:14.939> wires<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> pick<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> wire<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
my wires now you need to pick a wire and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.399 
my wires now you need to pick a wire and
keep<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> side<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> rail<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.820> example

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
keep it with a side of rail for example

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
keep it with a side of rail for example
I'm<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.830> yellow<00:01:23.430> rail<00:01:23.700> our<00:01:24.420> yellow

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm going to have yellow rail our yellow

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.280 
I'm going to have yellow rail our yellow
wire<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.710> outside<00:01:26.130> rail<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:27.750> each<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
wire on the outside rail of each one of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
wire on the outside rail of each one of
these<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.130> black<00:01:29.460> wire<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> inside<00:01:30.090> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
these and black wire on the inside a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
these and black wire on the inside a
rail<00:01:30.689> never<00:01:31.170> switch<00:01:31.560> them<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.920> you're<00:01:32.040> going

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
rail never switch them or you're going

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
rail never switch them or you're going
to<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.340> problems<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.299> that's<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> first

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
to have problems so that's the first

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
to have problems so that's the first
thing<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.799> you've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> keep<00:01:35.340> aware<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
thing that you've got to keep aware of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.690 
thing that you've got to keep aware of
when<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.150> doing<00:01:36.380> wiring<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> was

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
when you're doing wiring now I was

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
when you're doing wiring now I was
talking<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.360> diagrams<00:01:39.930> let's<00:01:40.170> go

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
talking about the diagrams let's go

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.450 
talking about the diagrams let's go
ahead<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.500> take<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> look<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
ahead and take a look at what we have

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.039 
ahead and take a look at what we have
here<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.520> an<00:01:44.670> example<00:01:45.060> where

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
here now this is an example where

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
here now this is an example where
they've<00:01:46.229> used<00:01:46.470> blue<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> orange<00:01:47.159> I've<00:01:48.060> got

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
they've used blue and orange I've got

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.130 
they've used blue and orange I've got
yellow<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.409> black<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:51.600> make<00:01:51.750> sure<00:01:51.780> one

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
yellow and black so just make sure one

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
yellow and black so just make sure one
color<00:01:52.439> goes<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.759> these<00:01:54.720> jumpers<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
color goes to these jumpers here or to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.929 
color goes to these jumpers here or to
these<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> block<00:01:57.509> terminals<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:59.490> barrier

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
these a block terminals or barrier

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.800 
these a block terminals or barrier
strips<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.420> sorry

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
strips I'm sorry

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.550 
strips I'm sorry
so<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.399> screw<00:02:03.170> boxes<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.380> with

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so all these screw boxes here with

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.780 
so all these screw boxes here with
screws<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.040> those<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.340> called<00:02:05.490> barrier

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
screws on them those are called barrier

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.930 
screws on them those are called barrier
strips<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.360> we're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:07.020> over<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
strips and we're going to go over that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.130 
strips and we're going to go over that
but<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> basically<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.080> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
but this is basically what it's going to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.380 
but this is basically what it's going to
look<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.560> under<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
look like under the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900 
look like under the

to look at it closer feel free to do so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.090 
to look at it closer feel free to do so
but<00:02:18.830> you've<00:02:18.980> got<00:02:19.190> pink<00:02:19.490> for<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:21.100> barrier

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
but you've got pink for the barrier

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.020 
but you've got pink for the barrier
strip<00:02:22.670> jumpers<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.420> you've<00:02:23.810> got<00:02:24.370> outer<00:02:25.370> rail

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
strip jumpers and you've got outer rail

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.150 
strip jumpers and you've got outer rail
in<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.330> case<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.750> orange<00:02:27.140> inner<00:02:27.590> Rails<00:02:27.830> blue

in this case is orange inner Rails blue
I'm<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.850> modify<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.630> mine

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I'm just going to modify it to mine

now that we've shown you that let's go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
now that we've shown you that let's go
over<00:02:36.350> some<00:02:36.560> things<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.890> you're<00:02:37.010> going<00:02:37.100> to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
over some things that you're going to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.640 
over some things that you're going to
need<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:38.239> I'm<00:02:38.510> using<00:02:38.720> these<00:02:38.989> because<00:02:39.260> I'm<00:02:39.530> not

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
need now I'm using these because I'm not

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.860 
need now I'm using these because I'm not
much<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.130> soldering<00:02:40.489> guy<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> hate<00:02:41.390> soldering

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
much of a soldering guy I hate soldering

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.960 
much of a soldering guy I hate soldering
Oh<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.220> I'm<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.489> be<00:02:43.610> able<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.790> do

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
Oh so what I'm going to be able to do

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.120 
Oh so what I'm going to be able to do
with<00:02:44.120> these<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:45.290> simply<00:02:45.590> run<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.950> wire

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
with these is this simply run the wire

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.490 
with these is this simply run the wire
under<00:02:46.459> these<00:02:46.610> screws<00:02:47.000> under<00:02:47.959> these<00:02:48.110> metal

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
under these screws under these metal

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.240 
under these screws under these metal
tabs<00:02:48.739> here<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.560> screw<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> down<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.130> that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
tabs here and screw it down and that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.699 
tabs here and screw it down and that
will<00:02:52.459> create<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.910> connection<00:02:53.300> in<00:02:53.930> between<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
will create a connection in between the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.729 
will create a connection in between the
screw<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.160> metal<00:02:55.400> tab<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.590> can

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
screw and the metal tab so as you can

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.940 
screw and the metal tab so as you can
see<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:58.280> here<00:02:58.820> fits<00:02:59.780> perfectly<00:03:00.320> in<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.769> my

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
see this here fits perfectly in with my

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.800 
see this here fits perfectly in with my
diagram<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:03.230> these<00:03:03.500> eight<00:03:03.950> post<00:03:04.810> strips

diagram with these eight post strips
here<00:03:06.050> now<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.100> pick<00:03:07.250> these<00:03:07.400> up<00:03:07.459> at

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
here now you can pick these up at

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.880 
here now you can pick these up at
RadioShack<00:03:08.000> they're<00:03:08.750> called<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.320> position

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
RadioShack they're called a position

RadioShack they're called a position
dual<00:03:10.100> row<00:03:10.340> barrier<00:03:10.730> strips<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:12.380> my<00:03:12.620> case<00:03:12.680> I

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
dual row barrier strips and in my case I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.819 
dual row barrier strips and in my case I
need<00:03:13.459> six<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.880> them<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.510> I've<00:03:14.930> got<00:03:15.140> six<00:03:15.470> ready

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
need six of them so I've got six ready

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.620 
need six of them so I've got six ready
to<00:03:16.010> go<00:03:16.209> ordered<00:03:17.209> off<00:03:17.329> RadioShack<00:03:17.959> calm<00:03:18.440> and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
to go ordered off RadioShack calm and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.759 
to go ordered off RadioShack calm and
then<00:03:20.630> on<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.900> diagram<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.470> see<00:03:21.620> these

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
then on the diagram you see these

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.509 
then on the diagram you see these
smaller<00:03:22.510> barrier<00:03:23.510> strips<00:03:24.010> they<00:03:25.010> are<00:03:25.250> called

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
smaller barrier strips they are called

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.030 
smaller barrier strips they are called
to<00:03:25.790> position<00:03:26.269> dual<00:03:26.510> row<00:03:26.780> barrier<00:03:27.440> strips<00:03:27.739> and

to position dual row barrier strips and

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.970 
to position dual row barrier strips and
you<00:03:28.100> can<00:03:28.280> see<00:03:28.430> them<00:03:28.579> here<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.829> they<00:03:30.829> are

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
you can see them here and they are

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.190 
you can see them here and they are
located<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.640> there<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.510> diagram<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.110> I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
located on there on the diagram and I

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.960 
located on there on the diagram and I
need<00:03:33.380> 12<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.549> those

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
need 12 of those

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.949 
need 12 of those
so<00:03:35.600> actually<00:03:36.590> 13<00:03:37.070> because<00:03:37.549> I've<00:03:37.850> got<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.810> make

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
so actually 13 because I've got to make

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
to get to the metal because it's

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.210 
to get to the metal because it's
insulated<00:05:01.060> into<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:01.930> little<00:05:02.650> casing<00:05:03.039> you've

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
got to get to the bare metal so you can

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.460 
got to get to the bare metal so you can
connect<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.800> your<00:05:06.009> bird<00:05:06.250> your<00:05:07.470> burger

is<00:05:26.050> off<00:05:26.639> only<00:05:27.639> modular<00:05:28.240> module<00:05:28.630> so<00:05:28.840> when<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:28.990> go

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
is off only modular module so when I go

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.649 
is off only modular module so when I go
to<00:05:29.199> move<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.889> can<00:05:30.580> easily<00:05:30.729> disconnect<00:05:31.479> these

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
to move I can easily disconnect these

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.360 
to move I can easily disconnect these
now<00:05:32.319> I<00:05:32.349> don't<00:05:32.469> have<00:05:32.620> wires<00:05:32.889> hanging<00:05:33.039> out

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
now I don't have wires hanging out

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.909 
now I don't have wires hanging out
everywhere<00:05:33.759> and<00:05:34.060> when<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.779> you<00:05:35.349> know<00:05:35.380> get<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.770> my

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
everywhere and when I you know get to my

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.350 
everywhere and when I you know get to my
new<00:05:36.130> location<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:36.909> put<00:05:37.180> them<00:05:37.240> back

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
new location I can put them back

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.730 
new location I can put them back
together<00:05:37.539> that<00:05:37.750> makes<00:05:38.139> for<00:05:38.319> a<00:05:38.349> good<00:05:39.029> solid

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
together that makes for a good solid

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.700 
together that makes for a good solid

them grouped together with zip ties if

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.209 
them grouped together with zip ties if
you<00:05:54.699> can<00:05:55.020> there's<00:05:56.020> going<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.349> be<00:05:56.409> this<00:05:56.680> bus

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
you can there's going to be this bus

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.800 
you can there's going to be this bus
line<00:05:57.870> once<00:05:58.870> again<00:05:59.110> on<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.349> diagram<00:05:59.830> that<00:06:00.810> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
line once again on the diagram that the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.499 
line once again on the diagram that the
line<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.409> bus<00:06:02.560> line<00:06:02.830> runs<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.940> connections

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
line the bus line runs the connections

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.959 
line the bus line runs the connections
from<00:06:04.840> one<00:06:05.080> barrier<00:06:05.949> strip<00:06:06.219> to<00:06:06.370> another<00:06:06.699> and

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
from one barrier strip to another and

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:08.279 
from one barrier strip to another and
that<00:06:07.000> goes<00:06:07.389> all<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.569> way<00:06:07.719> around<00:06:08.050> and<00:06:08.199> you

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
that goes all the way around and you

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.980 
that goes all the way around and you
have<00:06:08.440> to<00:06:08.590> keep<00:06:08.800> it<00:06:08.979> on<00:06:09.159> its<00:06:10.060> appropriate<00:06:10.779> side

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
have to keep it on its appropriate side

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.570 
have to keep it on its appropriate side
so<00:06:11.289> if<00:06:11.409> it's<00:06:11.529> a<00:06:11.620> derail<00:06:11.919> you<00:06:12.099> got<00:06:12.190> to<00:06:12.279> keep<00:06:12.400> it

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
so if it's a derail you got to keep it

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.189 
so if it's a derail you got to keep it
on<00:06:12.669> one<00:06:12.969> side<00:06:13.180> and<00:06:13.509> in<00:06:13.569> a<00:06:13.659> row<00:06:13.810> you<00:06:13.930> get<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.110> keep

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
on one side and in a row you get to keep

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.890 
on one side and in a row you get to keep
on<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.500> other<00:06:14.650> side<00:06:14.889> so<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:16.150> then<00:06:16.719> those

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
on the other side so and then those

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.689 
on the other side so and then those
Spade<00:06:17.169> connectors<00:06:17.680> on<00:06:17.830> this<00:06:17.979> other<00:06:18.159> diagram

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
Spade connectors on this other diagram

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.920 
Spade connectors on this other diagram
here<00:06:18.969> you<00:06:19.150> can<00:06:20.110> see<00:06:20.349> are<00:06:20.620> going<00:06:20.770> to<00:06:20.889> be<00:06:21.930> on

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
here you can see are going to be on

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.480 
here you can see are going to be on
connections<00:06:23.680> that<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:23.949> need<00:06:24.099> to<00:06:24.219> easily

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
connections that I need to easily

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.920 
connections that I need to easily
disconnect<00:06:25.029> when<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.210> need<00:06:25.419> to<00:06:25.509> move<00:06:25.690> so

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
disconnect when I need to move so

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.719 
disconnect when I need to move so
basically<00:06:26.289> in<00:06:26.560> between<00:06:26.589> modules<00:06:27.159> is<00:06:27.580> where

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
basically in between modules is where

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:28.940 
basically in between modules is where
the<00:06:27.880> Spade<00:06:28.210> connectors<00:06:28.690> are

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
the Spade connectors are

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.970 
the Spade connectors are
to<00:06:28.980> be<00:06:29.130> in<00:06:29.220> my<00:06:29.400> case<00:06:29.930> so<00:06:30.930> keep<00:06:31.470> all<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:31.830> in

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
to be in my case so keep all that in

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.430 
to be in my case so keep all that in

here<00:07:02.130> but<00:07:02.820> I'm<00:07:02.910> going<00:07:03.060> to<00:07:03.090> mount<00:07:03.240> those<00:07:03.480> up<00:07:03.690> and

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
here but I'm going to mount those up and

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.720 
here but I'm going to mount those up and
then<00:07:04.140> I'm<00:07:04.230> going<00:07:04.350> to<00:07:04.440> work<00:07:04.500> on<00:07:04.680> the<00:07:04.770> wiring<00:07:05.010> so

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
then I'm going to work on the wiring so

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.790 
then I'm going to work on the wiring so
this<00:07:05.970> next<00:07:06.180> video<00:07:06.510> I<00:07:06.810> will<00:07:07.080> have<00:07:07.110> all<00:07:07.530> these

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
this next video I will have all these

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.190 
this next video I will have all these
barrier<00:07:08.250> strips<00:07:08.430> mounted<00:07:08.940> in<00:07:09.060> place<00:07:09.270> we<00:07:10.080> will

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
barrier strips mounted in place we will

video editing software I've got some one

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.790 
video editing software I've got some one
order<00:07:27.180> but<00:07:27.390> I<00:07:27.420> don't<00:07:27.690> have<00:07:27.840> time<00:07:28.020> to<00:07:28.260> cut<00:07:28.470> scene

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
order but I don't have time to cut scene

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.710

and<00:07:29.070> stuff<00:07:29.280> like<00:07:29.400> that<00:07:29.610> so<00:07:29.640> I'm<00:07:30.450> going<00:07:30.570> to<00:07:30.630> have

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
and stuff like that so I'm going to have

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.960 
and stuff like that so I'm going to have
to<00:07:30.810> do<00:07:30.930> a<00:07:30.960> video<00:07:31.230> of<00:07:31.440> break<00:07:32.130> it<00:07:32.310> down<00:07:32.460> one<00:07:32.790> by

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
to do a video of break it down one by

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:33.410 
to do a video of break it down one by
one

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420 
one

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.200 
one
so<00:07:34.050> you're<00:07:34.380> seeing<00:07:34.620> it<00:07:34.770> step<00:07:35.010> by<00:07:35.040> step<00:07:35.220> per

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
so you're seeing it step by step per

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.490 
so you're seeing it step by step per
video<00:07:36.540> so<00:07:36.780> there's<00:07:36.930> going<00:07:37.020> to<00:07:37.080> be<00:07:37.200> probably

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
video so there's going to be probably

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.640 
video so there's going to be probably
three<00:07:38.340> four<00:07:38.670> maybe<00:07:38.910> five<00:07:39.270> videos<00:07:39.720> just<00:07:40.470> on
