00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 guava and cheese a combination 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.670
 classic that every Brazilian likes 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.410
 now imagine guava fruit inside a loaf 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.730
 cheese is too much 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.769
 today I will share with you my 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 version with cheese we will put 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:24.210
 guava gets wonderful next does 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
 part of the brazil service policy 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 of recipes in gurupi 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.949
 Can you click on the link I'm going to? 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.750
 Leave it down here and it will take you to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.090
 where several partners have 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.360
 videos especially with recipes has 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.059
 I like to start this recipe. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 This is a traditional cheese loaf I 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:54.289
 I'll put the milk in my pan 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.289
 oil and albums 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 We'll wait until we get up. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.800
 boil fink to see we will stay the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.589
 with this hot mix and it will 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.390
 mixing mixing until all the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.390
 people are developing in the book 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.000
 here is cheese mozzarella cheese 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 grated parmesan will mix it here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 well I really like this combination that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 I think the mozzarella leaves the bread 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.840
 cheese with a little more texture by 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 cent 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.980
 at the time it melts better and the parmesan 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.150
 It's more salty I think it gives a taste 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.920
 special too 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.050
 so always use this combination more 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.820
 you can use the traditional kers too 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.770
 I know it's not that way. 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.220
 but here we can not find cheese 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 half cure then this combination that I 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.370
 I like to do and now I'll put the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.370
 eggs one at a time 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.320
 to the Lord 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.500
 once everything is incorporated into the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.940
 day can start modeling do not need 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.470
 surfing this mark a lot because 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.930
 it's not your fault then we need 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.030
 develop in with a dough 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.630
 so just mix it up enough 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.370
 then start modeling moles 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.990
 I have here cuiabÃ¡ decided to cut in 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 Little pieces we'll use 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.709
 to put inside our bread 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.180
 cheese for modeling 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.450
 I like to put a little oil 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.709
 on the hand just do not stick too much and with help 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 of a spoon 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.120
 It's just polka dots I try to get a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.020
 measure more or less standard like this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.150
 a tablespoon not to have it all 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.910
 each one of a size as it enters more 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.400
 or less left in the same size but one 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.410
 hole in the middle of it all is that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.390
 put was killed the same day had 10 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 years reason do not confuse use 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.010
 necessarily guava can be done 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.110
 with front and presence filling or 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.380
 put cheese or anything 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.590
 this is just a suggestion that 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.070
 I like this combination nuno ribeiro 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.070
 I thought 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.110
 now just take the preheated oven to the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
 180 degrees for about 30 minutes 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.650
 or until it is lightly golden and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:34.510
 I did not change it and red bull 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:39.550
 I know how to do the episode and office unim de 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.990
