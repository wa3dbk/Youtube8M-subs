 of not doing so 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.630

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.650
 depending on the operating system that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.659
 have 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.750
 already with this said then we enter 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.860
 make the connection you already know the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.860
 way how to get 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.730
 well 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.180
 we enter and open the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:54.760
 we open the application on the phone 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.760
 tears on the phone is fine for 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.780
 and he tells me that he found is this is the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 name of my phone 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.100
 and click here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.640
 oh I forgot something here we have two 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.819
 connection types connection by usb and 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.300
 wireless connection via wifi 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.300
 I am using the connection via wifi 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.570
 and here we are teaching a screen 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.570
 virtual phone 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.160
 and here we can 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.410
 manipulate the phone 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.530
 inside this open screen like this 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.420
 as we were on a telephone in the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.550
 physical phone screen 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.180
 and we are going to open here to make a 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.180
 small demonstration 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.579
 same 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.070
 just like if we were 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.070
 on the physical phone 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.789
 another thing we can do here is 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.860
 transfer files from the computer to 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.449
 phone as the phone to the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.449
 computer and vice versa 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.900
 good 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.080
 this is basically everything I wanted 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.080
 to show 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.249
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.909
 and if you like 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.909

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.310
