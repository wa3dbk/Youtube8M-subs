00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.580
 Good, I would like to show here a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 blonde for you a victorinox pocket knife 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.029
 I just received a few days ago 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.859
 I exchanged with my friend in jose luis u 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 Rio de Janeiro friend from Rio de Janeiro 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.840
 I traded for a penknife opinion I 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.350
 had a pocketknife opinion number 8 in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.110
 carbon steel pocketknife 0 on the mainland 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 been used 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.219
 I confess that opinion was a mark of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.640
 pocket knife I thought I would go 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.340
 use more alone than I have in stainless steel 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.890
 which I also exchanged with another friend 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 Christian friend I have been using 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.410
 much he the penknife to his car he 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 I was very still so I decided 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 change this pocket knife the pinel for a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 Victorinox's pocket knife would be the one here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 the victorinox pocket knife and if he has 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 few solutions is a very good pocketknife 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 to come down that caught my eye 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 in this pocketknife 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.229
 until the fact that I accepted the exchange 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.030
 it was these wooden rooms I found 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.790
 very cool, very cool, I like 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.720
 different things in the two accessories and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.700
 said something that stands out is what left 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.140
 Yours and to be, let's say one with greater 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 personality 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.960
 this here is a basic victorinox is good 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 for anyone who wants to be discreet who does not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 feel in your pocket 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 so he has a blade a blade 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 normal size of the victorinox realize 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 which is an authentic victorinox is not well 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.509
 a copy or anything 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.509
 it came very well sharp excellent 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.950
 besides the main menu and still has this 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.520
 another piece here 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.110
 here we are three aggregate functions 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.810
 bare set a can opener 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.640
 and a medium size screwdriver 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.740
 great 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.160
 so here we already have a sound blade 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:34.450
 one three three functions the fifth and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.450
 sixth function of it 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.110
 its function is one that I added that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.830
 did not have that would be your little key 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.870
 here for whom sunglasses or 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.260
 degree as this is very useful here . 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 to tighten that screw to 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.340
 get loose 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.660
 grade glasses at work on my 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.330
 degree is weak 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.640
 Anyway, I still have to press 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.900
 both so much glasses of degree with 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 sunglasses 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.970
 the corkscrew also considers as a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.959
 another function now would be a two 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.280
 three four five six seven functions 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:22.160
 never nivet small like the one I have 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 here the victor inox when just 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.110
 to make such a comparison 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.320
 realize that there is difference also it 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.860
 would be a perfect knife to get down 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.870
 but I think he's very advanced 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.660
 pocket knife and victorino xxi when you 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.060
 puts them in their pockets without using a 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.310
 hanging clip and he would stay in the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 horizontal position in your pocket or 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.790
 make the volume then the one I used 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.950
 all day today 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.840
 he even gotten a little 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.510
 inclined only because he is a son and he 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.030
 Name (required) 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.070
 does not mean crusader in your pocket will 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.360
 that volume is something that does not 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.930
 very pleases 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.430
 I do not realize the blades at the joints 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:15.520
 victorinox blade up to slightly larger 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.229
 than than the new iPad model 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.549
 minimum thing that does not make much difference 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.490
 not really 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:28.909
 interferes with anything in the matter of weight 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.180
 a very significant difference 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:33.530
 this one is much heavier than the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.509
 twitter 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.270
 I really liked it and also noticed the 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.819
 difference of rooms if you do not have the 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.830
 victorinox symbol and what else is 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.690
 something for me does not make any difference to him 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.000
 also does not have the toothpick has no 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.470
 something that makes me a little lacking 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.800
 so I did not take it in the morning and it came down 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.060
 today the little victorinox classic all 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.810
 the scissors that has him as the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.759
 main breath 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 I used the two together and look 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.580
 which was very useful in some 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.139
 occasions two models of penknife and 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.060
 Victorino is called enough attention 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.159
 seem 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.889
 the first would be the compact I have 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.590
 a friend and commented on the channel that the year 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.870
 very interested in it some versions 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:24.069
 of the compact that the sea â€‹â€‹is interested in is 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:27.860
 the one with the pen and the clamp 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.900
 the pen and the pin 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.199
 besides these functions it has other 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.669
 basic functions good for them and this 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.779
 here too because it is too small and 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.479
 compact 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.099
 The basic function for me is to have a 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.050
 knife that blade with a blade 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.169
 teenager said that the strike some 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.120
 other functions which makes it 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.800
 very good, that's good to leave 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.919
 you and I loved it 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.580
 Thank you there, Luis, for accepting the 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.449
 exchange 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.110
 Thank you so much is that I will 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.520
 use with a certain frequency merits not 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.240
 is a tactical blade is a blade 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.830
 utility but I liked it a lot 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.080
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.080
 A big hug, see you later
