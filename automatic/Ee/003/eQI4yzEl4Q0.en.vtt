00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
varieties to grow them out to see how

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
varieties to grow them out to see how
they<00:00:15.570> will<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.870> not<00:00:16.080> only<00:00:16.290> here<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.009> Missouri

but<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.330> an<00:00:18.420> idea<00:00:18.750> how<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.410> grow

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
but to get an idea how they will grow

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.229 
but to get an idea how they will grow
and<00:00:19.830> produce<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.340> other<00:00:20.520> parts<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> North
