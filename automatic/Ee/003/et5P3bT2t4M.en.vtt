00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.829
 A washing machine is a great purchase so it is important to have a washing machine 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.869
 to buy carefully 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.660
 have different types and brand and these also vary greatly 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.419
 price 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.240
 that is therefore important for points 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 to watch out for when purchasing a new washing machine 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.609
 Firstly, you have the choice between a front loader or an above water 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 as the name suggests you could have a front loader there at the front 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.810
 put in the drum 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.010
 An advantage of a front loader is that it uses less water than one 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.780
 top loader 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.670
 with many models it is also possible to, for example, bark the bark and on top of the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.710
 local 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.040
 additionally load 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 the laundry can be put in from the top 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 these machines are often a different front loader 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.670
 the much weight of all washing machines can be read on, among other things 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 label of the machine 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.080
 then of course the bass result is important 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 this is indicated by the letter a to g 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.410
 here are 8 for the best quality 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 and cares for the least quality 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.549
 In addition, it is also important that was quite high when a machine comes 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.880
 bertus also about the possibilities of the centrifuge because as an environment you are allowed to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.940
 that are not centrifuged 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.470
 and dry result is also indicated by the letters patents with g 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.730
 and with regard to the tour money 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.930
 the higher this number, the higher the machine loads 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.829
 most washing machines we also have a separate program for hand washing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.400
 then you have to do the special evening was Noordin with the ground 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.110
 also for role there is a special full program on most machines 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 this way the training always stays in good condition 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.520
 the reservoir for the detergent should be cleaned regularly 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 so that any soap residue can be removed 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.259
 you must also keep an eye on exhaust capacity 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.379
 most of the modern washing machines I have had a thesis time of six kilos 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.440
 Some machines have a lot of key load 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 it is useful if you wash small amounts regularly 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.549
 most washing machines we are provided with the energy report umbrellas plus 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.999
 aad pers 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.759
 or b 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.759
 the hijackers plus cards are here most energy efficient 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.900
 some washing machines are equipped with so-called fazli introdans 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.439
 every brand has a different name for it 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.149
 this smart feature go kids for example the amount of water is 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.139
 the machine decides for itself whether to rinse again 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.009
 most washing machines have a positive stop 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:01.209
 this protected against flooding as soon as I leak inside or outside the machine 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.279
 arises 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.689
 and then ensures that the water supply is shut off 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.400
 this stop says master built in but also available separately 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.969
 the water hose through until the tap is connected and the sensor that it is under 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.239
 to be laid on the machine 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.079
 as soon as water leaks 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 give the sensor a signal and the water supply will be cut off 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.909
 Finally, a delayed start or time may be useful 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.519
 with a timer you can determine the start time yourself and the machine will then go on 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.829
 automatically on 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.419
 no this grow quickly 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.789
 You can read all the color specifications on the site from there 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:39.639
