 you do not know the king editor I'm going 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.029
 to explain a little bit of what it is about 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.710
 a guy who basically does not have to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.300
 think of a person be a famous a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.650
 actor a singer or whoever is more than 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.509
 think about this person and answering 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.639
 the questions to this guy this as a magician 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.900
 genius we can and the genius guess what 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.190
 characters we are thinking so not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.779
 let's have some fun watching this 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 guy called kim editor can decipher 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.150
 our staff we want to start 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 answer the questions and let's think 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 a character guys I say we 're going to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.029
 think about starting a game we always go 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.519
 to start with superman that we are going to put 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 his character is real that superman is not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 real is not real but it's a character 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 fictional his character is Japanese no no 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 it's Japanese is an animal not superman not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.090
 is an animal has ever appeared in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.829
 television if you see more I write in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.719
 television are people who fight against 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 the evil live in pieces like questions 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.200
 related to the character I do not know how 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.620
 they do it but if the kind of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.510
 character flies fly so obviously 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 if the character is wearing layers of that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 character and dresses from black black to new 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.170
 superman is white not pretty that blue with 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.760
 red yes with red on command character 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 He has black hair, I think I am 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.489
 sure is an agent has interpreted a 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.199
 Super Hero 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.520
 My character is a fucking superhero 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.070
 so if I think about that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.960
 to see guys if we think of a character 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.219
 this guy guesses it and that's how 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.259
 entertaining that we're going to think about another 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.850
 person let's see if you can guess me 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.070
 to me and let's see if in your base 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.539
 data is your knowledge about me like this 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.780
 that his character in the fight against evil 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.429
 He fought against evil I do not think so but 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.189
 in fact this day are youtuber but of 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.229
 I'm a hooligan night ok it's a movie 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.880
 is a real person if I'm real I think 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.409
 according to my mom her character is part 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 of the world of the song not that I know 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.670
 characters an actor 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.200
 let's say no because technically 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.340
 I'm not an actor because I think to be 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.720
 an actor has to be a movie and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.490
 still not just any movie so 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 not your character has any relationship 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.330
 with the world of sports 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.580
 I did not even dedicate me so his 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.320
 character has been passing for more than 30 years 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.820
 I am a young man and his character was made 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.110
 famous thanks to the internet 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.909
 his character has a dog 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590
 obviously I have to me the character 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.659
 It's Mexican, I'm not Mexican 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.290
 chile the boyfriend does not have his girlfriend 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.890
 character uses headphones 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.090
 your character is an animal like that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.410
 they are saying obviously I am not a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 animal your mother's son to the character 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.790
 has a brother if his character from usa 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 new character is Argentine not a 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.930
 Mexican character not a character 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.540
 appeared a video now I am German 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.920
 I appeared in 150 videos of Germanic nation or 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.330
 be not in a single video but we could 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.610
 say that if it appears in a video now 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.710
 I'm Germanic that has every mark for the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.720
 shaved head eye is not the shaved head 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.920
 is the capaza shaved not technically by 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 I was shaved for a while 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.610
 so we could say that if they study 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.050
 with the shaved head I think his character 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.370
 he likes dogs obviously if 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.870
 people who have a shaved head 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.610
 again there are at least they were 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.290
 ok head that's good yes yes 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.670
 I think that in genius if he puts 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.530
 talent there guesses the genius from time to time 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.820
 when you win wit see something we're going to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.440
 give another little money to the genius 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.630
 let's see if you can guess to me 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.370
 let's see if the genius knows mimÃ­ his 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.620
 character really exists or is there 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.300
 obviously my character really exists 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.010
 should your fame internet we could say 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.050
 that if you knew me in a short list of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.690
 character nation spain not what I 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.130
 know foreigner some pet is a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.170
 pet so I doubt you have a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.190
 pet so we could say that his 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.470
 character is an animal 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.210
 if your character is a dog your character 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.150
 appeared in a video of the sisters and 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.190
 his short character is thinner than me 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.050
 character has white hair does not have 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.520
 hair coffee and character is Mexican I do not 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.960
 me is not Mexican your character is a 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.710
 dog I already said yes and characters 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.390
 brown and obviously I think about myself 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.920
 genius is and he knew me because he sees me 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.480
 well fuckin famous and everyone the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.100
 you know or let's see if the genius 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.570
 can you guess my platonic love emma 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.130
 watson so let's watch videos 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.870
 on the internet, not on the video manual 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.240
 your character's internet existed 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 it really exists yet so I do not know to 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.800
 what do you mean it existed or does it exist 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.210
 or gay his character has children no no is 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.710
 more waston is a virgin, nobody touched him 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.390
 in life and the only person who is going 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.930
 to touch in life is me so no no 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.150
 He has children 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.010
 his character is singer the alicante in 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.180
 the shower but in real life do not follow 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.620
 the problem his famous character 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.960
 obviously if nobody would know him 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.670
 US character not in fact of the kingdom 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.770
 united so it's not Mexican no 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.990
 character nation spain managed characters 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.990
 actors characters novels 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.820
 the genius is already adducing that it is subject 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.380
 watson but let's say yes because 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.739
 obviously if the character is part 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.739
 of a trio 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.330
 by harry potter 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.250
 if I think about emma watson the genius if 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.020
 know the genius used in genius as 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.430
 that eliminates but like they sometimes give you 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.170
 the super weird questions so one 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.610
 has to like to pay attention to the 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.140
 questions but yes guessed emma watson 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.300
 let's continue in the next one that we're going to 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.070
 think of another character jack guys 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.900
 norris her character is a woman not what 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.400
 happens to you gentlemen is a macho man for 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.290
 the xove lugo character really existed 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.940
 obviously it is clear if it exists here not 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.740
 there are laughs of videos on the internet no sir 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.870
 does not make videos on the internet that I know of 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.040
 the famous character is so famous that the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.050
 moon is a character currently works 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.550
 in the world of sport not that I know 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.830
 character is part of the world of 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.320
 song but his character is an actor of 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.520
 person who is the person who has more 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.200
 40 years old 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.640
 I think it has technologies, I assume that 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.130
 yes you have to be over 40 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.320
 I guess his character is blond I remember 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.940
 if you're not blond or brown or something 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.710
 the truth I do not know the character famous for 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.240
 your physical strength 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.710
 the character belongs to the saga of 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.419
 terminator no character is a 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.620
 martial arts professional that is 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.720
 obviously a character has the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.650
 head shaved again with the head 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.030
 says head 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.650
 josep a Chernobyl does not have the head 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.040
 shaved so not her character is 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.040
 Portuguese 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.180
 120 to 500 and knows how to put talent there 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.439
 it puts talents and guys we are going to do 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.689
 let the genius guess the last character 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.550
 let's think about a character have 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.619
 fox okey megan fox his character is a 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.689
 actual person characters 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.129
 of the female gender if your character lives 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.539
 in the same country as you 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.860
 I would like to 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.899
 Unfortunately it is not a character gives 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.580
 concerts no megan fox does not give concerts 

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.619
 is not a singer the character has posed 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.419
 nude 

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:53.159
 I do not know if megan fox has posed nude 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.779
 sometime but if you have done it or brief 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.219
 the pictures I really do not know so I'm going 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.990
 to put alone I do not know because I'm not 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.249
 sure character has more than 30 years the 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.899
 I'm not sure, I do not think either 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.279
 you have megan fox has how he sold something 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:03.629
 but I do not know the truth is not a 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.520
 character to all famous movies 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.080
 and it came out in would transform into the turtles 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.119
 ninjas so if he is a superhero of 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.379
 marvel is not a superhero at all 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.089
 character is part of the saga of the 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.319
 Hunger games definitely not 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.089
 people who have black hair and 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.469
 they have black hair character appeared in 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.029
 a movie with robots if 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.069
 definitely if person who is 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.169
 someone close to Brad Pitt to those 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.789
