00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.649 

okay<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.150> down<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.849> computer<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
okay so down here is the computer to

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.009 
okay so down here is the computer to
open<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.700> recording<00:03:14.700> studio<00:03:15.000> there's<00:03:15.959> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
open up the recording studio there's a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.220 
open up the recording studio there's a
skill<00:03:16.680> book<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.359> right<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.780> computer

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
skill book to the right of this computer

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.619 
skill book to the right of this computer
but<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.709> guess<00:03:19.980> might<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.579> have<00:03:21.150> proct<00:03:21.510> an

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
but I guess might I have proct an

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.030 
but I guess might I have proct an
explosion<00:03:22.139> in<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.379> room<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.769> must<00:03:22.949> have

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
explosion in that room and it must have

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:33.339 
explosion in that room and it must have
moved<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.929 

so<00:03:34.349> inside<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.830> room<00:03:35.069> there's<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> safe<00:03:35.760> on

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
so inside this room there's a safe on

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.199 
so inside this room there's a safe on
the<00:03:36.030> wall<00:03:36.379> it's<00:03:37.379> not<00:03:37.439> much<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the wall it's not much in it and the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.350 
the wall it's not much in it and the
violin<00:03:39.629> is<00:03:39.870> over<00:03:40.349> there<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.129> far<00:03:41.489> back

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
violin is over there in the far back

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.800 
violin is over there in the far back
right<00:03:43.260> hand<00:03:43.560> side<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.010> room<00:03:47.599> so<00:03:48.599> pick<00:03:48.780> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
