00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.100
goodbye son

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
take with you dreams and hopes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.200
he will be an outcast

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.400
they'll kill him...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.100
how?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.300
he'll be a god for them...

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
what if a kid dreamed a different destiny rather than the one society assigned to him..

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
what if he aspirated to something bigger..?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.100
you're the answer to the question

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.000
are we the only one among the universe?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
can I continue to pretend that I am your son?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.200
you're my son

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.200
I have to believe that you're here for a reason

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.500
even if it takes your whole lifetime

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
you owe it to yourself to find out this reason

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320
how to find someone who hides his traces since his whole life?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for somebody he has been a guardian angel

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300
to others a ghost always misplaced

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.100
you'll give to earth inhabitants an ideal to fight

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.300
for they'll rush to follow you...they'll waver

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.200
they'll fall but with time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.300
they'll join along with you in the light...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
but with time...

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.000
you will help them to do wonderful things...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
do you think your son is safe?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.320
I'll be able to find him!

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.500
my father was convinced that if the world found out who I was

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it would reject me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
He was convinced the world wasn't ready

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.100
What do you think?
