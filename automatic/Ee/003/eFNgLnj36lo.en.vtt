 both microsoft and sony are 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.800
 betting on hardware architectures 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.530
 adventure and other action games 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.540
 genres that are not so good at playing in the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.000
 keyboard and mouse 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.310
 it would be better if you could already 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.210
 used joystick from your current console 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.640

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.979

 receiver for the wireless joystick that 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.799

 official xbox 360 joystick and pc 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.340
 this receiver we are enjoying and a 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.159
 unofficial product made in china 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.230
 however, it performs exactly the same 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.690
 functionality of the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.870

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.510
 rest assured about this the tcu welles 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.480
 The game is very simple. 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.660
 its package yesterday mc the company 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.470

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.060
 with your standard type usb connection 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.490
 indicates compatibility with the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.070
 windows 7 and earlier although the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.750
 installation is not very simple 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.210
 because the drivers are not 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.030
 and the installation will require 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.440
 that you very manually made the type 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.570
 device so that windows 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.850
 recognize correctly 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.340
 but do not worry about it until you 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.420
 you will surely find several videos 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.640
 on the Internet 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 teaching you how to install it is something 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.500
 already disclosed the product already has 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.630
 a fairly large car that reaches 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.820
 Williams is exactly the same as us 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.180
 when using joystick on the console 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.320
 or about eight meters and you 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.990
 will be in C 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.630
 after installation, simply tighten a single 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.970
 the sync button located on the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.130
 the top of the joystick and then 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.890
 button synchronism of own and silvia 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.440
 you will see an audible warning of 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.750
 joystick connection will appear there in the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.280
 your computer you will be able to check 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.650
 features on the control panel 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.630
 windows calibration options 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 will also be available if your 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.840
 control is a little worn with 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.520
 low accuracy 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.459
 that's where you'll calibrate 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.160
 it once detected on your computer 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 the vast majority of current and already 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.380
 mapped the settings to the west of the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.360
 xbox 360 and even changing the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.330
 information about the character 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.580
 buttons during the subtitles in the games that 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.410
 it's something pretty cool best practice 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.900
 this is the cost benefit 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.030
 the pc whose eyes can even be 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.370

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.050
 abroad and about thirty reais in 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.270
 National territory 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.050
 then considering the national price of 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.110

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.940
