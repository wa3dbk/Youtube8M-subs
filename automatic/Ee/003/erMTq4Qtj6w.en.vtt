 Thank you with your future 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 Let's start off with a pull pad as the type first and show off acrobatics 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.540
 It is not a channel 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:52.339
 In other words , let's work together Let's take an approach to share a pleasant hobby 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.329
 It will be a good channel so increase it to your beginners at the very beginning 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.290
 I think that will go 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.020
 This time the street of the company 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.950
 You can also do it and you can practice it even in reverence 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.320
 I think that acrobat channel is because boys watch in practice 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:11.240
 After all we share pleasant hobby 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.140

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.520
 Ah ah also because please dating is not 's that sense of 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.970
 That's not the meaning, I'm waving acrobat, I'm not that meaning 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 The 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.480
 I have is that gonna do acrobatics 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 Such that the first of Te 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:47.420
 pou dou dou's gonna be is here Dara Wu to Rothko Te' Tsu Poli 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:47.420
 pou dou dou Rosumatin waiting to Kusu' 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
 In other words , it is said to stop 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.570
 is 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.440
 I'm thinking about a victim 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.130
 Where gotten up to this wheel of fortune 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.910
 To align the foot it is a point set foot 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.910
 It is a bad boy 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.289
 A story about Higaki 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.840
 This is 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 It does not go out with a little good practice 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.630
 It 's like that until the other one 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.750
 This is 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.770
 It's good here, but if you get your feet all right here and do so from Lefranc 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.069
 I'm talking about 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.240
 Not 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:33.520
 And will count with the will to do so far is not here 's 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.390
 If I don't know what to do when I fall down, I'll have a back bite and say every day 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.420
 Because I am 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:43.120
 I guess it's okay if I get robbed in the first part , but I think it's not right here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.610
 There is a half-hearted but 7 there shaking Medellin 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.330
 And keep pace 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.850
 Align yourself with this line and then return 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.920
 Please say something to cause this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.770
 Located on the fourth floor 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.190
 About 10 times 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:05.240
 I think I was tired 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.410
 Say be up to the interval Come resting once 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.190
 Oh come now to the point 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:17.220
 But I is not to say what happens because the practice of this child 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:23.280
 First of all you have to support your weight For example, a word with something you want to do 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:29.160
 Come and put it on the ground , and if it is your weight, it's your wrists at first 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.580
 I think that this one and the auto below it and this 3 head aircraft will really really hurt the next day 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.220
 I will 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.260
 I think it will be the gold rate 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:41.180
 But it is important that you get used to acrobatic body little by little 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.820
 After those who say how much suffering to come selfishness After kicking around what it is that cut taste 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.350
 Hyo Jin from such practice was Nde come it takes Google's text rather than thinking in this head 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.980
 Let's go in 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.890
 Toka or heard, for example, biceps as long as it is prima facie 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:04.470
 If you put a cushion on the back where you might fall down 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.640
 I think of something I think of myself, but I practice the safety measures after children 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.760
 Please give me 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.420
 Let's do our best and wait for the next video .
