 good as we are mentioning it does 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.130
 while dog bites cat 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.450
 rats are like more common means than 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.059
 of humans except in one

 classic football game really good and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 what to do when we suffer one of these 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.600
 what to do in these cases for that to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580

 adriana soda welcome to adriana good 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.690
 this let's talk about the bites 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.010
 because it seems maybe there is memory but not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.559
 nothing could happen 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.360
 a bite can be very mild or very 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.340
 serious on what depends if the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 tissue if the fabric comes off 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 problem are going to be the hemorrhages and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 like any hemorrhage we should 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 learn to cover the bleeding when 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 a person is bleeding you have to do 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.320
 pressure on the wound first on the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
 wound to stop the bleeding if 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
 these gauze filled with blood not the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 go to remove grabs more gaza if 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 you put in because you remove the clot that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.339
 that way is now recommended 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.909
 have a plastic bag where you have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.920
 your gauze to avoid contact 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.170
 is a tourniquet is used when the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 hemorrhage is very abundant that the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.799
 can describe with direct pressure to 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 have a good bite the exception 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.710
 that there would be a great loss of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.420
 fabric in animal traction much more 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 large where the bleeding can be 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.219
 severe but let's imagine that you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.799
 they are working and windows of 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.899
 plastic not without having liked we have 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 this person who would just bite him if 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.219
 he went to claim the referee and one will 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.149
 bit aldo something that could happen in 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.649
 a football match 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.630
 ok ok that's the first thing you would do 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.789
 is bleeding if the blood is bleeding 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.250
 10 priority tiger beef 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.119
 we do what one does 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.560
 unconsciously them under running 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 water and now the first one because then 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.729
 Rivero was no need to have I 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.890
 I see that dinner goes there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.379
 everything is direct pressure ok the second 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.329
 would be the elevation and the third the 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:59.549
 indirect pressure below the line 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.129
 make pressure and finally a bandage 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.869
 compressive and then go to the doctor good if 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:05.340
 we have not come in hand or anything 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.789
 Well, with the first thing you find 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789
 you put one 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.750
 use a sock and what they do this 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 is the time it does not have good here is very 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.180
 important to stop the bleeding but in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.310
 a bite is very important to wash the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 eye wound with this was what I know the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.360
 award I answered you that a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.370
 hemorrhage is treated in that low way 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.130
 but if this person was bitten he 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.690
 shed the woven cat human dog 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.330
 that has bitten what is important is 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.170
 wash it there if the priority is to wash the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.050
 wound water to water jet gauze or a 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.490
 soap and we will wash the best 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.350
 that the wound can be 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.030
 today takes bleed and if you are bleeding 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.500
 this case that the cause of the injury was 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.050
 a bite you have to wash 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.150
 perfectly the wound is going to cover and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.030
 let's go to the hospital an open wound 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.740
 for a bite does not close does not go 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.550
 to saturate you should not know why 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.160
 do not 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.930
 is this in the hospital why why 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.270
 reason you have to leave it open 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 otherwise you can infect you knew 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.230
 you that a bite produced by a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.770
 human is the frequency that is higher 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.120
 get to infect that of a dog 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.280
 we have more germs in him more in the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.780
 mouth and it is more common that a bite is 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.930
 can infect that of human that of a 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 dog 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.040
 once the character of a friend and I 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.200
 came to bite a finger I nail the 210 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.090
 ten milestones we talk to the doctor and this one 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.620
 and the doctor because the risk of rabies 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.750
 you do not already know all the rodents can 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.250
 transmit it absolutely everything if to me 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.099
 It caught my attention that the doctor 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.319
 he asked me and I told him this blood 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.569
 you yes saints do not worry you do not 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.430
 you do not have to wear the rage 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.680
 especially when it's a dog and that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.480
 bites is very important that we see in the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.700
 video was bitten by a dog that we're going to 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.380
 do wash the perfect wound maynou the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.480
 garden or not water I have a hemorrhage 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.580
 severe here we are going to wash with water and 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.160
 perfectly perfectly soap now 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.560
 if the dog knows that he is a neighbor that 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.530
 is to see that he is vaccinated, to take care of 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.540
 dog also to see how he behaves 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.150
 here I was saving a lot the dog that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.560
 can have radio not so much but the form 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.319
 is um is a dog that has the time 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.180
 aggression of the dog looks at this nap 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.560
 more yes but what are we going to do first 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.430
 to wash 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.169
 and soap that although it hurts what's important 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.820
 is to remove the saliva the waste that is 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.270
 where is the risk of infection 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.550
 well let's wash perfectly and of 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.139
 outside we go to the hospital it's not going 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.880
 do not run out to the hospital first 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.280
 you have to wash the wound on the day of the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.040
 true not something sorry 5 alcohol does not kill 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.220
 hello good neis water and soap to the jet 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.540
 of water and direct workshop first yes no 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.010
 you go and put a good suture here 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.900
 is in theory I think that this injury was 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.880
 for another cause but a dog wound 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
 or a bite is not normally saturated 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.150
 initially see for housewives 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.650
 that you are not seeing there is a very 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.930
 common and that is between the little brothers 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.820
 they are playing, they fight and a little brother 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.669
 bite the other that should be a mom 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.040
 grab wash the wound perfectly 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.180
 water and soap and you have to carve it up 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.930
 to leave it as clean as possible 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.550
 then scold him 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.290
 let's say the wound a little silvio of 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.330
 bleeding if we see that it is deep there is 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.310
 to always go with the experts in the area 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.870
 of health that tells us why 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.630
 first thing that has touched me is that 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.130
 you put alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and then 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.350
 where only the resins are those 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.780
 they will cure you then in the case of 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.350
 Agrippina and resignation as a work 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.350
 of work 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.570
 the bites they gave us in the case 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.040
 when I was bitten by that I consider 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.600
 when I grew up I said the doctor does not owe me 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.980
 have said that if I bleed because the 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 saliva of the animal 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.250
 the one who said the fact when he bleeds 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.440
 People who do that the blood can 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.750
 vary that saliva if that's why it's said that 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.540
 blood is much better and I bleed water 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 soap and carve perfectly so I know what 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.990
 did my mom and I'm going to measure it 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.970
 take care of the hamster that you serve to complain if 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.470
 is aggressive that starts to salivate or 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.470
 that dies you have to go to the doctor 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.090
 if you have a hemorrhage and how 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.610
 we use a tourniquet very well 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.620
 thank you very much 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.659
