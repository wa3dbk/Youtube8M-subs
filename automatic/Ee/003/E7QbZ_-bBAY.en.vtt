it<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:07.790> $33<00:01:08.790> versus<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.830> $17<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> would

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it was $33 versus the $17 that I would

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.490 
it was $33 versus the $17 that I would
normally<00:01:11.430> play<00:01:11.760> pay<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> manicure<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.320> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
normally play pay for a manicure at this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
normally play pay for a manicure at this
particular<00:01:14.010> place<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.520> lot<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> places<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
particular place a lot of places you can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.100 
particular place a lot of places you can
get<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> manicure<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.340> $12<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.960> those

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
get a manicure for like $12 and at those

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
get a manicure for like $12 and at those
places<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.710> gels<00:01:19.920> tend<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> go<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.700> like

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
places the gels tend to go for more like

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.149 
places the gels tend to go for more like
$25<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.900> about<00:01:22.080> double<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.890> pay

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
$25 so it's about double what you pay

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
$25 so it's about double what you pay
and<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.299> interesting<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.560> they

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and it's interesting how they do it they

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.340 
and it's interesting how they do it they
put<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> whole<00:01:27.330> bunch<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.750> base

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

put<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.360> hand<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.470> machine

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
put your hand in this little machine

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
put your hand in this little machine
that<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> blue<00:01:32.549> light<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> counts<00:01:33.360> down

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that has a blue light and it counts down

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.569 
that has a blue light and it counts down
for<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> color

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
and you put your hands back in the
machine<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.110> probably<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.590> each<00:01:37.950> hand

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
machine so you probably have each hand

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
machine so you probably have each hand
in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> machine<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> say<00:01:40.170> three<00:01:40.380> or

in the machine I want to say three or
four<00:01:40.710> times<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> counts<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:43.140> what's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
four times and it counts down but what's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
four times and it counts down but what's
great<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:43.619> these<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:45.090> she's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
great about these is that when she's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.789 
great about these is that when she's

couldn't stand the feeling of it and she
picked<00:03:39.810> them<00:03:39.900> all<00:03:40.079> off<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.560> using<00:03:40.980> her
