one person who decides there is no one a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.290 
one person who decides there is no one a
choreographer<00:05:09.919> bullies<00:05:10.220> leave<00:05:10.940> less<00:05:11.120> for

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.240 
dance together and that was it basically
so<00:05:42.289> there<00:05:42.470> was<00:05:42.620> not<00:05:42.740> much<00:05:42.890> to<00:05:43.039> talk<00:05:43.190> about

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
so there was not much to talk about

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.159 
so there was not much to talk about
because<00:05:43.789> all<00:05:44.030> we<00:05:44.150> wanted<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.479> do<00:05:44.660> was<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.990> dance

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
because all we wanted to do was to dance

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.460 
because all we wanted to do was to dance
together<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.820> after<00:05:47.570> first<00:05:47.870> piece<00:05:48.080> has<00:05:48.260> been

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
together and after first piece has been

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.290 
together and after first piece has been
done<00:05:48.650> then<00:05:48.919> we<00:05:49.039> started<00:05:49.400> second<00:05:49.760> piece<00:05:49.940> where

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
done then we started second piece where

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.840 
done then we started second piece where
of<00:05:51.080> course<00:05:51.380> as<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:52.160> first<00:05:52.430> piece<00:05:52.640> has<00:05:52.820> been

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
of course as the first piece has been

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.820 
of course as the first piece has been
touring<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.479> we<00:05:53.810> had<00:05:53.930> certain<00:05:54.620> expectations

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
touring and we had certain expectations

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.430 
touring and we had certain expectations
we<00:05:55.820> started<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.300> compose<00:05:56.660> more<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.080> our<00:05:57.200> heads

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
we started to compose more in our heads

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.219 
we started to compose more in our heads
and<00:05:57.650> got<00:05:57.830> excited<00:05:58.310> by<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.520> years<00:05:58.970> ago<00:05:59.240> and<00:06:00.020> it

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229

and got excited by the years ago and it
became<00:06:00.440> more<00:06:00.680> difficult<00:06:00.890> so<00:06:02.080> some<00:06:03.080> curious

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
became more difficult so some curious

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.990 
became more difficult so some curious

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
experience of having not not caring at

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.570 
experience of having not not caring at
all<00:06:11.140> getting<00:06:12.140> a<00:06:12.230> lot<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.680> now<00:06:12.860> let's<00:06:13.250> see<00:06:13.370> now

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.060 

oh<00:06:28.790> but<00:06:29.790> you<00:06:30.210> know<00:06:30.240> in<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.720> end<00:06:30.750> in<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:31.560> final

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
oh but you know in the end in the final

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.580 
oh but you know in the end in the final
in<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.669> final<00:06:32.700> result<00:06:33.300> for<00:06:33.930> example<00:06:34.230> if<00:06:34.410> I

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
in the final result for example if I

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.320 
in the final result for example if I
dance<00:06:34.650> it's<00:06:35.160> not<00:06:35.340> only<00:06:35.460> that<00:06:35.639> fast<00:06:36.030> don't

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
dance it's not only that fast don't

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.659 
dance it's not only that fast don't
think<00:06:36.570> you<00:06:36.720> know<00:06:36.980> of<00:06:37.980> course<00:06:38.190> it<00:06:38.400> slows<00:06:38.639> down

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
think you know of course it slows down

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.420 
think you know of course it slows down
as<00:06:39.060> speed<00:06:39.150> up<00:06:39.419> it's<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:39.900> yeah<00:06:40.650> it<00:06:40.919> changes<00:06:41.340> the

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
as speed up it's a yeah it changes the

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.700 
as speed up it's a yeah it changes the
transforms<00:06:42.000> but<00:06:42.300> what<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:42.870> thought<00:06:43.110> well<00:06:43.410> why<00:06:43.680> I

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
transforms but what I thought well why I

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.500 
transforms but what I thought well why I
propose<00:06:44.160> it<00:06:44.280> to<00:06:44.310> people<00:06:44.669> is<00:06:44.820> when<00:06:45.060> they<00:06:45.180> decide
