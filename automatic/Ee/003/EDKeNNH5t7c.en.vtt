00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
investigation and actually made a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.710 

I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:54.489> it's<00:00:54.640> awesome<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.150> Rockstar<00:00:55.540> might

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.180 
I think it's awesome that Rockstar might
have<00:00:55.840> got<00:00:55.989> some<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.320> these<00:00:56.380> ideas<00:00:56.829> from<00:00:57.040> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
have got some of these ideas from the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.460 
have got some of these ideas from the
glitches<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.760> were<00:00:57.879> doing<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.840> like<00:00:59.020> inspired

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
glitches we were doing and like inspired

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.229 
glitches we were doing and like inspired
them<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.739> add<00:01:00.010> certain<00:01:00.400> things<00:01:00.579> at<00:01:01.059> certain

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
them to add certain things at certain

this body has been here for quite some
time<00:01:44.470> now

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
time now

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.859 
time now
but<00:01:45.520> not<00:01:45.700> long<00:01:45.940> enough<00:01:46.149> for<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.450> skin<00:01:46.720> to

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
but not long enough for the skin to

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.800 
but not long enough for the skin to
completely<00:01:47.259> decompose<00:01:47.920> off<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.460> bones<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.750> it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
completely decompose off the bones so it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.389 
completely decompose off the bones so it
seems<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.380> person<00:01:50.830> had<00:01:51.070> killed

recently<00:01:54.250> very<00:01:54.970> recently<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:56.259> let's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
recently very recently because let's

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.529 
recently very recently because let's
just<00:01:56.619> say<00:01:56.770> three<00:01:57.009> weeks<00:01:57.220> after<00:01:57.429> death<00:01:57.789> your

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
just say three weeks after death your

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.440 
just say three weeks after death your
skin<00:01:58.869> hair<00:01:59.200> nails<00:01:59.229> are<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.130> loose<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:01.240> they

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
skin hair nails are so loose that they

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.839 
skin hair nails are so loose that they
can<00:02:01.599> easily<00:02:01.899> be<00:02:02.200> pulled<00:02:02.619> off<00:02:02.830> so<00:02:03.459> this<00:02:03.640> body

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
can easily be pulled off so this body

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
can go it splits off at the debye you

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
can go it splits off at the debye you
can<00:03:34.560> go<00:03:34.650> left<00:03:34.830> or<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.130> know<00:03:35.310> right<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.850> they

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
can go left or you know right and they

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180 
can go left or you know right and they
both<00:03:36.390> lead<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.930> dead<00:03:37.260> end<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.710> makes<00:03:37.920> no

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
both lead to a dead end it makes no

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.860 
both lead to a dead end it makes no
sense<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.670> me<00:03:38.700> why<00:03:39.240> would<00:03:39.300> they<00:03:39.510> add<00:03:39.660> this

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
sense to me why would they add this

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.260 
sense to me why would they add this
whole<00:03:40.170> area<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.770> there's<00:03:41.520> nothing<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.240> here

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
whole area and there's nothing back here

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.690 
whole area and there's nothing back here
I<00:03:42.720> mean<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.290> awesome<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:44.160> they<00:03:44.310> added<00:03:44.610> this

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
I mean it's awesome that they added this

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.580 
I mean it's awesome that they added this
area<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.180> get<00:03:45.360> me<00:03:45.480> wrong<00:03:45.690> but<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.410> think

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
area don't get me wrong but I think

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.990 
area don't get me wrong but I think
there<00:03:46.740> might<00:03:46.860> be<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.070> little<00:03:47.370> more<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.790> this

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
there might be a little more to this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.480 
there might be a little more to this
area<00:03:48.300> but<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:49.050> again<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.590> said<00:03:49.650> before<00:03:49.860> I

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
area but then again like I said before I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.800 
area but then again like I said before I
could<00:03:50.970> be<00:03:51.060> blowing<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.450> way<00:03:51.630> out<00:03:51.660> of

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
could be blowing this way out of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.370 
could be blowing this way out of
proportion

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
proportion

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.110 
proportion
but<00:03:52.860> that's<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.280> that's<00:03:53.310> about<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.880> for<00:03:54.030> this

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
but that's it that's about it for this

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.520 
but that's it that's about it for this
video<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.570> wanted<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.020> really<00:03:55.200> show<00:03:55.470> you
