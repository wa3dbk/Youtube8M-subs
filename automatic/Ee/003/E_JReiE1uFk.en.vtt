to use Ableton Live and I hear a lot of

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.690 
to use Ableton Live and I hear a lot of
the<00:00:50.990> challenges<00:00:51.470> come<00:00:51.620> up<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.430> lot<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.580> the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
the challenges come up and a lot of the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.370 
the challenges come up and a lot of the
challenges<00:00:53.090> that<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.300> hear<00:00:53.630> are<00:00:53.810> people<00:00:54.140> going

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
challenges that I hear are people going

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.500 
challenges that I hear are people going
through<00:00:54.470> writing<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.040> tune<00:00:55.310> and<00:00:55.610> getting<00:00:56.120> stuck

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
through writing a tune and getting stuck

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.620 
through writing a tune and getting stuck
somewhere<00:00:56.810> and<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:58.370> reason<00:00:58.700> why<00:00:58.820> most<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.510> you

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
somewhere and the reason why most of you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.800 
somewhere and the reason why most of you
are<00:00:59.660> getting<00:00:59.930> stuck<00:01:00.200> is<00:01:00.440> because<00:01:01.100> there<00:01:01.700> is<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
are getting stuck is because there is a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.750 
are getting stuck is because there is a
specific<00:01:03.320> progression<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.220> writing<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.519> tune

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
specific progression to writing a tune

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.190 
specific progression to writing a tune
that<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.030> should<00:01:05.210> follow<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:05.990> step

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
that you should follow and if you step

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.890 
that you should follow and if you step
outside<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.980> then<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:07.730> going<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:08.180> cause

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
outside of that then it's going to cause

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.870 
outside of that then it's going to cause
a<00:01:08.930> lot<00:01:09.380> of<00:01:09.410> confusion<00:01:09.800> within<00:01:10.250> your<00:01:10.490> tune<00:01:10.670> and

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
a lot of confusion within your tune and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.940 
a lot of confusion within your tune and
you're<00:01:11.210> probably<00:01:11.360> going<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.750> get<00:01:11.870> stuck<00:01:12.140> so

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're probably going to get stuck so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.550 
you're probably going to get stuck so
this<00:01:13.100> dates<00:01:13.340> back<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.580> when<00:01:14.140> bands<00:01:15.140> used<00:01:15.470> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
this dates back to when bands used to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980 
this dates back to when bands used to
come<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.830> record<00:01:16.090> when<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.210> were<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> band

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
age sequencers like Ableton you would

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.500 
age sequencers like Ableton you would
have<00:01:24.230> to<00:01:24.470> pick<00:01:24.740> your<00:01:24.890> instruments<00:01:25.510> arrange

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
recording you'd give the tune to a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.790 
person with a different skill set and he
would<00:01:40.610> mix<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.090> tune<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.480> once<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.440> mixing

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
would mix the tune down once the mixing

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.950 
would mix the tune down once the mixing
was<00:01:42.950> done<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.820> tune<00:01:44.000> would<00:01:44.150> then<00:01:44.390> go<00:01:44.600> off<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> a

mix<00:02:02.960> down<00:02:03.140> stuff<00:02:03.500> before<00:02:04.460> you've<00:02:04.729> finished

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
mix down stuff before you've finished

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.030 
mix down stuff before you've finished
the<00:02:05.270> arrangement<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.900> tune<00:02:06.140> you're

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
the arrangement of the tune you're

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.180 
the arrangement of the tune you're
mixing<00:02:07.820> up<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.149> order<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.750> you're<00:02:09.560> creating

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
mixing up the order and you're creating

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
mixing up the order and you're creating
a<00:02:10.250> lot<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> conflict<00:02:10.940> within<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.270> tune<00:02:11.510> that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
a lot of conflict within the tune that

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.240 
a lot of conflict within the tune that
will<00:02:12.110> likely<00:02:12.500> prevent<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.010> from<00:02:13.040> getting

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
will likely prevent it from getting

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.410 
will likely prevent it from getting
completed<00:02:13.700> so

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
completed so

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.290 
completed so
so<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.680> way<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> view<00:02:16.130> music<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.790> opinion<00:02:17.150> is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
so the way I view music in my opinion is

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120 
so the way I view music in my opinion is
that<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.020> five-step<00:02:18.500> process

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
that it's a five-step process

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.050 
that it's a five-step process
there's<00:02:19.400> initial<00:02:20.000> sound<00:02:20.270> design<00:02:20.890> recording

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
there's initial sound design recording

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.150 
there's initial sound design recording
sequencing<00:02:23.060> or<00:02:23.239> arrangement<00:02:23.930> mix<00:02:24.620> down<00:02:24.860> and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
sequencing or arrangement mix down and

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.300 
sequencing or arrangement mix down and
mastering<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.530> those<00:02:27.530> should<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:28.040> gone

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
mastering and those should be gone

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.070 
mastering and those should be gone
through<00:02:28.730> from<00:02:29.239> one<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> other<00:02:29.780> without

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
through from one to the other without

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.840 
through from one to the other without
moving<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:31.340> back<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.580> the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
moving into one and then back to the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.199 
moving into one and then back to the
other<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.830> let's<00:02:33.830> take<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> look<00:02:34.130> at<00:02:34.250> an<00:02:34.640> example

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
other so let's take a look at an example

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.780 
other so let's take a look at an example
sound<00:02:35.900> design<00:02:36.230> that's<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:37.040> example<00:02:37.130> picking

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
sound design that's for example picking

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.729 
sound design that's for example picking
and<00:02:38.030> designing<00:02:38.330> your<00:02:38.480> drum<00:02:38.840> sounds<00:02:39.260> layering

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
and designing your drum sounds layering

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.530 
and designing your drum sounds layering
up<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:40.069> percussion<00:02:40.610> creating<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.060> drum<00:02:41.330> kit

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
up your percussion creating a drum kit

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110 
up your percussion creating a drum kit
it's<00:02:42.100> designing<00:02:43.100> what<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.489> bass<00:02:43.670> patch<00:02:43.940> is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
it's designing what your bass patch is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.670 
it's designing what your bass patch is
going<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> sound<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:44.660> picking<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.200> few<00:02:45.380> sounds

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
going to sound like picking a few sounds

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.100 
going to sound like picking a few sounds
is<00:02:45.769> like<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> painter<00:02:46.600> making<00:02:47.600> paint<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.050> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
is like a painter making paint on a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.229 
is like a painter making paint on a
pallet<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.739> choosing<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> colors<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.150> he's

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
pallet and choosing the colors that he's

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.090 
pallet and choosing the colors that he's
going<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> use<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.080> creating<00:02:51.590> your<00:02:51.709> pallet

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
going to use it's creating your pallet

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.410 
going to use it's creating your pallet
of<00:02:52.190> sounds<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.790> you're<00:02:53.030> going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.209> paint

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
of sounds that you're going to paint

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.350 
of sounds that you're going to paint
with<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.470> next<00:02:54.709> process<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.069> recording<00:02:55.670> now<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
with the next process is recording now a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.729 
with the next process is recording now a
lot<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.600> us<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:56.900> we're<00:02:57.049> writing<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.380> computers

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
lot of us if we're writing on computers

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.199 
lot of us if we're writing on computers
we're<00:02:57.920> not<00:02:58.010> actually<00:02:58.280> recording<00:02:58.790> using<00:02:59.120> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
we're not actually recording using a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.809 
we're not actually recording using a
microphone<00:02:59.630> in<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.959> studio<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.459> process

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
microphone in a studio but the process

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.610 
microphone in a studio but the process
is<00:03:01.940> similar<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.870> create<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> drum<00:03:03.410> kit

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
is similar if you create a drum kit

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.960 
is similar if you create a drum kit
you're<00:03:03.799> going<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.980> be<00:03:04.069> typing<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.519> MIDI<00:03:04.730> notes

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
you're going to be typing in MIDI notes

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.539 
you're going to be typing in MIDI notes
and<00:03:05.350> making<00:03:06.350> your<00:03:06.440> drum<00:03:06.709> pattern<00:03:07.100> that's<00:03:07.340> the

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
and making your drum pattern that's the

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.759 
and making your drum pattern that's the
same<00:03:07.730> thing<00:03:07.910> as<00:03:08.090> recording<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.500> people

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
same thing as recording the the people

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.259 
same thing as recording the the people
I've<00:03:09.890> seen<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.370> been<00:03:10.580> most<00:03:10.790> effective

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
I've seen that have been most effective

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.059 
I've seen that have been most effective
at<00:03:11.390> completing<00:03:11.720> music<00:03:12.200> what<00:03:12.590> they've<00:03:12.739> done<00:03:12.950> is

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
at completing music what they've done is

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.100 
at completing music what they've done is
they've<00:03:13.160> created<00:03:13.190> an<00:03:13.610> 8<00:03:13.790> bar<00:03:14.120> loop<00:03:14.180> where<00:03:14.900> all

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
they've created an 8 bar loop where all

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.660 
they've created an 8 bar loop where all
the<00:03:15.650> sounds<00:03:16.010> are<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.400> like<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the sounds are in there like the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.640 
the sounds are in there like the
absolute<00:03:16.970> peak<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> tune<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.080> big<00:03:18.260> drop

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
absolute peak of the tune the big drop

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.750 
absolute peak of the tune the big drop
that's<00:03:19.010> what<00:03:19.190> they<00:03:19.280> want<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.549> sound<00:03:19.670> like

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that's what they want it to sound like

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's what they want it to sound like
every<00:03:20.570> sound<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.109> there<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.440> an<00:03:21.590> 8<00:03:21.709> bar<00:03:21.859> loop

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
every sound is in there in an 8 bar loop

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.880 
every sound is in there in an 8 bar loop
and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.420> only<00:03:23.600> then<00:03:23.840> do<00:03:24.410> they<00:03:24.530> move<00:03:24.709> into

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
and then and only then do they move into

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.620 
and then and only then do they move into
the<00:03:25.040> arrangement<00:03:25.730> or<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.880> sequencing<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
the arrangement or the sequencing of the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.599 
the arrangement or the sequencing of the
tune<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.590> once<00:03:27.769> you're<00:03:27.920> complete<00:03:28.310> with<00:03:28.459> all

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
tune so once you're complete with all

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.160 
tune so once you're complete with all
your<00:03:28.640> sounds<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.299> figure<00:03:29.570> them<00:03:29.720> all<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:30.019> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
your sounds you figure them all out and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.720 
your sounds you figure them all out and
all<00:03:30.709> your<00:03:30.890> patterns<00:03:31.250> are<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.489> there<00:03:31.579> your

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
all your patterns are in there your

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.030 
all your patterns are in there your
recordings<00:03:32.299> been<00:03:32.480> done<00:03:32.660> then<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:33.709> can<00:03:33.859> move

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
recordings been done then you can move

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.250 
recordings been done then you can move
into<00:03:34.190> arrangement<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.060> that's<00:03:35.930> where<00:03:36.170> you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
into arrangement and that's where you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.289 
into arrangement and that's where you
lay<00:03:36.440> out<00:03:36.470> okay<00:03:36.799> here's<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.190> intro<00:03:37.579> here's<00:03:38.209> a

lay out okay here's the intro here's a

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.030 
lay out okay here's the intro here's a
breakdown<00:03:38.570> I'm<00:03:39.260> going<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.470> move<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.769> drum

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
breakdown I'm going to move this drum

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.819 
breakdown I'm going to move this drum
pattern<00:03:40.340> over<00:03:40.579> here<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.000> lay<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.329> out

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
pattern over here and you lay it out

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.520 
pattern over here and you lay it out
horizontal<00:03:42.829> wise<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.430> timeline<00:03:44.380> then<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
horizontal wise on a timeline then the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.110 
horizontal wise on a timeline then the
next<00:03:45.799> phase<00:03:45.950> after<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.609> complete<00:03:46.940> is

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
next phase after that is complete is

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.880 
next phase after that is complete is
mixed<00:03:47.420> down<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.810> mixed<00:03:48.170> downs<00:03:48.350> where<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.709> go

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
mixed down and mixed downs where you go

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.099 
mixed down and mixed downs where you go
in<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.280> polish<00:03:49.730> your<00:03:49.760> sounds<00:03:50.390> it's<00:03:50.840> where

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
in and polish your sounds it's where

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.990 
in and polish your sounds it's where
you'll<00:03:51.440> do<00:03:51.739> things<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.100> applying<00:03:52.430> reverb

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
you'll do things like applying reverb

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.990 
you'll do things like applying reverb
and<00:03:53.299> eq's<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.200> compressors<00:03:54.769> panning<00:03:55.760> things

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
and eq's and compressors panning things

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.640 
and eq's and compressors panning things
from<00:03:56.239> one<00:03:56.420> side<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.900> other<00:03:56.989> adding<00:03:57.530> in

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
from one side to the other adding in

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.460 
from one side to the other adding in
spatial<00:03:57.950> effects<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:59.239> if<00:03:59.569> you<00:03:59.870> try<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.260> do

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
spatial effects that if you try and do

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.870 
spatial effects that if you try and do
that<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.040> major<00:04:01.340> thing<00:04:01.640> I<00:04:01.730> see

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
that this is the major thing I see

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.210 
that this is the major thing I see
people<00:04:02.120> do<00:04:02.239> wrong<00:04:02.420> they<00:04:02.989> get<00:04:03.140> too<00:04:03.380> lost<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.950> mix

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
people do wrong they get too lost in mix

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.120 
people do wrong they get too lost in mix
down<00:04:04.459> before<00:04:05.450> going<00:04:05.810> into<00:04:06.049> arrangement<00:04:06.829> so

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
down before going into arrangement so

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.860 
down before going into arrangement so
they'll<00:04:07.310> get<00:04:07.430> lost<00:04:07.730> on<00:04:08.030> how<00:04:08.359> do<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.540> make<00:04:08.750> this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
they'll get lost on how do I make this

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.949 
they'll get lost on how do I make this
kick<00:04:09.140> drum<00:04:09.200> super<00:04:09.769> super<00:04:10.100> punchy<00:04:10.519> or<00:04:10.720> how<00:04:11.720> do<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
kick drum super super punchy or how do I

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.900 
kick drum super super punchy or how do I
get<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:12.319> lead<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.680> really<00:04:13.160> breathe<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.730> sit

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
get this lead to really breathe and sit

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.610 
get this lead to really breathe and sit
well<00:04:14.090> with<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.329> other<00:04:14.450> elements<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:15.049> know

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
well with the other elements you know

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.349 
well with the other elements you know
you<00:04:15.889> should<00:04:16.039> definitely<00:04:16.459> give<00:04:16.609> an<00:04:16.760> ear<00:04:17.180> to

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
you should definitely give an ear to

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.449 
you should definitely give an ear to
that<00:04:17.539> but<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.440> all<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.889> sudden<00:04:19.160> get<00:04:19.280> lost

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
that but if you all of a sudden get lost

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.810 
that but if you all of a sudden get lost
for<00:04:19.760> two<00:04:19.940> hours<00:04:20.239> any<00:04:20.450> cueing<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.989> synth<00:04:21.919> or<00:04:22.100> or

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
for two hours any cueing a synth or or

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.430 
for two hours any cueing a synth or or

putting compression and limiting on a
kick<00:04:24.680> drum<00:04:24.710> it's<00:04:25.370> going<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.640> prevent<00:04:25.940> your

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
kick drum it's going to prevent your

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
kick drum it's going to prevent your
creative<00:04:26.599> energy<00:04:26.960> from<00:04:27.200> moving<00:04:27.409> forward<00:04:27.620> and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
creative energy from moving forward and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.180 
creative energy from moving forward and
actual

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
actual

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.770 
actual
getting<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.550> structure<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.240> track<00:04:29.450> built

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
getting the structure of the track built

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.680 
getting the structure of the track built
which<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.260> important<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.490> only<00:04:31.820> after<00:04:32.150> you've

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
which is important so only after you've

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.270 
which is important so only after you've
finished<00:04:33.050> your<00:04:33.350> structuring<00:04:34.250> your

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
finished your structuring your

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.220 
finished your structuring your
arrangement<00:04:34.970> what<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> suggest<00:04:35.810> going<00:04:35.930> into

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
arrangement what I suggest going into

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.930 
arrangement what I suggest going into
mixdown<00:04:36.530> mode<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.980> once<00:04:37.370> you're<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.550> mixdown

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
mixdown mode and once you're in mixdown

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.290 
mixdown mode and once you're in mixdown
mode<00:04:38.860> complete<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:40.070> until<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:40.520> done<00:04:40.850> you

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
mode complete that until it's done you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.870 
mode complete that until it's done you
polish<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.900> tune<00:04:42.080> totally<00:04:42.590> then<00:04:43.160> export<00:04:43.850> it

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
polish the tune totally then export it

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.030 
polish the tune totally then export it
down<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> stereo<00:04:44.900> wav<00:04:45.140> file<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.770> can't

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
down to a stereo wav file so you can't

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.070 
down to a stereo wav file so you can't
mess<00:04:46.430> with<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.700> anymore<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.210> then<00:04:47.750> go<00:04:47.960> into

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
mess with it anymore and then go into

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.990 
mess with it anymore and then go into
mastering<00:04:48.560> mode<00:04:48.710> ideally<00:04:49.400> you'll<00:04:49.820> have

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
mastering mode ideally you'll have

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.910 
mastering mode ideally you'll have
somebody<00:04:50.390> else<00:04:50.570> mastering<00:04:51.140> your<00:04:51.170> tune<00:04:51.500> that's

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
somebody else mastering your tune that's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.530 
somebody else mastering your tune that's
