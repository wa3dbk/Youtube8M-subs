00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello everyone again 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.280
 dear friends my name is Sergey and we 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 continue to review fashion for skyrim 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.870
 and today we have another pack of weapons 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.760
 what did you want heaven forge here and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 actually today we have dogs weapons from 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.300
 famous games such as dragon age and i 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.779
 I will not give it looked with dark souls 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.880
 really 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 original swords already good me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 stay and therefore watch transfer 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 besides, many liked the weapon or 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.890
 tharks to master dragovic 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.680
 here today dragon age if you like it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 like the first sword first month 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 called in the custodian speaking help 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 Lamas wore short there is generally an ode 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.600
 tame 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 deals 66 damage so that you are not bad at 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 in fact for two handed even 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.739
 quieter enchanted with no 22 in principle 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 also quite normal and cost 3000 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 order to be pumped with you 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.860
 eloquence even the light battle ax 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.940
 War ash-handed weapon 21 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.090
 weighing 12 175 I remember too well 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.619
 as you can see the near view is also quite good 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.080
 against erase nice but just dragons 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.820
 it is not bad to be displayed to all species from 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.500
 first person sky and so good 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 rearranged more expensive there and not required 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.460
 even there is a little option on the table I do not remember 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 Such a dragonia can generally but damage 60 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 which is less by the way than its function 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 custodian weight 2 so that more than her 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 The cost of dwa-125 news is obvious that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 this hammer is worse than the first sword 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 feature of this that could and himself 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.540
 deals more damage due to the fact that 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.540
 they are slowing down the method 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.480
 so here it may be 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.190
 the wooden 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.120
 a special section has been added for it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.890
 wooden weapons also have a threshold and so 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.560
 blued blade at 1 23 weight 10 cost 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 300 this is already ours 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.230
 good kick and love loved more precisely 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.360
 weapons of this form are dragon age 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:03.240
 I really liked the original and also 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.030
 plain sword and grave stars 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.570
 the metal had its own skin and the same ones 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.179
 exactly 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.570
 modelki modelki heavy textures 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.570
 other 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.150
 In principle, it looks also very well and so 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.770
 you have another one that's the same as me 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.010
 I love only star metal too 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.390
 motorina too but textures tight 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.940
 there is also a grim sword kunari and then already 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.540
 old dragon age on screen bruised 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.100
 the horns will be i am america but you can see that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.550
 what is the study from the second part there 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.550
 stimuli 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.000
 smoke sword kunari too from the second part 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.000
 apparently docstring skin 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.110
 articles make it 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.180
 not 23 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.930
 5 principle standard for such weapons 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080
 from stock 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.110
 yes about business 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.740
 forever the same watched 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.740
 these 50 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.920
 a sharp power thread addition on 13 with 3 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.109
 worth 45 though it looks like a sword but 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.950
 nonetheless for some reason this dagger is not 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.560
 know the dagger in short about the dragon 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.689
 steel two-handed sword 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 in short dutch to thunder such a sword 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:23.370
 cool actually I did not leave right now 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.469
 help even very, I do not know who 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.349
 to taste those that is you like with 2 what 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:30.450
 dangle then the floor in skyrim is the most 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.849
 the best option so I advise you to download 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.980
 those who leave with two-handed swords 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.019
 is empty on purpose then if rather mpower yourself 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.530
 manual ignorance here they are not really 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.819
 like a dragon steel long sword he 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.010
 as well as the previous one only 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.060
 Option I am of course another model that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.689
 I basically like it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.790
 damage by the way 23 weight 12 home from 2400 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.829
 the previous one also did not look at 66 as 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.040
 the very first weight is 24 too 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.530
 nature more than 5000 well needed 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 the dagger of kunari is worth a lesson for 17 years 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.780
 twenty five tenths cost 35 well 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.819
 actually damage his dagger want to say 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.759
 even quite good though the cost 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.479
 not enough weight nevertheless 25 he's like 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:14.579
 as if throwing a bow dressed up 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.970
 the stars of unity who gave the network mod 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.590
 I do not know what yet a father receiving 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.340
 no arrows bad but not shooting 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.949
 anyway so here it looks but 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.400
 the sample is still good though I can not 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.900
 say why not 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.850
 she instills a fight to bargain today 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.100
 most likely all standard animations 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.550
 Steregu therefore there is nothing new I tell you 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.039
 won't show or messianic ball for 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.990
 view lesson 60 visa 400 m out of 500 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.509
 actually it is not the best variation 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.919
 the sword that we saw in it packs well 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.220
 or also not bad in principle 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.919
 well although it cannot be otherwise 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.620
 steel dagger and actually what 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.289
 will agree quite well about can 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.570
 so empty but in any sochi were secretly 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.800
 original for skyrim and for even 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.580
 dragon age 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.889
 kept a very original 5 divisions of bodies 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.250
 boards two-handed ball deities language 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.250
 you break 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.289
 actually that's how it looks by the way 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.000
 There is a second sword of the same model but 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.660
 was seen from what materials he 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.660
 forged 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.759
 so well give already inspect 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.919
 decorated vile in his hammer it if 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:40.510
 what we add on with the same mod but not 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.849
 less it is rather something really from 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.099
 The road from Karim than dragon age yes 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.610
 okay well let's 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.699
 hostinsky big hammer in principle 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.349
 level 66 which is a good idea windows 8 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.510
 for someone cost 300 well then what 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.909
 last weapons well, please note 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.060
 what is actually forged here too 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.990
 from different materials and the stronger 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.909
 property and smoking and weapon order 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.639
 more you have to fork out 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:09.159
 materials or spend more time 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.570
 mines or mining them somehow else well in 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.169
 overall that's all for today dear 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:18.130
 Friends hope you enjoyed it and yes a little 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:22.000
 don't forget we have another mod now 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.560
 called the race of the dwarfs so expensive 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.840
 friends and gnomes to be honest jack 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.940
 they are just like the people just 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.310
 a little bit lower but let's read 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.560
 for in them 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.270
 a little bit different story yet gnome 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.370
 also known as the best warrior of 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.930
 skyrim and smiths skyrim thanks 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.940
 hardened life in the mountains they appeared 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.650
 immunity of magic is also the most gifted 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.420
 the lock can sometimes use it 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.450
 most of them love loneliness and 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.910
 release in general, here are such gnome and 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.220
 they look like not just small 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.400
 muzzles but know I still like 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:07:04.290
 for it's cool they're just less of course 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:06.420
 here and no doubt but the existence would make them 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:11.010
 really a bit thicker like this 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:14.160
 already more or less gnome well here and here 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.470
 in fact they are dwarves a little bit 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.320
 actually changed those who love there 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.770
 play for exactly gnome play those 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.280
 can actually play for them 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:28.040
 even for those for not cool in general 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.120
 any such here that's for sure 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.000
