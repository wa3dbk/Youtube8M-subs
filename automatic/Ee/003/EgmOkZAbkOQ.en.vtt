that you play games on I mean I could

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
that you play games on I mean I could

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
literally shove this under a door and it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.580 
literally shove this under a door and it
would<00:01:48.210> prop<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.659> open<00:01:48.780> other<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
would prop it open other than the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
would prop it open other than the
inconvenience<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:50.850> having<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.270> fold<00:01:51.509> and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
inconvenience of not having it fold and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.289 
inconvenience of not having it fold and
its<00:01:51.869> portability<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:53.100> weird<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.060> mean

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
its portability it's just weird I mean

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
its portability it's just weird I mean
it<00:01:54.390> looks<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.899> designed<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> leap

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
it looks like it's designed like a leap

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.679 
it looks like it's designed like a leap

I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> design<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.009> they

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
I just don't like the design that they

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.100 
I just don't like the design that they

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
chose it's cheaper because now it

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
chose it's cheaper because now it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
now with the design I really don't

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040 
now with the design I really don't
that's<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.849> personal<00:02:30.330> opinion<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.870> it
