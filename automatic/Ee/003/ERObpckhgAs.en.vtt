00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.609
 Y 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 China has more than 1300 million 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 inhabitants approximately half live 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 in the cities the government foresees that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.110
 another 300 million people 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 become urban citizens here 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.669
 to 2030 how this process is organized 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.960
 of how the apartments are built 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.880
 how much water and electricity is consumed 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 what type of transportation is used and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.080
 how the waste is processed will depend 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.269
 the future of this country and the world about 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.680
 150 kilometers outside of Beijing 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.000
 is raising an experiment that deals 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.019
 to find answers to these questions 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.760
 the ecological city of stores this is 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.170
 one of the sustainability projects and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 of environmental protection more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 advanced throughout the country through a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.870
 agreement signed in 2007 between the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 government of singapore the chinese government 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.629
 it was decided to start this project that still 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.449
 it's only around 30 to 40 per 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.420
 hundred completed the completion of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.820
 the whole set is planned for 2020 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.930
 behind me you can see the model 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.880
 of the project 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.780
 the buildings that are blank are 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.030
 those that have not yet been 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.670
 constructed and transported colors are 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.930
 those that have already been completed today we are going to 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.810
 know some of the people who manage 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.580
 the project and let's see how is the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 whole of this ecological city of 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 tianjin accompany us 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.330
 do not 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.259
 one 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.620
 ah 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.800
 course 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.790
 just a decade ago this area located 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.170
 next to the sea was a wasteland the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.420
 surrounding factory poured 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.920
 freely your industrial waste the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.440
 land was too salty and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 symbolically contaminated the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.410
 authorities chose a piece of land 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.970
 devoid of life to erect a 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.100
 project that is modeled after 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.240
 more sustainable form of organization one 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.400
 of the key points of the city 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.770
 ecological in waste management 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 the goal is to waste less so 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.530
 that a strict 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.750
 separation system collected and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.520
 recycling of garbage there is also a 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.590
 waste pre-processing system 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.820
 not reusable the responsible 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.540
 they assure that by this technique 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.000
 they diminish 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.920
 90% the amount of garbage they must 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.269
 transport to landfills and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.269
 incinerators from the surrounding 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.770
 the ecological city of tianjin is not a 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.599
 reserved for rich the prices are 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.640
 they place at around 120 thousand euros for one floor 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
 of 100 square meters more or less what 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.310
 same as in other complexes 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.860
 residential areas of the outskirts of Trentino 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.319
 There are also numerous peking 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.489
 free community facilities 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.100
 authorities foresee that the city 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.920
 shelter about 350 thousand residents in 2020 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.060
 but this goal is still far away 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.700
 now 10,000 have been built 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.940
 apartments of which 65% are 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.250
 sold and only 30% inhabited zooming 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.540
 in one of the pioneers we found 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.819
 down the street and kindly access 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.620
 show us your residence where you live 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:56.290
 for two years with her husband and my 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.290
 family or I got where they call it 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.940
 one 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.280
 but that animal 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.039
 the philosophy behind the city 

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:54.099
 Tianjin ecological system is based on 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.449
 two principles consume fewer resources and 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.149
 minimize the impact on the environment 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.989
 environment of the consumption of those resources 

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:01.300
 good example is the system of 

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:02.559
 heating and cooling all 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.629
 apartments have installed a 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.279
 piping circuit under the ground in 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.499
 summer circulates cold water and in winter 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.149
 hot water regulating the temperature 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.129
 of the building the system is 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.239
 completely centralized the water is 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.619
 Warms up or cools in a huge 

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:17.559
 plant that feeds to a large extent 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:19.809
 of wind energy the objective is that in 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:21.129
 2020 at least 20 percent of the 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.269
 energy that is consumed in the city 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.239
 comes from renewable sources 

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:26.739
 mainly the wind and the sun to 

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.209
 the Asian country is essential to look 

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:30.069
 solutions that increase the quality of 

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:32.079
 life of the population without depleting the 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.389
 environment the ecological city of 

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:35.860
 Tianjin is a first step an experiment 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.689
 which is being used as a model for 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.399
 other urban developments the 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.079
 technologies that are tested are then 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.479
 replicated or discarded in others 

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:45.189
 projects depending on their performance 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.329
 for friends of your energy on testing
