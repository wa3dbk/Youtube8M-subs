00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello friends of the fans welcome to dvd 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.340
 Review my further trailer check and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.620
 though to the new film by darren aronofsky 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 with none other than russell crowe 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.559
 in the main role and the whole in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.960
 biblical extent 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.960
 And we are looking at noah 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.910
 only what did he say he wants the world 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.910
 destroy 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 and there is no recognizing the one 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 often violent people and there a 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.160
 bad about the world that's why you have to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.710
 wipe us out 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.370
 the torrent comes we build a ship 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 for the innocent 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.230
 What do you want, did you really think so 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.990
 you could protect yourself from that in front of me 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.850
 it is not about the protection in front of you me 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.210
 stand with my people and you are 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.430
 alone and will resist me 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:25.690
 I'm not alone because they come 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.690
 she desperate and in great numbers 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.020
 everything that creeps and snakes 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.020
 fleucht 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.899
 just think he did not choose you without 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.899
 reason 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.429
 It is in the hands 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.399
 it begins 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.610
 I would say light and shadow 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.989
 I do not quite know what I mean 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 but should keep this trailer 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.260
 history of noah is clear in the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.330
 The order is given by god one 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.190
 it will be a torrent to build an oak 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.110
 go from each species a little man and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.300
 weiblein to save that's basically 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.550
 the simple reason story almost 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.800
 Every child knows and all this here 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.330
 packed in blockbuster look 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.950
 the paramount pictures only brings us 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.680
 expected from the third april 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.000
 2014 in German cinemas and next 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.830
 russell crowe as only one main role 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.239
 are jennifer connolly doing anthony 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.160
 hopkins emma watson the one or the other 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.959
 other familiar face and you could 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.489
 almost say aha the whole thing could be too much 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.739
 the twelve are just great 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.810
 Blockbuster cinema would not be suitable 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.100
 Remember that ski as a director 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.780
 thereby the fighter among other things of 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.739
 film like black swan as a director or 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.600
 also the wrestler 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.220
 he has his own kind of things to do in 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.750
 scene and that's why I'm not yet 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.640
 sure what I think of this trailer 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.410
 should and think that he also a lot more 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.120
 Can be as a whole lot 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.220
 waves of water lightning and a ship too 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.989
 show and russell crowe in the middle because 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.190
 he is one of the often not only 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.319
 for all this stupid movies 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.700
 ok signs movies like robin hood 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.470
 filming can be there as critical 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.239
 on the other hand , though, that still exists 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.040
 one or the other argument behind the 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.900
 Lets say backdrops could be good during 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.340
 I do not know about the trailer yet 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.140
 a bit too flat for me but I am 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.459
 curious what you say even if I 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.750
 In any case, this strip from me 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.579
 the third april 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.019
 and yes already like the comments from her 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.519
 I think of the trailer then I am 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.510
 curious what the second trailer deliver 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.280
 Will he be a little more ? 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.019
 Characteristic background delivers that 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220
 I would at least wish and then 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.290
 that was in my short little one now 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.700
 trailer check to noahs can be 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.989
 thumbnail made it stay that way 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.670
 not like because you mean now 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.049
 movie reviews or bed on facebook 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.400
 over but a bit over 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.930
 companies want to write or not 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.579
 this or my two-channel if you 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.560
 do not miss any videos from and with me 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.419
 let it stay if it does 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.979
 but you decide tomorrow at 15 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.609
 clock is the latest here a new 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.680
 Video 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.350
 until then I hope to say again 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.350
 of course 3
