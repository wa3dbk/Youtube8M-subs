you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.590> could<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> six<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> eight<00:00:29.580> seed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you know we could be a six to eight seed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
you know we could be a six to eight seed
in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> East<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.869> obviously<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.410> tough

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
in the East you know obviously the tough

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
in the East you know obviously the tough
schedule<00:00:32.340> early<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> season<00:00:33.110> prevented

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
schedule early in the season prevented

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
schedule early in the season prevented
us<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.230> getting<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> good<00:00:34.950> start<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
us from getting off to a good start and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.950 
us from getting off to a good start and
things<00:00:35.760> didn't<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.090> come<00:00:36.390> together<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
things didn't really come together the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
things didn't really come together the
way<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.140> had<00:00:37.440> planned<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.250> can't<00:00:38.940> say<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
way we had planned so I can't say a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
way we had planned so I can't say a
month<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.960> quite<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.290> optimistic<00:00:40.680> but

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
month into it is quite as optimistic but

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
month into it is quite as optimistic but
going<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.309> actually<00:00:41.520> felt<00:00:41.790> pretty<00:00:41.820> good<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going in I actually felt pretty good and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
going in I actually felt pretty good and
when<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> month<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.590> maybe<00:00:43.739> two

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
when you are a month in and maybe two

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
when you are a month in and maybe two
months<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.520> even<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:44.940> Rajon<00:00:45.329> Rondo<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
months in even when Rajon Rondo is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
months in even when Rajon Rondo is
traded<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> Dallas<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:47.280> Jeff<00:00:47.520> Green<00:00:47.789> goes<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
traded to Dallas when Jeff Green goes to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
traded to Dallas when Jeff Green goes to
Memphis<00:00:48.860> obviously<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> talent

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
to feel like there was a little

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
to feel like there was a little
something<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.939> were<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.270> within

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
clearly running away with those spots so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.050 
clearly running away with those spots so
you<00:02:08.160> start<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.489> yeah<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.940> there

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.780 
it and obviously when we added Isaiah to
the<00:02:15.450> mix<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:16.740> changed<00:02:17.130> everything<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.640> then

the talent we need but we think we've

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.010 
the talent we need but we think we've
laid<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> good<00:06:36.420> foundation<00:06:36.480> and<00:06:38.480> that<00:06:39.480> we've

got a really good opportunity to take a

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.880 
got a really good opportunity to take a
big<00:06:42.300> step<00:06:42.450> up<00:06:42.780> whether<00:06:43.140> that's<00:06:43.320> this<00:06:43.620> summer

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
big step up whether that's this summer

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.040 
big step up whether that's this summer
or<00:06:44.250> you<00:06:45.210> know<00:06:45.240> throughout<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:45.660> course<00:06:45.870> of<00:06:45.990> the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
or you know throughout the course of the

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.080 
or you know throughout the course of the
season<00:06:46.260> you<00:06:46.620> know<00:06:46.710> remains<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.190> be<00:06:47.220> seen<00:06:47.490> but<00:06:47.730> I

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
season you know remains to be seen but I

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.580 
season you know remains to be seen but I
think<00:06:48.240> there's<00:06:48.390> a<00:06:48.450> lot<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.600> optimism<00:06:49.200> that

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
think there's a lot of optimism that

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.820 
think there's a lot of optimism that
will<00:06:50.220> continue<00:06:50.550> you<00:06:50.850> know<00:06:50.910> an<00:06:51.180> upward<00:06:51.510> trend

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
will continue you know an upward trend

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.530 
will continue you know an upward trend
and<00:06:52.830> I<00:06:53.040> think<00:06:53.460> you<00:06:53.730> know<00:06:53.820> it's<00:06:54.000> it's<00:06:54.180> somewhat

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
and I think you know it's it's somewhat

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.790 
and I think you know it's it's somewhat
justified<00:06:54.720> I<00:06:55.080> think<00:06:55.350> we're<00:06:55.470> a<00:06:55.500> little<00:06:55.590> bit

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
justified I think we're a little bit

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.080 
justified I think we're a little bit
further<00:06:55.920> ahead<00:06:56.160> of<00:06:56.280> plan<00:06:56.520> at<00:06:56.700> this<00:06:56.760> point<00:06:56.850> than

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
further ahead of plan at this point than

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.880 
further ahead of plan at this point than
we<00:06:57.150> thought<00:06:57.330> we'd<00:06:57.510> be<00:06:57.690> but<00:06:58.380> I<00:06:58.410> also<00:06:58.620> think

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
we thought we'd be but I also think

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.350 
we thought we'd be but I also think
there's<00:06:59.040> no<00:06:59.220> resting<00:06:59.610> on<00:06:59.730> the<00:06:59.790> merits<00:07:00.060> I<00:07:00.120> think

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
there's no resting on the merits I think

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.510 
there's no resting on the merits I think
you<00:07:00.510> know<00:07:00.630> we<00:07:00.810> know<00:07:01.110> that<00:07:01.860> what<00:07:02.040> worked<00:07:02.250> for<00:07:02.400> us

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
you know we know that what worked for us

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.400 
you know we know that what worked for us
this<00:07:02.730> year<00:07:02.790> was<00:07:03.210> you<00:07:03.540> know<00:07:03.660> was<00:07:04.020> hard<00:07:04.260> work

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
this year was you know was hard work

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.040 
this year was you know was hard work
right<00:07:04.740> it<00:07:04.920> was<00:07:05.070> being<00:07:06.030> hard<00:07:06.300> to<00:07:06.450> play<00:07:06.630> against

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
right it was being hard to play against

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.040 
right it was being hard to play against
right<00:07:07.230> it<00:07:07.380> was<00:07:07.500> being<00:07:07.710> prepared<00:07:08.090> and<00:07:09.090> I<00:07:09.840> think

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
right it was being prepared and I think

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.630 
right it was being prepared and I think
we've<00:07:10.170> got<00:07:10.290> to<00:07:10.380> continue<00:07:10.530> to<00:07:10.830> do<00:07:11.160> all<00:07:11.430> those

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
we've got to continue to do all those

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.580 
we've got to continue to do all those
things<00:07:11.700> infuse<00:07:12.600> a<00:07:12.630> little<00:07:12.930> bit<00:07:13.020> more<00:07:13.140> talent

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
things infuse a little bit more talent

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.130 
things infuse a little bit more talent
into<00:07:13.860> the<00:07:13.950> roster<00:07:14.400> and<00:07:15.240> a<00:07:15.330> couple<00:07:15.600> key<00:07:15.810> spots

into the roster and a couple key spots
