I<00:00:32.969> didn't<00:00:33.239> plan<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.200> felt<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
I didn't plan on it I felt like that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
I didn't plan on it I felt like that
would<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> moment<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.059> would<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
would be the moment that would be the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.340 
would be the moment that would be the
most<00:00:37.710> boring<00:00:38.540> when<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> perform<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.200> new

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

most boring when you perform your new
stuff<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.980> feel<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.550> festivals<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> time

stuff I feel like festivals are a time

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.029 
stuff I feel like festivals are a time
to<00:00:44.120> sing<00:00:45.120> along<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.410> grab<00:00:46.710> people's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to sing along and to grab people's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
to sing along and to grab people's
