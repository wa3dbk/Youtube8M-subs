00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello to you sasha today we 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.370
 so here is a wonderful little white 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.340
 bunnies from paper it is from version 1 on 8 or 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 2 sim 1 I don’t know for sure, but here you are 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.490
 asked him to do it i did 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.650
 really did 1 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 why because and for some reason 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 other colors that is, I found a rabbit 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.980
 only rich to share gray as yet 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 just left 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.590
 Bunnies come to play, so now I'm 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 I go to another rabbit and find only this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.120
 white rabbit imagine 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.040
 In general, in general, so I thought I decided not to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 get upset getting started despite the fact that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.170
 he is an albino I don’t really like them 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.750
 but pretty pretty came out like that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 white rabbit with red eyes I decided 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.309
 not upset and make it nice 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.309
 came out at least a little clumsy 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 let's talk about him a little bit 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 difficulties to build ok 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 her intelligence takes only one A4 sheet 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.370
 these pretty few yuki that he himself 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.350
 rather small 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.129
 here if u put to death here 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 one cell is one centimeter me 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.610
 a board, that is, here it is , see how well 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 he is well here 5-6 centimeters that's what he 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.100
 by itself it is small right there 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 from a rectangle tail 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.530
 rectangle head too rectangle 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 spout square is all rectangles 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 here here itself heavy here 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.280
 here's his legs , you see, they come in 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 right in the body here here they are seen 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.700
 right in the torso are there everything 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.070
 marked stay like all allowances 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.810
 there is sticks very conveniently if 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.409
 changed to stick these lower ones 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 boilers do have the support legs, they just 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.670
 here are the rectangles and need 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 just glue and hold and that's it 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 Now that they are frozen in this position 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.700
 This business probably stick and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.619
 front wing of the building in the same front 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.360
 so that the back of the storm well, at least at the level 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 You will see that I have the back 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 a little higher than its front legs 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.659
 because of this a little bit like that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.540
 clumsy get accuracy as I do not know 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.890
 some kind of horse without blood 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.619
 should more like this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 sit I do not know how to do it can 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 to be the opposite here you need me 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 write or somehow and I do not know in general that 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.900
 the picture for which he did so 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.659
 nice as a rabbit if you close 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
 except so here she sits like a horse 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.640
 such a m will be like this to improve 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.430
 by the way when you do and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.900
 forget the nose I forgot the nose 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.540
 Then I looked on the Internet and I think 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.129
 damn i have to be nose i did it with 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.500
 a gap there in a couple of days just 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.720
 started doing abandoned then continued 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.310
 I think where did his nose take the brave 100 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.970
 until this nose has found water for you 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 this little penny is also not 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.500
 forget that he has a tail passes 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.750
 already forgot the tail is the same in English bale 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 faces in general every time I 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 forgetting 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.450
 cufflinks orchid is the tail as well and immediately 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 that is what I thought then and where he you 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.799
 to stick 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.349
 This is the reason that I abandoned him 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.200
 bail and then continued to pretend that 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.760
 you are natalya 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.159
 our great expert in English therefore 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.720
 and so he you are just that small therefore 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.950
 a little inconvenient to glue but in general it 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.290
 I came out quite well 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.829
 here only on the nose a little smeared a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.620
 so even higher in my not bad 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.230
 unity that is ugly what answer 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510
 black everywhere is that white white 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.389
 the rabbit is marked all black, that is 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.639
 usually on black whites such here 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.829
 on the contrary its from the beam somehow by trim i 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.049
 tried to trim but vedic but also 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.780
 ugly turned out and let the paint like 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.940
 would white yuan than paint except but 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 it was not until the only minus 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.079
 so bunny do very easy me again 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 stretched the video for almost four minutes 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.250
 they just want a little rabbit and us 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.190
 also want to do go make 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.870
 the same rabbit and look here by the way 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.620
 I forgot to say he has a head like this 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.019
 like this like this 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.000
 like that, but I don’t know how it is 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.919
 define because on it too 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.139
 Itself as well as paws here these here on everything not 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.239
 cretan one glue holding on then I 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.590
 that's just stuck the bottom part 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.530
 could pierce 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.599
 and so and so and so in general then if you 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.209
 glue pva then I don't know if you can 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.560
 so do especially if glue a pencil 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.260
 because well there can not be like this 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 enough captivity 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.310
 and so she kept so 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.010
 then advance it to think if 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.740
 I do not make such a rabbit stenosis 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.630
 like it but nothing at all 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.340
 get all the necessary links as well 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.290
