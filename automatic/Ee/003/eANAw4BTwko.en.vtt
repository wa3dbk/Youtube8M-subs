00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
melt you know the fish is starting to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
melt you know the fish is starting to
think<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.369> eating<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.029> getting<00:00:21.449> ready<00:00:21.630> for

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
think about eating and getting ready for

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
think about eating and getting ready for
the<00:00:22.020> spawn<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the spawn but the first thing I do is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.980 
the spawn but the first thing I do is
start<00:00:23.609> feeding<00:00:24.119> heavily<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.869> what

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
start feeding heavily and this is what

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
start feeding heavily and this is what
we<00:00:25.050> call<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> pre<00:00:25.500> spawn<00:00:25.740> pre<00:00:26.310> spawn<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> when

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
we call the pre spawn pre spawn and when

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
we call the pre spawn pre spawn and when
the<00:00:26.939> fish<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.210> basically<00:00:27.599> eating<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.960> much<00:00:28.230> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the fish are basically eating as much as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
the fish are basically eating as much as
they<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.800> put<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.220> weight<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> spawn

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
they can to put on weight for the spawn

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
they can to put on weight for the spawn
and<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.990> good<00:00:31.170> baits<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:32.040> in

anywhere from seven to ten so these are
good<00:01:16.080> things<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.619> about<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.009> some

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
good things to think about you know some

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
good things to think about you know some
days<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> fish<00:01:17.909> might<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.270> off<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.750> bit

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
days the fish might be off a little bit

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
days the fish might be off a little bit
deeper<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.500> anywhere<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:19.979> five<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.460> ten<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
deeper you anywhere from five to ten and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.910 
deeper you anywhere from five to ten and
sometimes<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:22.049> might<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
sometimes they might be right up on that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
sometimes they might be right up on that
bank<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.549> depending<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> fish<00:01:25.020> are

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bank so depending on where the fish are

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.240 
bank so depending on where the fish are
you're<00:01:25.439> gonna<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> the

you're gonna have to get out of the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
you're gonna have to get out of the
experiment<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.240> depending<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.750> where<00:01:28.020> what

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
experiment but depending on where what

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
experiment but depending on where what
water<00:01:28.710> column<00:01:29.159> they're<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.430> during<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> day

first off for it to scratch you have to
go<00:02:50.550> through<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> UV<00:02:51.210> protector<00:02:51.750> which<00:02:51.870> is

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
go through the UV protector which is

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.510 
go through the UV protector which is
really<00:02:52.260> hard<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.740> then<00:02:52.860> get<00:02:53.070> down<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
really hard to do and then get down to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.950 
really hard to do and then get down to
the<00:02:53.610> paint<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.270> it's<00:02:54.450> double<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> protection

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
the paint so it's double the protection

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.230 
the paint so it's double the protection
than<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> normal<00:02:55.860> bait<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.700> color<00:02:56.970> just

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
than a normal bait and the color just

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.660 
than a normal bait and the color just
lasts<00:02:57.570> really<00:02:57.870> long<00:02:58.050> these<00:02:58.980> two<00:02:59.220> baits<00:02:59.460> right

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
lasts really long these two baits right

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.460 
lasts really long these two baits right
here<00:02:59.820> I've<00:02:59.910> had<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.270> over<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.510> year<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:00.810> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
here I've had for over a year now and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.350 
here I've had for over a year now and
I've<00:03:01.590> caught<00:03:01.860> fish<00:03:02.130> on<00:03:02.310> them<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.610> honestly<00:03:03.150> I

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
I've caught fish on them and honestly I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.000

there but these pretty much look like a

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.960 
there but these pretty much look like a
new<00:03:07.050> bait<00:03:07.290> these<00:03:07.800> lasts<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.250> lot<00:03:08.490> longer<00:03:08.550> than
