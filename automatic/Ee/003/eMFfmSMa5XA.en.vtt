00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.519
 4 today we will have a full class 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.539
 watch yourself seven times 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.679
 integral 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.839
 too much but kubica dx 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.169
 let 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.909
 measured by square root of x good the first thing we are going to do for 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.640
 that there were such 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.079
 before integrating 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.060
 would not pick up a signal that integration 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 with the degree of 11% 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.240
 but proved to take 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.290
 he reserved that to resolve this root that taking the country out of the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 more with the body of the grandmother repeated judge 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.130
 notes that here it has an exponent that is the number one 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.020
 so when you do not have anything in here you said it's number one 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.640
 so in the root place I'm going to put a power 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.580
 where these chains that come up here are now easy 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.750
 and this one this index comes down here 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.130
 then that is the same thing that is waiting for a third 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.270
 then high school credit 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.030
 It's the same thing they were out of the country. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.980
 means that you try to choose between those who enter from the bottom out 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.940
 for 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.260
 records that enters from the bottom is outside the padilha that enters by formatting from below 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.760
 about the same thing as me 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.680
 Who out there is kindle 2? 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.950
 the square root of x is the same thing that is taken to the grave medium 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.750
 who enters underneath to have two is out that is the index 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.550
 so the squad of the judge is the same thing that is taken in half 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.250
 well do not integrate now that I'm going to do I'll get it 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.500
 I'll apply here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.930
 the definition of power division 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.910
 division of power of the same base 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.350
 repeats the base of this deadlines because of course 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.000
 it is here that Leticia 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.340
 the base here in nex same letter 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.799
 so when you have a division a division 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.839
 and muffled the same letter x divided by six 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.129
 sew and tighten the stylist that the base 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.439
 this brings me exponent the exponent that is a third 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.819
 you'll subtract the half hour how easy it is 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.019
 so every time you have 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.079
 a division 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.439
 of powers of the same base repeats peace and subtract the Spaniards 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.769
 so you will have 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.939
 one-third - the middle then will stay 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.349
 integral 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.420
 integral 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.790
 of one also last night integrate no more 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.739
 xix 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.549
 as subtracting from the powers 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.810
 I have a third - in the middle commented on back point 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.099
 for the president is a fraction must have the same denominator as the denominated 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.149
 that excerpt called either can not subtract in that format 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.030
 fraction 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.169
 with an indifferent denominator 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.389
 so you take the minimum or so as they are cousins ​​you 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.029
 multiplying by indent 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.130
 three times two 6 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.010
 repeating 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.289
 three times two 6 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:20.720
 she puts you 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.059
 heinz will get the 6 will split by the bottom 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:32.609
 6 david for three tension will divide 6 david and for three give 2 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.109
 the result multiplies by the top two times 1 nóis 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.149
 they will repeat 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.829
 6 now split because for two put in the proceeds 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.719
 if you will have 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.989
 six divided by that 2/3 multiplied result cent by the top three times 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.499
 between them 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.309
 kisses 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.759
 Look, there's no full training left in crack stone. 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.659
 an 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.729
 more shrapnel lifts current 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.729
 2-3 is one less 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.909
 repeating 2-3 - or 6 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.869
 let 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.869
 and now that you do now yes we will integrate 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.729
 the time to reintegrate into a constant 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.430
 the one-year integral 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.409
 is the number times x 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:31.289
 then integral of one is a green x has degree of 2 p2 x has gain of 3 and 3 x 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.349
 fourth rail 4 x so integral of one will be a judge that the same thing as 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.370
 exist 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.760
 mazzola work of athlete eduardo uram on the federal senate more 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.539
 the integral of a power said that it does not tell the story 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.539
 it's a power you repeat the bars comes 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.129
 shaken I've been watching 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.499
 I've been here it has nothing to do with us. 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.229
 and if it is integral with an audi a1 x tarr 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.759
 to integrate the high team minus 6 is a power 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.919
 repeats the base 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.739
 and I pick exponent who is the exponent that he - said jeferson 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.620
 easy word 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.190
 pedro exponent only hand down here you will put the result too 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.659
 so let's add here 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.199
 six times one of six 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.830
 -1 5 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.990
 let's repeat 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.300
 how do I add a fraction to the whole world? 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.650
 the contest had a negative fraction but worldwide 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.150
 just take this number from below 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.100
 and multiply by this 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.339
 always multiply how easy it is 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.020
 six times or 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.639
 6 after having suddenly boycotted its content 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.680
 six times 1 6 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.900
 -1 5 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.940
 5 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.710
 Baskets then got the ball 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.569
 answer will stay tigers 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:56.830
 more 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.099
 up today 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.669
 6 times a 6-1 5 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.999
 6th 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.479
 about who it is 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.809
 5 6 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:10.430
 na ice 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.169
 the constant said 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.069
 the German only make this division that begins to divide and in mathematics 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.439
 remember 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.050
 dvd trade 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.850
 repeat from above 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.310
 and multiplies by the investor lowers then the booklets 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.550
 images 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.210
 it is near the top had decided to take the field 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.349
 5 6 points 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.860
 times 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.939
 inverts from low universe of 5-over 6 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.559
 I thought about 5 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.240
 so you're going to have to do the following 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.740
 but the constant c 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.939
 sherry 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.159
 I wish I had taken 5 6 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.469
 every time you have a power and those pollutants with a fraction 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.080
 this is a root 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.889
 backyards before 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.860
 Aries 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.939
 whoever enters will demand this from you 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.430
 who's down 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.610
 It's out of time now, it's a joke, who's in the folder outside who's more 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.960
 only six then aids 26 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.430
 Who's upstairs is inside. 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.260
 then x high 5 600 is the same thing as the decisive basket root 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.279
 led to which 5 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.330
 multiplied by what 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.080
 6 500 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.830
 but constancy 

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.210
 shore mary 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.800
 every time you join you are required to vote it is not the result of 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.740
 constant 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.220
 why solved the problem until the next
