Europe and then better you always go
back<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.390> your<00:02:25.510> base<00:02:25.660> in<00:02:25.840> Switzerland<00:02:26.349> yeah

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
back to your base in Switzerland yeah

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.150 
back to your base in Switzerland yeah
that's<00:02:27.580> basically<00:02:27.730> like<00:02:28.090> where<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:29.010> spend<00:02:30.010> most

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that's basically like where I spend most

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.030 
that's basically like where I spend most
of<00:02:30.340> my<00:02:30.400> time<00:02:30.549> when<00:02:31.090> I'm<00:02:31.239> not<00:02:31.269> racing<00:02:32.040> simply

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
of my time when I'm not racing simply

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.110 
of my time when I'm not racing simply
because<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.670> middle<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:33.940> Europe

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
because it's in the middle of Europe

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.080 
because it's in the middle of Europe
it's<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.660> easy<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.610> racetracks

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
it's so easy to get the racetracks

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.789 
it's so easy to get the racetracks
because<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.540> only<00:02:37.720> an<00:02:37.870> hour<00:02:38.019> by<00:02:38.319> flight<00:02:38.620> to

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
because it's only an hour by flight to

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.039 
because it's only an hour by flight to
most<00:02:39.010> places<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.120> very<00:02:40.239> central<00:02:40.750> that's

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
most places so it's very central that's

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.069 
most places so it's very central that's
really<00:02:41.319> nice<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> be<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.220> Switzerland<00:02:42.629> only<00:02:43.629> or

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
really nice to be in Switzerland only or

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.420 
really nice to be in Switzerland only or
you're<00:02:44.290> excited<00:02:44.799> because<00:02:44.950> there's<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.310> many

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you're excited because there's so many

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
together

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.559 
together
um<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.019> think<00:03:11.680> last<00:03:12.130> year<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.670> was<00:03:13.090> good<00:03:13.329> enough

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
um I think last year was was good enough

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.500 
um I think last year was was good enough
to<00:03:13.630> prove<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.829> Lotus<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.519> had<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.970> results

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to prove to Lotus that I had the results

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.660 
to prove to Lotus that I had the results
and<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.079> ability<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.250> program

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and the ability to get in the program

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.259 
and the ability to get in the program
it's<00:03:19.359> simply<00:03:19.930> because<00:03:20.099> Lotus<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.790> junior

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
it's simply because Lotus and the junior

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.870 
it's simply because Lotus and the junior
program<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:23.139> can't<00:03:23.380> apply<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.609> so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
program you can't apply to be in it so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.270 
program you can't apply to be in it so
they<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.389> pick<00:03:25.569> even<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.049> head<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:27.040> it's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
they have to pick even the head so it's

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.940 
they have to pick even the head so it's
really<00:03:27.430> nice<00:03:27.700> that<00:03:27.760> they<00:03:28.299> came<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.989> said<00:03:29.709> that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
really nice that they came and said that

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.430 
really nice that they came and said that
you<00:03:30.069> were<00:03:30.190> part<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.669> program<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:32.290> was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
you were part of the program and it was

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.319 
you were part of the program and it was
really<00:03:32.620> cool<00:03:32.889> because<00:03:33.130> Eric<00:03:33.579> buhay<00:03:33.940> was<00:03:34.180> the
