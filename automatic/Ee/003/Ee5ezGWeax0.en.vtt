00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.919
 friends, hello, we are in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.380
 hospital clinics 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.870
 nothing special is just 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 once a year as if there is insurance 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.880
 pass all examinations but such as 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.189
 annual survey here I finally 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 chose time 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 I found a doctor and I need a long time 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 looking for a doctor because they kind of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.529
 Doctors automatically appoint you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 if you haven't chosen for a while 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.329
 the doctor and I have appointed a woman 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.920
 mexican we somehow know me in general 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:43.219
 I didnâ€™t really agree with that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.769
 very lucky that in this clinic 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:53.820
 working doctor how could he say 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:57.570
 it seems like not Russian and not American 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.519
 because well, how can we say that to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.850
 Congress was written that was born 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 I think I do not remember where that's in Russia 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.380
 but Jewish nationality is the last name 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 he has a Schwartzman 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 and he has been living in america since 10 but now 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.940
 of course the person is already there already 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.640
 sixty maybe maybe a record from 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.179
 I do not know for sure, probably for 60 all the same 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.170
 here and natural education he 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.789
 got here in america that's why and on 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
 and the most important factor of course for me 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.490
 which it was what he says on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.590
 Russian 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.720
 That's why general, I chose this 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 Dr. Perry made it out to them for a long time. 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
 general that he took me because 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 he was already recruited a certain 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 the number of patients in general is she we 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 made a request what exactly indicated 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 the main reason for what it says 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.759
 in Russian, in general, and so I 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.750
 lucky that he was, he still took me here 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.750
 so what are you sitting now that 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.590
 in general, we left you already with my reception 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.990
 Dr. I really liked my doctor 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.960
 cool so nice man to him like 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.750
 I said far beyond 60 well for 50 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 of course he lives here all his life already 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 10 years and very good by the way yes judging by 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.670
 Russian speaks very well without 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.940
 accent well, so words are sometimes spoken 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.160
 some forget of course that's our general 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.850
 then everyone liked it now we go 4 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 he said 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.250
 he has four Russians 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 patient i was very surprised here and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 now we go to play if you want 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.660
 You can immediately go for blood analysis. 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.360
 but cover them but it burns we will 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.840
 everything absolutely everything everything check everything there 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.600
 and sugar and challah washed and, in general, all that 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 you can and can not be well, so that's it 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 here 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.520
 I paid what I called as edited 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 it is well as a deduction up to 60 dollars and because 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.560
 in general, this money comes back 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.420
 here and now we go there it is them 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.130

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.840
 waited for giving 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.870
 Well, not so long, well, forty minutes waited 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.540

 America that you sit always expecting even 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.459
 If you scheduled time anyway, 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.870
 then you sit and wait unclear how much 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.510

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.870

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.470
 okay right now, someone choose shorter 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.220
 we decided to have a snack and naturally here 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.720
 So here is the menu prices such as 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.870
 like probably mostly everywhere to me 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.950
 I liked that they wrote here what 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.919
 they use no hormone hormone with beef 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.780
 look written 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:39.669
 without hormones here I chose myself 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.870
 now we have lunch so I chose myself 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.850
 scrambled eggs do not know see what happens 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:53.430

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:03.910
 I understand once show you a little bit how 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.220
 Looks like a restaurant to a USB flash drive 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.370
 but in general, for us potatoes 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.440
 here is considered a restaurant because 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.090
 waiters serve well and how i 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.460
 said if the dishes are more or less 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.920
 decently it means already a restaurant but in 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:27.820
 mostly of course here is a pastry shop 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:31.060
 the coolest and so brought us our 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.090
 food here so here is my crazy omelet 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.670
 get off the killer portion just how well 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.710
 Usually this is how Sonya looks like 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:47.980
 what the hell is this why 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:54.250

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:55.830
 and pate and nuts and so pure 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.510
 french snack 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.760
 but we all bon appetite afterwards 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.720
 let's say well, of course, dessert is still a dormouse 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:12.460
 before the ships or not see there let's say 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:16.650
 how much money I'm shooting 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:20.949

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:23.770
 very tasty and very these things this 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:27.310
 like brownies but tastier they are gold like 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.690
 as if sprinkled with yummy bit 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.690
 try to say drop
