that<00:05:30.199> this<00:05:30.289> look<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.590> pretty<00:05:30.830> wearable

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
that this look is pretty wearable

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.010 
that this look is pretty wearable
especially<00:05:31.909> considering<00:05:32.389> that<00:05:32.419> it's<00:05:32.690> blue

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
especially considering that it's blue

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.379 
especially considering that it's blue
and<00:05:33.259> blue<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:34.279> color<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.669> I<00:05:34.879> personally

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
and blue is a color that I personally

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.360 
and blue is a color that I personally
find<00:05:35.779> a<00:05:35.930> bit<00:05:36.050> difficult<00:05:36.409> to<00:05:36.680> wear<00:05:36.889> sometimes

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
find a bit difficult to wear sometimes

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.399 
find a bit difficult to wear sometimes
so<00:05:38.060> yeah<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:38.449> was<00:05:38.569> everything<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:39.050> had<00:05:39.229> to<00:05:39.289> say
