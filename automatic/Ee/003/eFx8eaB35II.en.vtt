was<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.799> Sacramento<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.369> nine<00:01:05.549> years<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
was with Sacramento for nine years so I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
was with Sacramento for nine years so I
was<00:01:06.689> very<00:01:06.750> used<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.010> class<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.280> gave<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
was very used to the class they gave I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.230 
was very used to the class they gave I
was<00:01:09.150> used<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> however<00:01:10.439> horses<00:01:10.799> were<00:01:10.950> run<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
was used to however horses were run so I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.420 
was used to however horses were run so I
felt<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.540> comfortable<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
felt very comfortable and then when you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.950 
felt very comfortable and then when you
come<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> new<00:01:15.060> atmosphere<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.780> there's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
come into a new atmosphere and there's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
come into a new atmosphere and there's
different<00:01:16.290> personalities<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> think

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
different personalities and I think

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.160 
different personalities and I think
everybody<00:01:18.330> worked<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.659> each<00:01:18.810> other<00:01:18.990> very

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
everybody worked with each other very

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
everybody worked with each other very
well<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> certain<00:01:20.939> transition

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
well but there was a certain transition

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.480 
well but there was a certain transition
just<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> myself<00:01:22.770> getting<00:01:23.070> comfortable<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.960> I

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
just in myself getting comfortable and I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
just in myself getting comfortable and I
what<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.880> liked<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.990> being<00:01:28.799> able

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
what I really liked was that being able

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.050 
what I really liked was that being able
to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> ballets<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:31.100> such<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.640> perform

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to do the ballets for such we perform

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.510 
to do the ballets for such we perform
them<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.659> for<00:01:34.470> such<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> period<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.250> time

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
them so much for such a period of time

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
them so much for such a period of time
to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.729> able<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.600> take<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> ballet

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to be able to really take the ballet

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
to be able to really take the ballet
from<00:01:37.680> when<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.070> choreographed<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> feel

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
from when it was choreographed and feel

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.940 
from when it was choreographed and feel
comfortable<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> point<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> performing

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
comfortable to the point of performing

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
comfortable to the point of performing
for<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.130> first<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.000> feeling<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for the first time and then feeling it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.200 
for the first time and then feeling it
transition<00:01:43.049> from<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> first<00:01:43.560> performance

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
transition from that first performance

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.120 
transition from that first performance
through<00:01:45.210> however<00:01:45.720> many<00:01:46.079> performances<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.950> did

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
through however many performances we did

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.719 
through however many performances we did
and<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.439> deepened<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and just how much it deepened that was a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.980 
and just how much it deepened that was a
really<00:01:50.970> nice<00:01:51.590> experience<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
really nice experience and I think to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990 
really nice experience and I think to
from<00:01:54.990> starting<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.470> Trey<00:01:55.890> he<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.640> wanting

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
for example compared to a classical

ballet
a little<00:02:04.600> bit<00:02:04.720> more<00:02:04.840> presentational<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.920> a

a little bit more presentational and a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.340 
a little bit more presentational and a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
stories were more ethereal it was a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.130 
stories were more ethereal it was a
little<00:02:10.869> bit<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:13.000> was<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.510> different<00:02:13.690> it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
little bit it was just different it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.270 
little bit it was just different it
wasn't<00:02:14.530> human<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.670> superhuman<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
wasn't human it was superhuman and the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
didn't realize that that was such a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.510 
didn't realize that that was such a
special<00:03:02.470> moment<00:03:02.860> for<00:03:03.070> me<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.610> also<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.810> theme

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
Dylan come in there are a couple of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.100 
Dylan come in there are a couple of
moments<00:03:08.320> where<00:03:08.620> we<00:03:08.650> found<00:03:08.980> new<00:03:09.280> point<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.600> look

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
moments where we found new point to look

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.620 
moments where we found new point to look
at<00:03:11.260> each<00:03:11.380> other<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.209> makes<00:03:13.450> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
at each other and that just it makes it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.690 
at each other and that just it makes it
feel<00:03:13.750> like<00:03:13.810> Oh<00:03:14.140> something<00:03:14.709> new<00:03:14.890> happened<00:03:15.370> and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
feel like Oh something new happened and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.060 
feel like Oh something new happened and
then<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.780> don't<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.380> energy<00:03:17.739> carries

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
then I don't know that energy carries

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.790 
then I don't know that energy carries
through<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.580> think<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.900> tend<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.290> go<00:03:20.470> in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
through I think that we tend to go in

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.820 
through I think that we tend to go in
stages<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:23.080> come<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.470> another

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
stages and it you come up to another

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.300 
stages and it you come up to another
level<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.489> then<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:26.170> continue<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.920> grow<00:03:27.130> and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
level and then you continue to grow and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.530 
level and then you continue to grow and
then<00:03:27.430> maybe<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.760> feels<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.209> plateaued

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
then maybe it feels like you plateaued

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.750 
then maybe it feels like you plateaued
until<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.380> are<00:03:29.680> able<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.160> figure<00:03:30.310> out<00:03:30.550> how<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
until you are able to figure out how to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.850 
until you are able to figure out how to
get<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.120> next<00:03:31.180> level<00:03:31.450> again<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.830> I

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
get to that next level again and so I

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.770 
get to that next level again and so I
feel<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.390> one<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.570> those<00:03:34.720> times

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
feel like this is one of those times

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.120 
feel like this is one of those times
where<00:03:35.200> i<00:03:35.260> was<00:03:35.380> able<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.680> come<00:03:35.830> up<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.100> a

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
where i was able to come up to a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.350 
where i was able to come up to a
different<00:03:36.400> level<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.700> start<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.150> feel<00:03:37.330> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
different level and start to feel the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.900 
different level and start to feel the
growth<00:03:37.690> i<00:03:37.959> had<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.160> small<00:03:40.620> well<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.700> wasn't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
growth i had a small well it wasn't

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.520 
growth i had a small well it wasn't
small<00:03:43.239> i<00:03:43.390> shouldn't<00:03:43.900> say<00:03:43.930> small<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:44.500> i

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
small i shouldn't say small but i

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.130 
small i shouldn't say small but i
thought<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:44.980> i<00:03:45.040> was<00:03:45.130> going<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> retire<00:03:46.140> from

i<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:24.540> i<00:04:24.630> told<00:04:24.870> him<00:04:24.990> i<00:04:25.260> need<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.890> think<00:04:25.920> and

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
i think i told him i need to think and

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.160 
i think i told him i need to think and
then<00:04:27.120> i<00:04:27.210> thought<00:04:27.390> four<00:04:27.630> maybe<00:04:27.780> five<00:04:27.870> minutes

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
then i thought four maybe five minutes

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.810 
then i thought four maybe five minutes
after<00:04:28.470> talking<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.070> him<00:04:29.160> on<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.310> phone<00:04:29.400> and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
after talking to him on the phone and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120 
after talking to him on the phone and
that<00:04:30.090> was<00:04:30.240> all<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.390> was<00:04:30.570> needed<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.800> was<00:04:31.950> the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
that was all that was needed it was the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.720 
that was all that was needed it was the
right<00:04:32.700> decision<00:04:32.730> for<00:04:33.330> me
