00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.060
 yeah good day it's crif I'm from 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 back in my new environment 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.809
 that is to say my room in Grenoble where he 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.130
 was going a little bit bigger than 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.700
 the old one ie about three 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.530
 times bigger 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 finally basically our little one 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.870
 brain is a machine that makes good 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.130
 job 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.600
 except that sometimes he is touched by 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 syndromes related to dysfunction 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.480
 which causes some small worries 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 techniques 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 for example if at this specific place of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 brain you're touched that's called 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.980
 the era of broca you will not arrive press 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 practically more to talk about and if that's 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 in the air of wernicke is here you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.140
 will this time have a dog's pain to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.820
 understand what you are told or what 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.020
 you will be able to read for others 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 syndromes see that right away 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.750
 imagine you wake up after you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 are fracturing the skull while doing 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.070
 skate with 1.24 to each his delusions 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.329
 in your hospital room a 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 person who looks like trait for trait 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.510
 to your mother that's something else and she 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 speak to you as your mom does everything 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.899
 like your mom and yet this is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.579
 not she seeing her you know 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.440
 well that what it is a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.149
 unknown a lookalike that looks like him 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 then you love your mother obviously 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.320
 but she in clairvoyance you do not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.189
 feel absolutely nothing even if she 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 looks exactly like him 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.310
 it's like you're watching 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 empty shell is shit in 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 coming out of the hospital you realize 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.640
 that a look-alike has also taken on the appearance of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 your country and your friends they all 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.369
 been replaced by impostors 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.659
 passing for them that you can 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.830
 guess it because you do not feel any 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.630
 emotional warmth seeing them 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.939
 Well guess what well you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 victim of capra syndrome because these 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.259
 people are truly your parents 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.100
 and to your accident with what said to 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 jostle in your brain what we 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 could call 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.329
 the era of familiarity brooks is 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.770
 able to recognize people but 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.289
 all the feelings that binds to them are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.820
 cut the poma is not my father 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.200
 of equipped you hold see your boyfriend 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.429
 that you are supposed to love more than anything 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 but it makes you that much effect 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.679
 was going to see the little Piccolo charles who 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.329
 flees and so you are intimately 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.929
 convinced that it is an usurper who has 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.729
 took his place 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.770
 oh the dumpling it even happens to people 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.450
 Victims of 4 syndrome begin 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 insult me ​​hit what they believe 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.789
 to be the look - alikes of their loved ones 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.409
 it's a disorder that happen the most 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.270
 often in people with 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.929
 schizophrenia as much to say they are 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 not very clean at the base brad pitt a 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.170
 entrusted to a newspaper that one judges it is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.399
 often selfish and pretentious in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.299
 real life especially because it does not 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.590
 never remembered people he 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.000
 likewise met two minutes before 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.530
 and even if you typed the bib 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.030
 with him the whole evening then that you 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.110
 are away and what has bradley tank 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.519
 Chances are you will not be 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.470
 recognize if you come back but actually 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.790
 brad confessed to having pre opal 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.769
 bus ie his brain 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.690
 can not recognize and memorize 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.010
 the faces of people or in any case he 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.450
 has the greatest harm while it is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 brad any goal that's late 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 prosopagnosia his eyes a voice 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.760
 perfectly well he can spot the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 mouth the throne and where the buttons on the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.459
 plays etc 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.810
 but his brain does not come to 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.209
 memorize the whole paste the label 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 like that it's gilbert that's kevin 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.359
 that's the old machine 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.799
 it's as if each face was a 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.079
 box a few hours always holidays 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.069
 then as you guessed it is 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.540
 still a little annoying when 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.319
 we are suffering from prosopagnosia 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.420
 can not recognize me 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.299
 automatically his parents his friends or 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.859
 his kids just seeing them 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.620
 you have to give in for that of your voice 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.980
 or other details in their appearance 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.620
 hello madam sir and the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.849
 Prosopagnosia and a pity 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.440
 which affects several million people 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.190
 balances the chopper after an accident 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.190
 or birth 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.880
 you've probably seen a movie or 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.530
 a guy a bit that we build like 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.209
 flowers and that he realizes that he does not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.709
 control over the name of his hands this 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.849
 hand is endowed with his own will and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.860
 Moreover, do not hesitate to make 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.670
 that at his head or should I rather say 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.959
 that at his hand like an oak and this 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.819
 syndrome you guessed it thanks to 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.980
 your immense insight I hope 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.880
 really exists and it bears the name of the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 foreign hand syndrome 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.350
 this can happen for example following 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.540
 an operation that cuts the corpus callosum 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.340
 who stole the second then served 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.720
 keep feeling you tomorrow but you 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.790
 will have the impression that one of them 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.400
 is no longer controllable and that it seems 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 endowed with his own will and this hand 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.549
 for then you slap is like that without 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.380
 no reason tearing from your mouth 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.180
 moncigale you just turned on 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 your hand or then unbuttoned your 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.420
 shirt in business meetings 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 hyper serious good that said it's a 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 salon after it's a syndrome 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
 extremely to parma did not list 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.100
 so far has not so far barely 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.319
 do not worry daddy 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.000
 you do not risk in principle after 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.410
 you are banged the head m masturbate is 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.640
 this only with your left hand at 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.000
 full english oral in front of 200 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.070
 people 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.570
 or else it's a fantasy and that's 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.910
 still something else and then finally a 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.859
 syndrome as rare as I saw the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.000
 cotard syndrome also called syndrome 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.169
 people late and who believe themselves dead is 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.530
 rotting when in fact 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.820
 all is well they are no less 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.930
 patients with the syndrome of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.970
 cotard often feel that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.250
 their organs are rotting see they 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.900
 have more heart lung of all this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.000
 what and that he should have been buried and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.450
 since a lease but for a reason x or 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.580
 there 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.810
 death did not want me it's silly 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.190
 as cabbage they are a little bit in the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.380
 same state of mind that likes them 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.669
 zombies I was told no some are 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.150
 even convinced not to see their 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.300
 clean reflection 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.670
 mirror while their vision is normal 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.770
 for example the dead singer of his name 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.770
 of black metal band ryan 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.910
 okay okay who committed suicide on the 22nd and 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.290
 where summer probably has the syndrome 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.610
 gothard and make up like a 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.530
 corpse buried his clothes in a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.000
 cemetery before wearing them sniffing 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.580
 the mackerel rotting body that 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 kept in his bag to feel death 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.000
 and even in the process of slashing 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.350
 arm with shards of bottle and 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.640
 sometimes bleeding so much 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.050
 that he faints is in full concert 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.280
 since this cool guy we want 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.690
 to invite in the evening is spent him 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 well I hope that these syndromes 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.050
 have amused us and I find 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 personally that it still leaves 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.180
 a little thoughtful especially about 1 on 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.360
 the existence of the soul 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.360
 see you soon
