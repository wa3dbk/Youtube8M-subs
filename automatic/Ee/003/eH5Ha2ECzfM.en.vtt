saving<00:01:09.299> may<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> sound<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.950> if

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
saving may not sound like a lot but if

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510 
saving may not sound like a lot but if

we can eliminate 150 million kilograms
of<00:01:17.790> co2<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> taking<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.759> small

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
of co2 and so that's like taking a small

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.219 
of co2 and so that's like taking a small
power<00:01:21.420> plant<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.810> wanting<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:26.990> few<00:01:27.990> brands

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
power plant off wanting a few brands

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
power plant off wanting a few brands
have<00:01:28.409> introduced<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> new<00:01:29.189> 3d<00:01:29.520> technology<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
have introduced a new 3d technology this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
have introduced a new 3d technology this
year<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.860> uses<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.549> passive<00:01:32.790> glasses

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
year and it uses the passive glasses

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.190 
year and it uses the passive glasses
like<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> ones<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.470> use<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> movies<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
like the ones we use in the movies and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.359 
like the ones we use in the movies and
we've<00:01:37.200> done<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:37.560> research<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.159> area

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
we've done some research in this area

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
we've done some research in this area
and<00:01:38.700> found<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.360> consumers<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.110> like

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and found that consumers really like

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.069 
and found that consumers really like
this<00:01:40.560> new<00:01:40.770> technology<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:42.450> slim<00:01:42.810> comes

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this new technology where slim comes

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
this new technology where slim comes
into<00:01:43.290> play<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.159> used<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.579> conjunction

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
into play is if it's used in conjunction

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
into play is if it's used in conjunction
with<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> technology<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.860> either

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with this technology it can either

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
with this technology it can either
improve<00:01:48.000> viewing<00:01:48.450> area<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.930> increase

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
improve viewing area or increase

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.029 
improve viewing area or increase
brightness<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.460> both

one reason a customer may want to use a
thicker<00:02:44.470> glasses<00:02:45.310> because<00:02:45.459> they're

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
thicker glasses because they're

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.270 
thicker glasses because they're
concerned<00:02:46.030> about<00:02:46.209> damage<00:02:46.720> resistance<00:02:47.290> well

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
concerned about damage resistance well

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.620 
concerned about damage resistance well
this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.549> an<00:02:48.640> area<00:02:48.790> we've<00:02:49.060> been<00:02:49.090> looking<00:02:49.510> at

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
this is an area we've been looking at

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.020 
this is an area we've been looking at
we've<00:02:49.959> been<00:02:50.110> doing<00:02:50.380> some<00:02:50.560> modeling<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.190> what

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
we've been doing some modeling and what

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.420 
we've been doing some modeling and what
we<00:02:52.150> found<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> thinner<00:02:53.260> substrate<00:02:53.890> may

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
we found is that a thinner substrate may

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.309 
we found is that a thinner substrate may
actually<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:55.000> better<00:02:55.239> impact<00:02:55.750> resistance

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
actually have better impact resistance

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.860 
actually have better impact resistance
on<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.530> test<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.400> steel<00:02:57.640> ball<00:02:57.880> drop<00:02:58.180> but

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
on a test like a steel ball drop but

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.840 
on a test like a steel ball drop but
more<00:02:59.079> importantly<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.859> how<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.220> glass<00:03:00.549> is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
more importantly is how the glass is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.210 
more importantly is how the glass is
handled<00:03:01.239> once<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.569> leaves<00:03:01.780> our<00:03:01.989> factory<00:03:02.500> glass

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
handled once it leaves our factory glass

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.580 
handled once it leaves our factory glass
has<00:03:03.430> very<00:03:03.670> high<00:03:03.940> intrinsic<00:03:04.390> strength<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.410> we

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
has very high intrinsic strength so we

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530 
has very high intrinsic strength so we
work<00:03:05.769> very<00:03:05.799> closely<00:03:06.340> with<00:03:06.579> our<00:03:06.700> customers<00:03:07.329> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
work very closely with our customers so

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.420 
work very closely with our customers so
that<00:03:07.660> they<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.930> handle<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.319> properly<00:03:08.560> to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that they can handle it properly to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.220 
that they can handle it properly to
maintain<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.030> high<00:03:10.180> strength<00:03:10.569> in<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.989> panel

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the future 4xg slim glass is very bright

the future 4xg slim glass is very bright
we<00:03:20.290> continue<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.769> penetrate<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.489> we<00:03:21.609> sell

more each quarter than we did the

more each quarter than we did the
previous<00:03:23.799> quarter<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.579> think<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.450> challenge

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
previous quarter I think the challenge

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.670 
previous quarter I think the challenge
for<00:03:26.170> slimmer<00:03:27.099> glasses<00:03:27.719> it's<00:03:28.719> not<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.290> making

the glass it's in making the glass into
a<00:03:31.359> panel<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.140> that's<00:03:32.920> really<00:03:33.129> an<00:03:33.700> issue<00:03:33.939> for
