presentation<00:02:04.479> but<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.630> me<00:02:05.780> I'd<00:02:06.680> almost<00:02:06.890> say

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
presentation but to me I'd almost say

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.070 
presentation but to me I'd almost say
just<00:02:07.520> go<00:02:07.670> get<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.119> bottle<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.539> wine<00:02:08.810> or

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
just go get a bottle of wine or

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.330 
just go get a bottle of wine or
something<00:02:09.259> instead<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.709> doing<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.069> thing<00:02:10.250> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
something instead of doing this thing I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.540 
something instead of doing this thing I
mean<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> has<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.569> alcohol<00:02:12.080> content<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:13.100> for

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
mean it has the alcohol content but for

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.120 
mean it has the alcohol content but for
something<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.600> big<00:02:14.740> it'd<00:02:15.740> be<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> lot<00:02:16.069> better

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
something this big it'd be a lot better

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.740 
something this big it'd be a lot better
for<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.790> go<00:02:16.910> out<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.270> buy<00:02:17.420> the

in<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> corner<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.660> ciders<00:02:30.620> don't<00:02:30.950> really

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
in the corner but ciders don't really

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.540 
in the corner but ciders don't really
insinuate<00:02:32.660> bad<00:02:32.900> ass<00:02:33.140> out<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.410> somebody<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.519> I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
insinuate bad ass out of somebody so I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.920

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
think I'd give it a three out of five

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.300 
think I'd give it a three out of five
man<00:02:37.400> faces<00:02:37.820> because<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:38.810> interesting<00:02:39.310> it's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
decent but I don't think I'd go out of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.750 
decent but I don't think I'd go out of
my<00:02:42.170> way<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> definitely<00:02:43.250> would<00:02:43.580> hope

that would cost much less than seven
dollars<00:02:46.220> or<00:02:46.820> six<00:02:47.090> dollars<00:02:47.150> whatever<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.780> hell
