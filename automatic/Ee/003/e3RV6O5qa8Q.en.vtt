00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
okay guys it's a BB by mass video yeah I

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay guys it's a BB by mass video yeah I
know<00:00:08.250> I've<00:00:08.460> been<00:00:08.639> saying<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.269> last

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
might go back to my coolermaster v8

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.020 
might go back to my coolermaster v8
because<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.200> excuse<00:02:55.099> me<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.489> want<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.819> keep<00:02:55.970> my

but<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.600> last<00:03:23.780> time<00:03:23.959> i<00:03:24.019> had<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.319> fan<00:03:24.680> down<00:03:25.549> at

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
but the last time i had a fan down at

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.569 
but the last time i had a fan down at
the<00:03:25.790> bottom<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:26.389> i<00:03:26.980> was<00:03:27.980> getting<00:03:28.280> really

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
the bottom there i was getting really

the bottom there i was getting really
strange<00:03:29.120> temperatures<00:03:29.780> my<00:03:29.930> motherboard<00:03:30.410> went

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
strange temperatures my motherboard went

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.509 
strange temperatures my motherboard went
up<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.010> 55<00:03:31.910> celsius<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.859> what<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.130> do<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.400> the

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
up to 55 celsius so what to do with the

up to 55 celsius so what to do with the
wavy<00:03:34.880> airs<00:03:35.060> vented<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.769> i've<00:03:37.340> been<00:03:37.400> told<00:03:37.579> to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
wavy airs vented so i've been told to

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.740 
wavy airs vented so i've been told to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.150 
free day
they're<00:04:26.000> running<00:04:26.180> quite<00:04:26.510> nice<00:04:26.780> at<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.320> moment

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.510 

so<00:04:31.160> yeah<00:04:31.480> one<00:04:32.480> last<00:04:32.690> time<00:04:34.270> system<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.450> complete

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
so yeah one last time system is complete

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.470 
so yeah one last time system is complete
mm-hmm<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.610> anyway<00:04:40.820> if<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:41.270> use

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
mm-hmm but anyway if you use

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.210 
mm-hmm but anyway if you use
for<00:04:41.660> crossfire<00:04:42.080> cable<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.770> you're<00:04:42.950> getting

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
for crossfire cable that you're getting

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.660 
for crossfire cable that you're getting
the<00:04:43.310> box<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:43.700> each<00:04:43.820> graphics<00:04:44.300> card<00:04:45.580> it's<00:04:46.580> not

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
the box of each graphics card it's not

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.550 
the box of each graphics card it's not
long<00:04:47.030> enough<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.420> have<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.930> gap<00:04:48.290> in<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
long enough to have that gap in the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.800 
long enough to have that gap in the
middle<00:04:48.820> so<00:04:49.820> if<00:04:49.940> you<00:04:50.060> are<00:04:50.210> thinking<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.660> running

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
middle so if you are thinking of running

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.540 
middle so if you are thinking of running
to<00:04:51.080> 58<00:04:51.620> 70s<00:04:52.190> or<00:04:52.430> 259<00:04:53.150> 70s<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.020> really<00:04:55.010> do<00:04:55.190> advise

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
to 58 70s or 259 70s I really do advise

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.090 
to 58 70s or 259 70s I really do advise
that<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.060> get<00:04:56.450> a<00:04:56.480> motherboard<00:04:57.080> with<00:04:57.830> well

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
that you get a motherboard with well

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.590 
that you get a motherboard with well
spaced<00:04:58.520> out<00:04:58.820> 16<00:04:59.630> laying<00:04:59.960> PCI<00:05:00.530> Express<00:05:00.950> ports

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
spaced out 16 laying PCI Express ports

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.000 
spaced out 16 laying PCI Express ports
all<00:05:02.600> of<00:05:02.930> my<00:05:03.110> PCI<00:05:03.650> Express<00:05:04.040> ports<00:05:04.690> are<00:05:05.690> 16<00:05:06.320> speed

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
all of my PCI Express ports are 16 speed

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.050 
all of my PCI Express ports are 16 speed
rather<00:05:07.820> than<00:05:08.030> eight<00:05:08.230> so<00:05:09.550> it's<00:05:10.550> nice<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:11.000> have

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
rather than eight so it's nice to have

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.610 
rather than eight so it's nice to have
them<00:05:11.240> well<00:05:11.420> spaced<00:05:11.720> out<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.140> temperatures

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
them well spaced out but temperatures

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.960 
them well spaced out but temperatures
will<00:05:12.650> go<00:05:12.980> through<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.340> roof<00:05:13.520> otherwise

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
will go through the roof otherwise

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.900 
will go through the roof otherwise
you're<00:05:14.690> looking<00:05:14.960> at<00:05:15.080> 85<00:05:15.680> 90<00:05:16.220> Celsius<00:05:16.730> on

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
you're looking at 85 90 Celsius on

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.760 
you're looking at 85 90 Celsius on
unload<00:05:17.390> if<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.720> don't<00:05:17.900> space<00:05:18.230> form<00:05:18.470> out<00:05:18.590> like

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
unload if you don't space form out like

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.680 
unload if you don't space form out like
I<00:05:18.980> have<00:05:19.160> but<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.090> will<00:05:20.330> need<00:05:20.630> an<00:05:20.930> extra-long

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
I have but you will need an extra-long

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.150 
I have but you will need an extra-long
crossfire<00:05:23.690> cable<00:05:23.930> which<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.620> will<00:05:24.830> get<00:05:25.010> in

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
crossfire cable which you will get in
