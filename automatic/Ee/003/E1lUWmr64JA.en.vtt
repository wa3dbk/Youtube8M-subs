the chances of the computer actually
catching<00:04:29.599> your<00:04:29.690> ball<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.319> you<00:04:30.500> target<00:04:30.770> a

player who's not quick

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.070 
player who's not quick
you<00:04:34.940> can<00:04:35.090> tell<00:04:35.300> who<00:04:35.450> you're<00:04:35.600> going<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.900> pass

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080

you can tell who you're going to pass
the<00:04:36.260> ball<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.440> because<00:04:36.830> his<00:04:37.160> hands<00:04:37.400> will<00:04:37.640> be

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
the ball to because his hands will be

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.130 
the ball to because his hands will be
moving<00:04:37.970> on<00:04:38.240> them<00:04:38.390> so<00:04:38.510> if<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.630> want<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.960> pass

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140

do more damn china is supposed to have
good<00:05:08.420> catch<00:05:08.690> technique<00:05:09.140> but<00:05:09.350> they<00:05:09.440> actually

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
good catch technique but they actually

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.320 
good catch technique but they actually
don't<00:05:09.920> do<00:05:10.040> a<00:05:10.070> very<00:05:10.160> good<00:05:10.400> job<00:05:10.550> catching<00:05:11.240> the

don't do a very good job catching the
ball<00:05:11.510> at<00:05:11.660> all<00:05:11.750> we<00:05:11.990> have<00:05:12.020> really<00:05:12.380> low<00:05:12.740> endurance

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
ball at all we have really low endurance

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.560 
ball at all we have really low endurance
which<00:05:13.640> means<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.060> finish<00:05:14.330> them<00:05:14.450> off

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
which means that you finish them off

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.560 
which means that you finish them off
superfast<00:05:15.910> normally<00:05:16.910> when<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.120> play<00:05:17.300> against

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
them Wang throws a breaker also so

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.790 
them Wang throws a breaker also so
usually<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.810> best<00:05:21.050> technique<00:05:21.440> for<00:05:21.650> catching

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
usually the best technique for catching

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.950 
usually the best technique for catching
the<00:05:22.040> breakers<00:05:22.400> either<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:23.420> stand<00:05:23.660> way<00:05:23.930> back

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
the breakers either to stand way back

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.710 
the breakers either to stand way back
and<00:05:24.410> get<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.190> ball<00:05:25.340> after<00:05:25.580> it's<00:05:26.090> broken<00:05:26.390> and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
and get the ball after it's broken and

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.360 
and get the ball after it's broken and
still<00:05:26.900> going<00:05:27.110> forward<00:05:27.380> towards<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:27.890> or<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.250> go

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
ball break towards you you can also just

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.210 
ball break towards you you can also just
stuck<00:05:32.660> under<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.050> ball<00:05:33.200> but<00:05:33.560> chances<00:05:34.100> are

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
stuck under the ball but chances are

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.590 
stuck under the ball but chances are
it's<00:05:34.310> going<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.520> go<00:05:34.610> into<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:34.940> sidelines<00:05:35.390> and

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
it's going to go into the sidelines and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.480 
it's going to go into the sidelines and
you're<00:05:35.720> gonna<00:05:35.870> get<00:05:36.020> fall<00:05:36.320> back<00:05:42.190> next<00:05:43.190> up<00:05:43.370> is

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
you're gonna get fall back next up is

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.070 
you're gonna get fall back next up is
Kenya<00:05:43.850> this<00:05:44.090> can<00:05:44.240> be<00:05:44.330> a<00:05:44.360> hard<00:05:44.570> field<00:05:44.870> for

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
Kenya this can be a hard field for

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.720 
Kenya this can be a hard field for
players<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.560> do<00:05:45.680> power<00:05:45.919> moves<00:05:46.040> on<00:05:46.400> at<00:05:46.520> first

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
players to do power moves on at first

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.460 
players to do power moves on at first
because<00:05:47.120> there's<00:05:47.330> sand<00:05:47.630> on<00:05:47.840> it<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.169> you<00:05:48.230> run

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
because there's sand on it so you run

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.750 
because there's sand on it so you run
differently<00:05:48.950> and<00:05:49.160> you<00:05:49.220> have<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.430> charge<00:05:49.669> it

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
differently and you have to charge it

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760 
differently and you have to charge it
for<00:05:49.820> power<00:05:50.120> moves<00:05:50.360> differently<00:05:50.590> just<00:05:51.590> pay

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
for power moves differently just pay

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.560 
for power moves differently just pay
attention<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:52.370> how<00:05:52.550> I'm<00:05:52.760> doing<00:05:53.090> these<00:05:53.180> power

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
attention to how I'm doing these power

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.690 
attention to how I'm doing these power
moves<00:05:53.780> in<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.050> street<00:05:54.320> let's<00:05:54.530> do<00:05:54.710> them<00:05:54.890> -<00:05:55.100> it's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
moves in the street let's do them - it's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.010 
moves in the street let's do them - it's
actually<00:05:55.820> nice<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:56.570> don't<00:05:56.690> have<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.870> run

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
actually nice and so don't have to run

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.900 
actually nice and so don't have to run
nearly<00:05:57.440> as<00:05:57.560> far<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.980> do<00:05:58.100> a<00:05:58.130> ground<00:05:58.310> power<00:05:58.640> move

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
nearly as far to do a ground power move

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.340 
nearly as far to do a ground power move
so<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.300> can<00:05:59.419> hit<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.570> lot<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.810> players<00:06:00.140> as

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
so it can hit a lot of players as

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.720 
so it can hit a lot of players as
they're<00:06:00.500> going<00:06:00.710> back<00:06:00.860> towards<00:06:01.220> their<00:06:01.430> side<00:06:01.700> of

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
they're going back towards their side of

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.350 
they're going back towards their side of
the<00:06:01.910> field

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.700 

notice<00:06:05.360> how<00:06:05.509> it's<00:06:05.659> also<00:06:05.870> possible<00:06:06.169> to<00:06:06.439> etch

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
notice how it's also possible to etch

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.499 
notice how it's also possible to etch
power<00:06:07.009> moves<00:06:07.279> right<00:06:07.550> after<00:06:07.909> their<00:06:08.060> crown<00:06:08.300> by

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
power moves right after their crown by

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:14.900 
power moves right after their crown by
your<00:06:08.719> phone

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.400 

you<00:06:15.910> can<00:06:16.090> see<00:06:16.270> Taha<00:06:16.660> also<00:06:17.050> throws<00:06:17.259> the

you can see Taha also throws the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.400 
you can see Taha also throws the
lightning<00:06:17.740> like<00:06:17.919> Bill<00:06:18.100> of<00:06:18.220> Team<00:06:18.430> USA
