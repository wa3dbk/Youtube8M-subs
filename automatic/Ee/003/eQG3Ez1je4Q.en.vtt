to start with the right hand so we're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.390 
to start with the right hand so we're
placing<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.270> left<00:00:18.600> hand<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.529> hip<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.400> the

right hand comes out palm outwards

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.339 
right hand comes out palm outwards
facing<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> right<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:30.300> eyes<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:31.080> follow

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
facing the right the eyes will follow

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.569 
facing the right the eyes will follow
the<00:00:31.679> hand<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> eyes<00:00:34.530> however<00:00:34.739> never<00:00:35.340> go

the hand the eyes however never go

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.510 
the hand the eyes however never go
downwards<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:37.020> move<00:00:37.710> off<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.309> left

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
downwards so as we move off to the left
and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> hand<00:00:38.940> circles<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.780> gonna<00:00:39.960> keep

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and the hand circles we're gonna keep

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
and the hand circles we're gonna keep
the<00:00:40.320> eyes<00:00:41.000> simply<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.360> direction<00:00:42.570> as

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the eyes simply in the same direction as

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.069 
the eyes simply in the same direction as
hand<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.059> start<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.590> motion<00:00:47.840> our<00:00:48.840> weight

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
hand so to start this motion our weight

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.750 
hand so to start this motion our weight
is<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.129> foot<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> front<00:00:51.210> side

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
is on the right foot to the front side

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
is on the right foot to the front side
we're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> start<00:00:54.180> by<00:00:54.750> allowing<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
we're going to start by allowing the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
we're going to start by allowing the
hand<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.899> circle<00:00:58.289> downwards<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> weight

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
hand to circle downwards and the weight

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.850 
hand to circle downwards and the weight
goes<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> back<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.129> side<00:01:02.629> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
goes to the back of the right side and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
goes to the back of the right side and
starts<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> transfer<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> front<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> left

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
starts to transfer to the front and left

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.500 
starts to transfer to the front and left
so<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> palm<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.610> starting<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> face

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so the palm is now starting to face

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
so the palm is now starting to face
upwards<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.250> transferring<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> weight

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
upwards and we're transferring a weight

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.860 
upwards and we're transferring a weight
to<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> left<00:01:15.869> side

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.690 

so<00:01:19.870> now<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.140> weight<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:21.010> transferred<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.550> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
so now the weight is transferred to the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
so now the weight is transferred to the
frontal<00:01:22.030> left<00:01:22.270> then<00:01:23.550> we<00:01:24.550> turn<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.090> arm<00:01:25.390> over

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
frontal left then we turn the arm over

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.040 
frontal left then we turn the arm over
turn<00:01:27.340> over<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.670> shoulder<00:01:28.030> as<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.570> weight

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
turn over the shoulder as the weight

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.359 
turn over the shoulder as the weight
moves<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.740> back<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.729> left<00:01:30.940> hand<00:01:31.210> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380 

we<00:01:36.369> turn<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.940> hand<00:01:37.210> over<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:40.030> back<00:01:40.060> to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
we turn the hand over and go back to

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.350 
we turn the hand over and go back to
where<00:01:40.509> we<00:01:40.570> started<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.250> hand<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.700> taking<00:01:43.090> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
where we started so the hand is taking a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:55.430 
where we started so the hand is taking a
large<00:01:44.200> circular<00:01:44.710> motion

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.540 

inhaling<00:01:56.370> as<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.970> hand<00:01:57.240> comes<00:01:57.360> under

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.760 

as<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:09.090> hand<00:02:09.450> comes<00:02:09.690> under<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
as a hand comes under we're going to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.979 
as a hand comes under we're going to
feel<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> energy<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.880> into<00:02:12.330> our<00:02:12.450> pinky<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
feel the energy going into our pinky and

twisting someone backing up going over

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.290 
twisting someone backing up going over
that<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.860> energy<00:02:20.220> goes<00:02:20.430> into<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.420> thumb<00:02:21.980> and
