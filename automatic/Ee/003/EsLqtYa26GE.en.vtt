00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
increased and a mutation that

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.590 
increased and a mutation that
increase<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.310> effects<00:04:26.670> was<00:04:26.910> probably<00:04:27.510> a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
increase the effects was probably a

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
increase the effects was probably a
pro-survival<00:04:28.230> effect<00:04:29.070> that<00:04:29.850> helped<00:04:30.620> early

pro-survival effect that helped early

suggests that that ate occurred in the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.530 
suggests that that ate occurred in the
area<00:04:38.250> where<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.550> where<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:39.000> cooling<00:04:39.390> will

then<00:04:42.180> migrated<00:04:42.810> out<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.260> super<00:04:43.620> 8<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.040> it's

then migrated out the super 8 and it's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.120 
then migrated out the super 8 and it's
completely<00:04:45.210> consistent<00:04:45.660> with<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.710> yura<00:04:46.890> case

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
completely consistent with the yura case

completely consistent with the yura case

in<00:04:52.350> London<00:04:52.580> on<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.690> we<00:04:54.840> think<00:04:55.020> this

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
in London on this so we think this

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.530 
in London on this so we think this
