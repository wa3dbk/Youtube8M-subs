injection<00:00:17.850> burn<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.650> involves<00:00:20.039> is

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
injection burn so what that involves is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.540 
injection burn so what that involves is
waiting<00:00:21.960> till<00:00:22.170> our<00:00:22.320> liftoff<00:00:22.890> time<00:00:23.220> goes

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
injection burn hey guys I've launched

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.399 
injection burn hey guys I've launched
and<00:01:36.960> him<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> stable<00:01:38.009> Earth<00:01:38.250> orbit<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:40.200> thing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and him in stable Earth orbit one thing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.420 
and him in stable Earth orbit one thing
I<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.650> say<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> should<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.310> done

I would say that you should have done
while<00:01:41.610> launching<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> forgot<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> mention

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
while launching that I forgot to mention

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.940 
while launching that I forgot to mention
is<00:01:43.320> hit<00:01:43.820> projection<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> says<00:01:45.360> self<00:01:45.950> next

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
is hit projection so it says self next

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.319 
is hit projection so it says self next
thing<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.090> real

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
thing you want to do is go down to real

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.999 
thing you want to do is go down to real
time<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.899> change<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.530> pro<00:01:49.740> great

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
time and change that to pro great

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.600 
time and change that to pro great
exactly<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.880> last<00:01:51.060> time<00:01:51.590> hit<00:01:52.590> mode<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
exactly like last time hit mode and you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
exactly like last time hit mode and you
got<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.880> burn<00:01:54.060> time<00:01:54.390> which<00:01:54.689> will<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:55.020> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
got your burn time which will be in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.249 
got your burn time which will be in
about<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.770> thousand<00:01:56.399> seconds<00:01:56.840> hepburn<00:01:57.840> vector

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
about a thousand seconds hepburn vector

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.700 
about a thousand seconds hepburn vector
and<00:01:58.469> I'll<00:01:59.280> help<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> too<00:02:00.710> fast

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and I'll help you out of it too fast

and I'll help you out of it too fast
forward<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.960> think<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> reason<00:02:04.259> ship<00:02:04.530> drags

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
forward I think the reason ship drags

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
forward I think the reason ship drags
Yuri<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.340> left<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.390> there's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Yuri a left and right is because there's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
Yuri a left and right is because there's
some<00:02:06.750> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> weight<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.469> balance<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
some kind of weight in balance in the

like<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.100> computer<00:02:29.400> performing<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.090> burn

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
like the computer performing this burn

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.990 
like the computer performing this burn
so<00:02:31.200> I'm<00:02:31.260> gonna<00:02:31.380> switch<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.740> our<00:02:31.920> CS<00:02:32.310> rotational

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so I'm gonna switch to our CS rotational

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.460 
so I'm gonna switch to our CS rotational
and<00:02:33.120> I'm<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.690> orient<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> ship<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.350> my

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and I'm going to orient the ship on my

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
and I'm going to orient the ship on my

six parts everything's just all bunched
together<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.019> engage<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.930> our<00:03:21.930> burn<00:03:22.920> time

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
together and engage and our burn time

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.910 
together and engage and our burn time
has<00:03:23.549> dropped<00:03:24.000> significantly<00:03:24.239> suddenly<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.830> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
has dropped significantly suddenly and I

am done with this burn alright guys just
like<00:03:33.330> usual<00:03:33.750> adjusting<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.739> burn<00:03:35.160> time<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
like usual adjusting the burn time to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.590 
like usual adjusting the burn time to
the<00:03:36.150> very<00:03:36.630> most<00:03:37.170> perfect<00:03:37.620> i<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.600> all

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the very most perfect i can get it all

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.580 
the very most perfect i can get it all
right<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:41.150> that's<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.510> part<00:03:42.570> two<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.500> as

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
right and that's it for part two so as

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
right and that's it for part two so as
you<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.739> see<00:03:43.890> everything<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.370> lot<00:03:44.579> more

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
you can see everything is a lot more

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.280 
you can see everything is a lot more
condensed<00:03:45.269> now<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.750> we're<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.170> get

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
condensed now and we're going to get

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.660 
condensed now and we're going to get
through<00:03:46.350> everything<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.860> lot<00:03:46.950> faster<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.610> you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
through everything a lot faster so you

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.430 
through everything a lot faster so you
can<00:03:47.850> re-enter<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.390> Earth's<00:03:48.480> atmosphere<00:03:48.840> and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
can re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.420 
can re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and
learn<00:03:50.010> exactly<00:03:50.190> how<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:51.420> MFD<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.590> used<00:03:53.220> for

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
learn exactly how I MFD can be used for

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.150 
learn exactly how I MFD can be used for
any<00:03:53.610> interplanetary<00:03:54.540> trip<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.769> all<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
any interplanetary trip and it's all the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.069 
any interplanetary trip and it's all the
same<00:03:56.370> except<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.630> can<00:03:57.750> be<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> slightly

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
same except it can be a slightly

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.569 
same except it can be a slightly
different<00:03:58.350> from<00:03:58.530> moon<00:03:58.769> trips<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.400> also

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
different from moon trips but you also

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.880 
different from moon trips but you also
learned<00:03:59.850> that<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> Apollo<00:04:00.420> tutorials<00:04:00.959> so

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
learned that in the Apollo tutorials so

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.340 
learned that in the Apollo tutorials so
see<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.370> next<00:04:02.430> time<00:04:02.730> i<00:04:02.910> read<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.180> quicksave<00:04:03.570> all

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
see you next time i read a quicksave all

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.010 
see you next time i read a quicksave all
