00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.510
 namely by 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.940
 I am here in Ulm basketball to 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:21.440
 now one and a half years come here to 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.390
 school and hope so soon hope so 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.700
 to become a pro in the near future and some 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.400
 earn something 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.970
 we are just the young players here 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.060
 brought 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.400
 who have the prospect or that 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.520
 potential maybe in the bbl card too 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.520
 come 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.559
 we live together here 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.900
 We all go to school and train 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.330
 next to it of course shaped as a school 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.650
 I come here after a little sleep 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.489
 homework and then in the evening 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.970
 In the beginning it was training, first of all 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.710
 to be away from my family 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.900
 yes I I've always been relatively 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.699
 self-contained but it was easy 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.890
 something completely different so the mother or 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.900
 father does not always have to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.590
 I feel really good now 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.470
 can not change now 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.610
 actually imagine 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.049
 So I'm sitting mostly small training 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 we have the opportunity to place 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.810
 go and then in the evening so mostly 20 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.130
 easter team training 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.430
 it just feels good to win 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 and to ensure success 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.070
 there is nothing better 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.570
 I am three teams and we 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 understand each other really well 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.820
 yes, like family actually 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.170
 playing field there one actually forgets 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.560
 also everything if you just now 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.500
 scholastic stress or that simple 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.670
 simply hidden 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.079
 when I watch football games 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.759
 just see that the worse 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.180
 Team wins it is for me 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.100
 easy 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.240
 then that did not happen here too 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 play and what is there fast that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 the worse team wins 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.340
 that's important in any case 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.520
 that gives here and the chance to get 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.360
 and just being here is easy 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.980
 really awesome and you should open it up 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.610
 appreciate every case and so too 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.530
 As Ulmer I have one last year 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.739
 signed three-year contract 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.420
 and now my second year and he 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.959
 Just lit up until you already with 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.810
 mendes 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.250
 that means no matter if we are still out then 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.549
 I assume that I am here 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.780
 probably just extend it 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.780
 Let's see what the future is
