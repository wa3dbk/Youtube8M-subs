00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.010 

we're<00:00:03.830> gonna<00:00:03.949> switch<00:00:04.250> gears<00:00:04.279> now<00:00:04.760> and<00:00:05.300> move<00:00:05.660> on

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
we're gonna switch gears now and move on

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.289 
we're gonna switch gears now and move on
to<00:00:06.290> a<00:00:06.319> tip<00:00:06.650> number<00:00:06.830> 18<00:00:07.520> which<00:00:07.819> is<00:00:07.850> a<00:00:07.970> slightly

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299 
to a tip number 18 which is a slightly

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.600 
to a tip number 18 which is a slightly
more<00:00:08.450> open<00:00:08.719> star<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:09.469> do<00:00:09.620> our<00:00:09.740> zigzag<00:00:10.280> puffs

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
more open star to do our zigzag puffs

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.910 
more open star to do our zigzag puffs
for<00:00:11.300> this<00:00:11.450> technique<00:00:11.929> it's<00:00:12.170> basically<00:00:12.679> the

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
for this technique it's basically the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.280 
for this technique it's basically the
same<00:00:13.160> as<00:00:13.219> doing<00:00:13.550> a<00:00:13.759> zig<00:00:13.969> zag<00:00:14.049> except<00:00:15.049> for<00:00:15.200> using

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
same as doing a zig zag except for using

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.260 
same as doing a zig zag except for using
a<00:00:15.500> larger<00:00:15.830> tip<00:00:16.070> though<00:00:16.490> we're<00:00:16.640> also<00:00:16.849> holding

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
a larger tip though we're also holding

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.870 
a larger tip though we're also holding
our<00:00:17.660> bag<00:00:17.900> at<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.230> 45<00:00:18.259> degree<00:00:18.770> angle<00:00:18.950> we're<00:00:19.730> gonna

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
our bag at a 45 degree angle we're gonna

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.450 
our bag at a 45 degree angle we're gonna
pipe<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.480> zig<00:00:20.750> zag<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.349> we're<00:00:21.680> gonna<00:00:21.800> make<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
pipe a zig zag and we're gonna make the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.120 
pipe a zig zag and we're gonna make the
zig<00:00:22.700> zag<00:00:23.000> slightly<00:00:23.689> larger<00:00:24.590> towards<00:00:24.980> the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
zig zag slightly larger towards the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.679 
zig zag slightly larger towards the
middle<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:25.579> we're<00:00:25.700> gonna<00:00:25.790> squeeze<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.270> little

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
middle and we're gonna squeeze a little

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.870 
middle and we're gonna squeeze a little
bit<00:00:26.809> harder<00:00:27.290> in<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.950> middle<00:00:28.220> of<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.460> zig<00:00:28.669> zag

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
bit harder in the middle of the zig zag

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.019 
bit harder in the middle of the zig zag
puff<00:00:29.180> so<00:00:29.540> that<00:00:29.930> it<00:00:30.230> looks<00:00:30.710> like<00:00:30.950> it's<00:00:31.250> built<00:00:31.790> up

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
puff so that it looks like it's built up

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.880 
puff so that it looks like it's built up
in<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.360> center<00:00:32.780> again<00:00:33.350> here's<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.620> slightly

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
in the center again here's a slightly

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.520 
in the center again here's a slightly
different<00:00:34.190> angle<00:00:34.700> notice<00:00:35.630> that<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.080> squeezed<00:00:36.500> a

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
different angle notice that I squeezed a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.350 
different angle notice that I squeezed a
little<00:00:36.830> bit<00:00:37.040> harder<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.700> make<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.120> zig

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
little bit harder and I make the zig

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.200 
little bit harder and I make the zig
zags<00:00:38.630> larger<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.710> give<00:00:39.830> it<00:00:39.920> more<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.130> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
zags larger to give it more of a

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.180 
zags larger to give it more of a
3-dimensional<00:00:41.210> puffy<00:00:42.170> kind<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.650> look<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.130> is

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
3-dimensional puffy kind of look this is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.550 
3-dimensional puffy kind of look this is
a<00:00:43.340> fun<00:00:43.790> thing<00:00:44.060> to<00:00:44.120> do<00:00:44.420> along<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.750> bottom<00:00:45.230> or<00:00:45.320> even

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
a fun thing to do along a bottom or even

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:55.819 
a fun thing to do along a bottom or even
a<00:00:45.650> side<00:00:45.890> border

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.200 

shells<00:00:56.829> are<00:00:57.070> probably<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.579> most<00:00:57.730> commonly

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
shells are probably the most commonly

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.569 
shells are probably the most commonly
used<00:00:58.329> piping<00:00:59.290> technique<00:00:59.680> you<00:00:59.890> see<00:01:00.070> them<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.520> a

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
used piping technique you see them on a

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.420 
used piping technique you see them on a
lot<00:01:01.120> of<00:01:01.329> borders<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.230> want<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.620> use<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.890> tip

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
lot of borders you want to use a tip

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.810 
lot of borders you want to use a tip
number<00:01:03.760> 21<00:01:04.300> for<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.680> size<00:01:06.010> of<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.310> shell<00:01:06.550> and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
number 21 for this size of a shell and

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.600 
number 21 for this size of a shell and
we're<00:01:07.330> gonna<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.750> our<00:01:08.080> tip<00:01:08.409> at<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.680> 45<00:01:09.430> degree

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
we're gonna have our tip at a 45 degree

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.790 
we're gonna have our tip at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.300> surface<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:11.320> trick<00:01:11.619> with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
angle to the surface the trick with

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.550 
angle to the surface the trick with
shells<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.300> hold<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.930> tip<00:01:14.170> steady

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
shells is that you hold the tip steady

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.680 
shells is that you hold the tip steady
and<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.950> squeeze<00:01:15.490> letting<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> icing<00:01:16.420> build

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
and you squeeze letting the icing build

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.510 
and you squeeze letting the icing build
up<00:01:16.900> in<00:01:17.080> front<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.619> tip<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.009> then<00:01:18.430> you

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
up in front of the tip and then you

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.700 
up in front of the tip and then you
gradually<00:01:19.060> release<00:01:19.630> pressure<00:01:19.960> as<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.320> pull

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
gradually release pressure as you pull

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.100 
gradually release pressure as you pull
the<00:01:20.920> tip<00:01:21.160> back<00:01:21.580> that's<00:01:22.240> what<00:01:22.509> gives<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the tip back that's what gives you the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.950 
the tip back that's what gives you the
shell<00:01:23.380> shape<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:25.180> important<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.720> remember

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
shell shape it's important to remember

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.230 
shell shape it's important to remember
to<00:01:26.140> allow<00:01:26.380> space<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.220> front<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.700> tip<00:01:27.970> for

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
to allow space in front of the tip for

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.359 
to allow space in front of the tip for
the<00:01:28.330> icing<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.750> build<00:01:29.140> up<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.920> then<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.160> get<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
the icing to build up so then you get a

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.120 
the icing to build up so then you get a
nice<00:01:30.580> rounded<00:01:31.360> shell<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:32.500> when<00:01:32.770> you're<00:01:32.979> doing

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
nice rounded shell so when you're doing

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070 
nice rounded shell so when you're doing
a<00:01:33.340> shell<00:01:33.610> border<00:01:34.090> for<00:01:34.330> example<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:35.050> don't

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
a shell border for example you don't

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.960 
a shell border for example you don't
want<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.530> position<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.039> tip<00:01:36.310> where<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.729> want

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
want to position the tip where you want

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.490 
want to position the tip where you want
the<00:01:37.180> beginning<00:01:37.660> of<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.869> next<00:01:38.020> shell<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.470> be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
the beginning of the next shell to be

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.820 
the beginning of the next shell to be
you<00:01:38.830> want<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.039> position<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.520> further<00:01:39.850> back

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
you want to position it further back

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.560 
you want to position it further back
this<00:01:41.830> will<00:01:42.100> allow<00:01:42.399> proper<00:01:42.700> spacing<00:01:43.210> in

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
this will allow proper spacing in

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.450 
this will allow proper spacing in
between<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.140> shells<00:01:44.410> because<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.039> icing

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
between the shells because the icing

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.790 
between the shells because the icing
will<00:01:45.490> build<00:01:45.850> up<00:01:46.000> in<00:01:46.180> front<00:01:46.539> of<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.840> tip<00:01:47.080> as<00:01:47.289> you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
will build up in front of the tip as you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.719 
will build up in front of the tip as you
squeeze<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.399> out<00:01:50.190> hopefully<00:01:51.190> with<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.460> more

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
squeeze it out hopefully with this more

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.029 
squeeze it out hopefully with this more
aerial<00:01:52.240> view<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.720> can<00:01:52.929> see<00:01:53.200> how<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.530> icing

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
aerial view you can see how the icing

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.160 
aerial view you can see how the icing
builds<00:01:54.460> up<00:01:54.640> in<00:01:54.820> front<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> tip<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.140> don't
