00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.420 
tough so the bat swing is a little show
slow<00:04:19.180> but<00:04:19.449> come<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.780> fuck<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:21.130> way<00:04:21.370> too

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
slow but come the fuck on it's way too

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.629 
slow but come the fuck on it's way too
slow<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.030> clunky<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.479> times<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.979> should<00:04:24.310> be

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
slow and clunky at times it should be

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.490 
slow and clunky at times it should be
more<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:24.880> lovely<00:04:25.419> looking<00:04:25.510> dead<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.139> true

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
more like lovely looking dead and true

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.409 
more like lovely looking dead and true
it<00:04:26.740> adds<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.280> tense<00:04:27.520> feeling<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> can't

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
it adds the tense feeling that you can't

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.659 
it adds the tense feeling that you can't
take<00:04:28.630> many<00:04:28.870> zombies<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.470> at<00:04:29.680> once<00:04:29.889> but<00:04:30.430> if<00:04:30.639> you

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
take many zombies on at once but if you

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.550 
take many zombies on at once but if you
want<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.090> realistic<00:04:31.630> approach<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:32.200> this<00:04:32.320> world

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
want a realistic approach in this world

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.620 
want a realistic approach in this world
of<00:04:32.740> zombies<00:04:33.160> which<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.520> game<00:04:33.760> gives<00:04:34.060> most<00:04:34.360> of

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
of zombies which this game gives most of

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.450 
of zombies which this game gives most of
the<00:04:35.050> melee<00:04:35.470> shouldn't<00:04:35.830> feel<00:04:36.010> like<00:04:36.040> I'm<00:04:36.370> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
the melee shouldn't feel like I'm a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.670 
the melee shouldn't feel like I'm a
400-pound<00:04:37.210> men<00:04:37.419> every<00:04:37.780> time<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.020> swing<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.500> bat

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
400-pound men every time I swing the bat

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.650 
400-pound men every time I swing the bat
I<00:04:38.979> also<00:04:39.580> felt<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.180> story<00:04:40.419> could<00:04:40.600> have

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
I also felt that the story could have

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.420 
I also felt that the story could have
been<00:04:40.840> better<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.350> not<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> terrible<00:04:41.860> one<00:04:42.190> but

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
been better it's not a terrible one but

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.700 
been better it's not a terrible one but
it<00:04:42.520> has<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.810> does<00:04:44.050> definitely<00:04:44.290> have<00:04:44.590> some

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
it has and it does definitely have some

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.790 
it has and it does definitely have some
interesting<00:04:45.130> ideas<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:46.300> I<00:04:46.540> just<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.770> know

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
interesting ideas but I just you know
