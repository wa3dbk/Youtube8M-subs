first might try to put this together
with<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> ramp<00:00:33.300> unfolded<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.309> little<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with the ramp unfolded a little bit of a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.340 
with the ramp unfolded a little bit of a
hard<00:00:35.790> time<00:00:35.850> doing<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.989> realize<00:00:37.320> that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
hard time doing that they realize that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
hard time doing that they realize that
it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.860> easier<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> together<00:00:38.760> we

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it was easier to put it together we

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.270 
it was easier to put it together we
captured<00:00:40.110> everything<00:00:40.559> all<00:00:40.739> flows<00:00:41.010> together

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
captured everything all flows together

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
captured everything all flows together
so<00:00:42.149> very<00:00:42.360> simple<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.559> four<00:00:43.800> pegs

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so very simple you have your four pegs

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.740 
so very simple you have your four pegs
there<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> bottom<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:48.660> just

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
there in the bottom of this one you just

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
there in the bottom of this one you just
have<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> line<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.530> holes<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.280> depends

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
have to line the holes up with depends

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
have to line the holes up with depends
obviously<00:00:56.840> as<00:00:57.840> simple<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.859> all's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
obviously as simple as that now all's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
obviously as simple as that now all's
you<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.180> lift<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.750> give

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you have to do is lift this up and give

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.330 
you have to do is lift this up and give
you<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.590> truck<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> we'll<00:01:02.190> put

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you on the back your truck and we'll put

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.359 
you on the back your truck and we'll put
our<00:01:02.460> straps<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> unfold<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.830> ramp

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I find it's a lot easier if you set your

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
I find it's a lot easier if you set your
ramp<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> ground<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.549> unfold<00:01:11.880> each

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
