myself<00:00:11.240> of<00:00:12.240> all<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> games<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.200> probably<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
myself of all the games is probably the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.700 
myself of all the games is probably the
toughest<00:00:14.719> reason<00:00:15.719> being<00:00:15.929> that<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.500> all

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
toughest reason being that it's all

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
toughest reason being that it's all
about<00:00:17.359> your<00:00:18.359> controller<00:00:18.750> feel<00:00:19.080> rather<00:00:19.439> than

about your controller feel rather than

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.740 
about your controller feel rather than

white line to that white mark and you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.789 
white line to that white mark and you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you get a ringer and so those two

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.620 
you get a ringer and so those two
ringers<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.439> six<00:01:22.920> points<00:01:23.220> pretty<00:01:23.460> much

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
expert at this game whatsoever like I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.740 
expert at this game whatsoever like I
said<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> worst<00:01:45.479> game

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
said I think it's the worst game

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
said I think it's the worst game
probably<00:01:46.049> cuz<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> hardest<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> one

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
probably cuz the hardest like that one

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
probably cuz the hardest like that one
pretty<00:01:48.570> close<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.590> isn't<00:01:49.799> close<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
pretty close right not isn't close to
