but that's perfectly fine I do see some
of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.060> length<00:01:08.409> difference<00:01:09.409> from<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.369> set

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
of the length difference from this set

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.459 
of the length difference from this set
of<00:01:10.700> minutes<00:01:10.939> just<00:01:11.090> idea<00:01:11.509> from<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.840> last<00:01:12.110> set

back and the two sides so I'm going to
just<00:01:41.599> so<00:01:41.719> section<00:01:42.079> off<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.319> side<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:44.109> middle

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
just so section off the side this middle

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.050 
just so section off the side this middle
